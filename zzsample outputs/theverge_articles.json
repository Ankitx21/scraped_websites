        "body": "Several weeks after being targeted with copyright infringement lawsuits, AI music startups Suno and Udio have now accused the record labels that filed them of attempting to stifle competition within the music industry. Both companies admitted to training their music-generating AI models on copyrighted materials in separate legal filings, arguing that doing so is lawful under fair-use doctrine. The lawsuits against Suno and Udio were raised in June by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), a group representing major record labels like Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Records. Both cases accuse Suno and Udio of committing \u201ccopyright infringement involving unlicensed copying of sound recordings on a massive scale.\u201d The RIAA is seeking damages of up to $150,000 for every work infringed. Udio\u2019s and Suno\u2019s AI music generation tools allow users to produce songs by typing in written descriptions. According to the RIAA, some of these tracks contain vocals that sound identical to those by famous artists like Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson, and ABBA. In May, Suno said that its music generator had been used 12 million times since it was rolled out in December 2023.  In their responses, both Suno and Udio say the lawsuits highlight the music industry\u2019s opposition to competition. \u201cHelping people generate new artistic expression is what copyright law is designed to encourage, not prohibit,\u201d Udio wrote in its filing. \u201cUnder longstanding doctrine, what Udio has done \u2014 use existing sound recordings as data to mine and analyze for the purpose of identifying patterns in the sounds of various musical styles, all to enable people to make their own new creations \u2014 is a quintessential \u2018fair use\u2019 under copyright law.\u201d In a blog post accompanying its own filing, Suno said that major record labels had misconceptions about how its AI music tools work, likening its model training to \u201ca kid learning to write new rock songs by listening religiously to rock music\u201d as opposed to just copying and repeating copyrighted tracks. Suno also admitted to training its model on online music, noting that other AI providers like OpenAI, Google, and Apple also source their training data from the open internet. \u201cMuch of the open internet indeed contains copyrighted materials, and some of it is owned by major record labels,\u201d Suno said in the blog. \u201dLearning is not infringing. It never has been, and it is not now.\u201d Plenty of other AI companies have attempted to use fair-use doctrine to defend against their own copyright infringement lawsuits. In June, Microsoft AI boss Mustafa Suleyman incorrectly claimed that anything published on the open web becomes \u201cfreeware\u201d that anyone can freely copy and use. In a statement to Music Ally responding to Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s filings, the RIAA said that the companies failed to obtain appropriate consent to use copyrighted works before bringing their tools to market, unlike competing services like YouTube. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing fair about stealing an artist\u2019s life\u2019s work, extracting its core value, and repackaging it to compete directly with the originals,\u201d said the RIAA. \u201cTheir vision of the \u2018future of music\u2019 is apparently one in which fans will no longer enjoy music by their favorite artists because those artists can no longer earn a living.\u201d"

        "body": "The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly launched two separate probes into Nvidia regarding antitrust concerns about the computing giant\u2019s AI-focused business dealings. The first investigation, reported by Politico, will see the DOJ examine Nvidia\u2019s buyout of Run:ai, while the second, as reported by The Information, will assess if Nvidia abused its dominance in AI chips to discourage customers from using competing products. In April, Nvidia reportedly spent $700 million to acquire Run:ai, the Israeli startup specializing in GPU management software. While specific concerns surrounding the Run:ai purchase haven\u2019t been disclosed, both US and international regulators have closely scrutinized big tech acquisitions of late over issues like anticompetitive business practices and market monopolies. AI acquisitions have been of particular interest, with a joint statement issued by major US, EU, and UK regulators in July pledging to \u201csafeguard against tactics that would undermine fair competition or lead to unfair or deceptive practices in the AI ecosystem.\u201d The second investigation being launched by the DOJ comes in response to complaints from competitors. It will examine whether Nvidia abused its market dominance to pressure cloud providers into buying its products. The probe will also investigate claims that Nvidia overcharges its customers for networking equipment if they opt to purchase AI chips from rival companies like AMD and Intel.  \u201cWe compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making Nvidia openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,\u201d Nvidia spokesperson Mylene Mangalindan said in a statement to Politico. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to support aspiring innovators in every industry and market and are happy to provide any information regulators need.\u201d Nvidia is estimated to control between 70 percent and 95 percent of the market for chips needed to train AI models. Nvidia\u2019s dominance has drawn ire from other global regulators, with Reuters reporting last month that the company may face French antitrust charges for alleged anti-competitive practices. In June, Nvidia briefly overtook Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company, a feat largely propelled by booming demand for AI technology."

        "body": "It\u2019s harsh, but it was my exact first thought as well. While there are stylistic differences, it\u2019s painfully obvious that Samsung made a list of everything the Apple Watch Ultra had that the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro \u2014 Samsung\u2019s first attempt at a more rugged smartwatch \u2014 didn\u2019t. It then went down the list, ticking off each feature one by one. By and large, that was a successful strategy. This is a great Android smartwatch. Arguably, it\u2019s the best Android smartwatch. It just doesn\u2019t feel good. More specifically, the Ultra\u2019s successes don\u2019t always feel earned. Samsung smartwatches have always had their own unique flair (usually in the form of a physical rotating bezel, which is sadly missing here). Yes, there were some Samsung-y quirks, but it gave the watches character.\u00a0 Some of that quintessential Samsung-ness is still there. But it\u2019s also undeniable that Samsung overhauled its wearable strategy to be the Apple of Android. My nerdy lil\u2019 heart isn\u2019t broken over it. But it does sting. Compare that to what they do have in common: I could go on because there are even more similar features \u2014 like backtracking for hikes, racing past routes for runners, and functional threshold power for cyclists \u2014 but these are the major ones.\u00a0 It\u2019s understandable why Samsung has followed this route. The Apple Watch Ultra has been successful in a way that the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro has not. And as much as I hate to say it, I can\u2019t say it was a bad idea. All of these additions and upgrades add up to a powerful and capable Android smartwatch. Overall performance is snappy, battery life is good once you finish calibrating (more on that later), and there\u2019s great synergy if you use it with the new Galaxy Ring. I could end the review right now with \u201cthis is the Apple Watch Ultra for Android,\u201d and you\u2019d probably have a decent understanding of the Galaxy Watch Ultra\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that when Apple does it better, it takes some of the shine from Samsung\u2019s version. For instance, it\u2019s easier to sync a custom hiking route onto Apple\u2019s Ultra via the Maps app\u00a0than it is to download a .GPX file from a separate app into the Samsung Health app on your phone. Apple\u2019s Ultra has a native depth app and can be used as a dive computer. You can safely take Samsung\u2019s Ultra for a plunge, but there are no equivalent scuba diving capabilities. Programming and using the Action Button is a bit more intuitive than the Quick Button. If I step into a dark closet, the Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s night mode kicks on automatically. Auto night mode on the Galaxy Watch Ultra seems to be based on the actual time.\u00a0 But comparison is the thief of joy. Instead, allow me to gripe about one of the Galaxy Watch Ultra\u2019s more distinct features: its polarizing squircle design.\u00a0 But after a few weeks of wear, I wish Samsung had just picked a rectangular display or a circular one instead of splitting the difference. Retaining the circular design would\u2019ve kept it more visually distinct from Apple and, let\u2019s face it, less ugly. (Though, there is an element of color preference here. I find the white titanium version to be much more fetching than the silver or my Halloween-y review unit. The black case is fine, but the strap is so orange.) Aside from aesthetic sensibilities, Samsung\u2019s 47mm Ultra is chunkier on the wrist than Apple\u2019s 49mm Ultra. That\u2019s because Samsung\u2019s square case looks more squat on the wrist, even if the dimensions are quite similar. It also wasn\u2019t quite as comfy for my petite wrists. The gap between the strap and my wrist was so wide, I could stuff exactly three pens or chopsticks into that space. The added chunkiness also made it difficult to find a good fit. Either I strapped the watch on way too tight, leaving marks on my arm, or it was too loose and would slide up and down my wrist. The Ultra sports a 590mAh battery, which is the same as the Pro. However, software updates between 2022 and 2024 \u2014 and a new exercise power-saving mode \u2014 help extend the Ultra\u2019s battery life. Battery life depends heavily on individual usage, but in testing, I got roughly 70 hours on a single charge with heavy GPS usage and power-guzzling features like the always-on display enabled. If I enabled power-saving mode once I hit 15 percent battery, I could stretch it to about 76 hours. (Note: Samsung watches take a few charge cycles to calibrate and learn your usage patterns. The first few days, I got a dismal 36\u201348 hours on a single charge.) I never quite hit Samsung\u2019s 100-hour estimate, but it\u2019s still a marked improvement over the 50\u201360 hours I got with the Pro.\u00a0 This is true multiday battery life, though it still falls short of other multisport watches for real outdoorsy types. When I tracked a 3.5-hour hike in a remote area with no cell reception, the Galaxy Watch Ultra lost 22 percent battery, whereas my year-old Ultra 2 lost about 34 percent. While you might get away with leaving the charger at home for a one- or two-day trip, but you\u2019re rolling the dice for anything longer. Double pinch isn\u2019t a new feature for Samsung watches \u2014 it\u2019s been around for a while. It\u2019s just more front and center now. Unlike Apple\u2019s version, it\u2019s not contextual, meaning it\u2019s limited to mostly dismissing alerts, accepting calls, and controlling your phone\u2019s camera. But putting those limitations in place ironically makes it more clear-cut for daily use. There are a few other gestures you can use, which expands your hands-free options. For instance, I programmed the knock knock gesture to open the Camera Controller app and then used double pinch to snap selfies. That\u2019s just neat. I wrote more about the Energy Score metric in my Galaxy Ring review, but the gist is that it\u2019s broadly accurate with some hit-or-miss AI-generated advice. The same is true for the AI-generated Wellness Tips. For example, the other morning, I got two tips that told me that I both was and wasn\u2019t sticking to my sleep schedule.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the AGEs index metric is baffling. While you sleep, the watch measures for bodily compounds that accumulate when \u201cprotein and fat molecules are oxidized by sugar molecules.\u201d Supposedly, that tells you how well you\u2019re metabolically aging, but Samsung has been vague about how this actually works, the value of even having this data, and what you\u2019re supposed to do with it. You\u2019re graded on a spectrum from low to high \u2014 it told me I\u2019m in the middle. To improve my score, the app advises me to eat healthy, exercise, and prioritize sleep to improve my AGEs index \u2014 which I\u2019m already doing\u00a0\u2014 while other parts of the app tell me to stop working out so hard. Is this a real thing? Maybe in the research field, but in a consumer smartwatch, this is little more than a gimmick. The new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature is relatively straightforward, but unfortunately, I found it difficult to use. The feature requires you to wear the watch for two nights while you sleep to detect disturbances based on blood oxygen levels. I had a hard time getting valid readings, partly because the Ultra\u2019s size made it hard to get a snug fit. Eventually, I was correctly told I don\u2019t have sleep apnea. The caveat is this feature is not a medical diagnostic tool and may not catch every instance of obstructed breathing \u2014 so take from that what you will. Like the EKG feature, it also requires you to have a Galaxy phone. Honestly, the best fitness update was the addition of dual-frequency GPS. Compared to the Galaxy Watch 7, the Ultra was much more accurate at recording the distance of my runs. I hiked a 4.99-mile route with heavy tree cover, and the Ultra recorded a spot-on 4.99 miles, while my Apple Watch Ultra 2 logged a negligible difference of 5.03 miles.\u00a0 However, I fear that in copying Apple so closely, Samsung will eventually stop marching to its own quirky beat. Because it\u2019s not just this watch \u2014 the whole Galaxy Watch lineup now mirrors Apple. There\u2019s a budget Galaxy Watch FE to match the Apple Watch SE, a Galaxy Watch 7 sits where the Apple Watch Series 9 does, and at the top, there\u2019s the Galaxy Watch Ultra. Samsung\u2019s signature physical rotating bezel is now limited to last year\u2019s Galaxy Watch 6 Classic \u2014 which wasn\u2019t updated this year. It\u2019s unclear if it\u2019ll get a refresh down the road. This truly was a bittersweet review to write. I can\u2019t deny the Galaxy Watch Ultra fills a void for Android users who want a smarter Garmin alternative. (For a reasonable price, too.) I can\u2019t fault Samsung for trying something different now that it has a rival in the Pixel Watch. After coasting with last year\u2019s watches, it had to do something to regain momentum. I just never thought it would do it by making an Apple Watch.\u00a0 Photography by Victoria Song / The Verge Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. To use the Galaxy Watch Ultra, you must pair it with an Android phone. That includes whatever terms of service or privacy policies that phone requires. As for Samsung and Wear OS 5, you\u2019ll have five mandatory agreements. There are also several optional permissions for features that may use voice, location, or camera. If you download a third-party app, like Strava or Calm, you\u2019ll have to agree to their terms and share your health data with them as well. You may also have to agree to the Samsung Pay terms of service and privacy policies if you opt to use that service. You may also have to grant additional permissions if you choose to download the Samsung Health Monitor for EKG readings. Final tally: six mandatory agreements and numerous optional permissions and agreements."

But there\u2019s one piece of feedback we\u2019ve gotten that I really wanted to spend some time on: how the lightning-fast explosion of AI tools affects the climate.  After all, to run AI at scale, we need to build a lot of data centers and pack them full of power-hungry GPUs. That takes a lot of energy, and whether using all that juice is worth it comes up frequently when we talk about AI. It\u2019s both a matter of practical concern \u2014 \u201ccan our aging grid support all of this?\u201d \u2014 and a moral objection \u2014 \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t build these systems because they\u2019ll wreck the planet.\u201d  What\u2019s particularly complicated is that big tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have spent the last few years working with governments around the world to set ambitious goals around sustainable energy usage so that we might slow the rate of climate change to simply \u201cbad\u201d instead of \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d But now, with AI, all of those companies are blowing past their emissions targets and are actually getting worse over time. That\u2019s not great. But putting a bunch of computers in a data center and running them at full tilt is how basically everything works now. If you have a moral objection to AI based on climate concerns, you might have a moral objection to TikTok and YouTube as well, which are constantly ingesting and encoding millions of hours of video. You might have a moral objection to video games, which run both on power-hungry GPUs in people\u2019s homes and often require intense data center workloads for online multiplayer. And I\u2019ll take a guess, but I feel pretty certain anyone with climate concerns about AI has a pretty harsh assessment of crypto, too. I mean, think about it this way: the Nvidia H100, which is the gold standard for AI GPUs, is pretty similar to the gaming-focused Nvidia RTX 4090 in terms of power draw. What framework should we use to evaluate the climate impact of those cards and how we feel about how they\u2019re used? It\u2019s messy and complicated, and there are a bunch of apparent contradictions along the way. So it\u2019s perfect for Decoder. To help sort it out, I\u2019ve invited Verge senior science reporter Justine Calma on the show to see if we can untangle this knot. Let us know how we did. "

This time, net neutrality will be blocked until the court says otherwise after reviewing the petitions from broadband providers who opposed the rule. Those internet service providers (ISPs) successfully showed they would likely succeed on the merits of their challenge, the panel of judges wrote. \u201cThe American public wants an internet that is fast, open, and fair,\u201d Federal Communications Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement on the stay. \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the Sixth Circuit is a setback but we will not give up the fight for net neutrality.\u201d The FCC voted to restore net neutrality rules earlier this year, after years of back and forth on the rule. Net neutrality is the concept that ISPs shouldn\u2019t discriminate against different websites by blocking or throttling speeds or access. The controversial part of the policy is the mechanism by which the FCC has tried to enforce these rules: by reclassifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. ISPs have resisted this reclassification in large part because they say it could lead to even greater government control over their businesses that they say would stifle innovation. For example, they say the classification could be used to impose price regulations, though the FCC has said it\u2019s not planning on it. While restoring net neutrality was always going to be contentious, its fate looked even bleaker after the Supreme Court gutted Chevron deference, a legal standard where courts deferred to expert agencies in many cases about regulation. Experts predicted net neutrality would be ripe for disruption after Chevron\u2019s downfall, and the judges\u2019 opinion notes that prior courts that upheld net neutrality relied on Chevron.  In a concurring opinion, Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton writes that the FCC\u2019s flip-flopping on net neutrality between administrations makes it difficult to even apply the lower standard of Skidmore deference, thought to potentially be a fallback now that agencies can no longer rely on Chevron deference. Citing Skidmore, Sutton writes, \u201cAn agency\u2019s power to persuade turns on the thoroughness of its reasoning, its technical expertise, and its \u2018consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,\u2019\u201d especially those contemporaneous with the statute\u2019s enactment,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe problem is, we do not know which group of experts to respect.\u201d  He adds, \u201cThe consistency query makes matters worse. The Commission\u2019s \u2018intention to reverse course for yet a fourth time\u2019 suggests that its reasoning has more to do with changing presidential administrations than with arriving at the true and durable \u2018meaning of the law.\u2019\u201d"

        "body": "In iOS 18\u2019s latest developer preview, Siri gets a glow-up. Like, the whole phone actually glows around the edges when you invoke Siri. A splash screen reintroduces you to the virtual assistant once you enable Apple Intelligence, an early version of which is now available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max in a developer beta. You\u2019ll know Siri is listening when the edges of the screen glow, making it pretty obvious that something different is going on. The big Siri AI update is still months away. This version comes with meaningful improvements to language understanding, but future updates will add features like awareness of what\u2019s on your screen and the ability to take action on your behalf. Meanwhile, the rest of the Apple Intelligence feature set previewed in this update feels like a party waiting for the guest of honor. That said, Siri\u2019s improvements in this update are useful. Tapping the bottom of the screen twice will bring up a new way to interact with the assistant: through text. It\u2019s also much better at parsing natural language, waiting more patiently through hesitations and \u201cum\u201ds as I stumble through questions. It also understands when I\u2019m asking a follow-up question. Outside of Siri, it\u2019s kind of an Easter egg hunt finding bits of Apple Intelligence sprinkled throughout the OS. They\u2019re in the mail app, with a summarize button at the top of each email now. And anywhere you can type and highlight text, you\u2019ll find a new option called \u201cwriting tools\u201d with AI proofreading, writing suggestions, and summaries.  \u201cHelp me write something\u201d is pretty standard fare for generative AI these days, and Apple Intelligence does it as well as anyone else. You can have it make your text more friendly, professional, or concise. You can also create summaries of text or synthesize it into bulleted lists of key points or a table.  I\u2019m finding these tools most useful in the Notes app, where you can now add voice recordings. In iOS 18, voice recordings finally come with automatic transcriptions, which is not an Apple Intelligence feature since it also works on my iPhone 13 Mini. But Apple Intelligence will let you turn a recording transcript into a summary or a checklist. This is helpful if you want to just free-associate while recording a memo and list a bunch of things you need to pack for an upcoming trip; Apple Intelligence turns it into a list that actually makes sense.  These writing tools are tucked out of the way, and if you weren\u2019t looking for them, you might miss them entirely. The more obvious new AI features are in the mail app. Apple Intelligence surfaces what it deems to be important emails in a card that sits above the rest of your inbox marked as priority. Below that, emails show a brief summary in place of the first line or two of text that you\u2019d normally see.  There\u2019s something charming about AI\u2019s sincere attempt to summarize promotional emails, trying to helpfully pull out bits of detail like \u201cBackpacks and lunch boxes ship FREE\u201d and \u201cOrganic white nectarines are sweet and juicy, in season now.\u201d But the descriptions in my inbox were accurate \u2014 helpful in a few instances and harmless at worst. And the emails it gave priority status to were genuinely important, which is promising. The search tool in the Photos app now uses AI to understand more complicated requests. You can ask for pictures of a particular person wearing glasses or all the food you ate in Iceland, all in natural language.  It\u2019s very good. Results come back fast and are generally reliable. It found the photo I had in mind of my kid wearing a pair of goofy glasses, though it also surfaced photos in which he appeared and someone else was wearing some glasses. Still, I think it\u2019s bound to be a feature that people immediately get used to and don\u2019t think twice about using \u2014 intuitive and obviously useful. But despite the light show, Siri is about the same as ever. It mostly remains a \u201clet me Google that for you\u201d machine. The most significant updates are still to come in future updates when Siri will gain awareness of what\u2019s on your screen and will be able to take action in apps for you. In theory, you\u2019ll be able to have Siri grab information from messages and turn them into calendar events or retrieve information from email without you having to go digging through your inbox.  That\u2019s the stuff I\u2019m most excited about, and all of the pieces of Apple Intelligence available so far could be the building blocks of a better Siri. Apple\u2019s AI is capable of understanding the contents of an email or a photo. Likewise, Siri is better at understanding how humans talk. In order for Apple Intelligence to prove itself, Siri needs to connect the dots."

        "body": "Want to get into PC gaming and feel like you don\u2019t have enough pricey subscriptions in your life? Desktop PC builder and retailer NZXT can ship you a whole gaming rig for as little as $59 per month \u2014 as long as you provide your own mouse, keyboard, and monitor. The Flex subscription program has been available for at least several months, based on NZXT\u2019s posts, and the pricing and specs of the machines listed have changed over time. Now, it\u2019s updating its three-tiered approach to PC renting with new specs, with its base Player: One entry-level sub running $59 per month for a tower running an Intel Core i5 14400F and Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU. Stepping up to the mid-tier Player: Two costs $119 per month for an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X CPU and RTX 4070 Super GPU, and the top-tier Player: Three package costs $169 per month with an Intel Core i7 13700KF and RTX 4070 Ti Super.  All three tiers also require a $50 \u201csetup and shipping fee\u201d that will include the return label if you decide to cancel your subscription. The NZXT site indicates that subscribers can expect to have a new or like-new Flex PC delivered within three to five days on a month-to-month term that\u2019s free to cancel anytime. Customers will also have access to free replacements with 24/7 customer support if something should go wrong and guaranteed hardware upgrades every two years. Two years is a pretty long period, and even with the cheapest Player: One model, you\u2019ll have spent $1,416 to use that 4060 through 2026 (though, there should be a free upgrade at some point in that timeline). The Player: Three tier with 4070 Ti Super would cost $4,056 to rent for two years.  That\u2019s the kind of money you could potentially spend to build your own 4090-level desktop that\u2019s much more capable for 4K gaming. Woof. We\u2019ve reached out to NZXT for clarification on what the full specs are for each updated tier (including RAM and storage) and if subscribers have any incentives like rent-to-own pricing if they can buy their rented Flex computer."

        "body": "Google\u2019s earlier-than-expected Pixel hardware event is just around the corner \u2014 it\u2019s scheduled for Tuesday, August 13th. Thanks to the relentless flow of leaks that have emerged over the past few weeks, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect. Google has already confirmed that it\u2019s launching the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but the company may have some other surprises in store, including the Buds Pro 2 and maybe even the Pixel Watch 3. Here\u2019s a roundup of everything we know so far. Alongside the Pixel 9, Google is expected to release the Pixel Pro in two sizes: a larger 6.8-inch model and a smaller 6.3-inch variant. It\u2019ll be the first time the Pro features are available in two different sizes, with the telephoto camera previously being reserved only for the larger phone model. As shown in the image shared by Google itself (and many, many leaks), the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro will also come with some distinct design changes. Both the Pro and standard models are getting flatter edges and a rounded camera module that protrudes from the back of the device. A leaked spec sheet from OnLeaks suggests that the Pixel 9 Pro models will come with a G4 Tensor chip (which is expected to come with slight upgrades) and 16GB of RAM. Meanwhile, the base Pixel 9 is expected to have the same chip with a 6.3-inch display and 12GB of RAM.  Both phones could start with 128GB of storage, with options going up to 1TB on the Pro model. The cameras on both devices will likely get some updates as well, with the leaked spec sheet showing the Pixel 9 with a 10.5MP selfie camera, a 50-megapixel main camera, and a 48MP ultrawide lens. The leak also indicates that the Pixel 9 Pro will have a 42MP selfie camera and three cameras on the rear, including a 50MP main camera, 48MP ultrawide lens, and 48MP telephoto camera. Another rumored change coming to the Pixel 9 lineup is the addition of Samsung\u2019s Exynos 5400 modem, potentially powering a satellite SOS feature similar to newer iPhones. Additionally, a report from Android Authority suggests Google may add an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor to the Pixel 9 lineup, which could hopefully improve some of the issues users have been having with the existing optical under-display sensor.  The Pixel 9 is expected to come in obsidian, porcelain, rose, and green, while the Pro model is rumored to come in charcoal, porcelain, rose, and hazel. Those three phones aren\u2019t the only ones Google is planning to release this summer. It\u2019s also getting ready to release its next-gen foldable, now called the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. When compared to last year\u2019s device, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold appears to be taller and slimmer. That design change is also reflected in the squircle-shaped camera housing on the rear of the device, which now comes with two sets of cameras. In terms of specs, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is rumored to come with a 6.3-inch cover display and an 8-inch inner screen. That\u2019s larger than the original Pixel Fold\u2019s 5.8-inch outer display and 7.6-inch inner display. The leaked specs sheet indicates that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with the same G4 Tensor chip as the other devices in the lineup, as well as 16GB of RAM. It may also have a 10MP front-facing camera, with a 48MP main camera, a 10.5MP ultrawide lens, and a 10.8MP telephoto sensor on the back of the phone. The Pixel Fold is expected to be available in porcelain and obsidian. With Samsung and now Apple making an effort to bring AI to their phones, it\u2019s no surprise to see Google doing the same. A set of leaked marketing materials from OnLeaks hints, among other features, at a new Pixel Screenshots feature that \u201chelps you save info that you want to remember later \u2014 like events, places and more.\u201d  That tracks with a previous leak from Android Police, which suggests that the feature can \u201csave and process helpful details\u201d from your screenshots, letting you search through them. It sounds a bit like Microsoft\u2019s controversial Recall feature but appears to only work on the screenshots you take manually, rather than scanning your entire device. The marketing materials also show an integration with Google\u2019s AI chatbot Gemini, along with Circle to Search.  A leaked Pixel 9 ad posted by Android Headlines (it has since been taken down) gave us a glimpse at a feature called \u201cAdd Me,\u201d which appears to use AI to put someone in a photo when they weren\u2019t originally there. It looks like Google is planning to update its Magic Editor tool, too, allowing you to replace the background of an image based on a prompt. It\u2019s already been two years since the launch of the original Pixel Buds Pro, and now it looks like Google is planning to give them a refresh. Leaked images from OnLeaks show the Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a small wing tip that sticks out from the side of each bud \u2014 sort of like a smaller version of the \u201cstabilizer arc\u201d on the original Pixel Buds. Other small changes include larger grills that match the colors of the bud, as well as a charging case that appears to come with a small speaker (maybe to emit a noise when using Google\u2019s Find My feature?). The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are expected to come in gray, white, green, and pink. We may have a good idea of what the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will look like, but we don\u2019t know much about the specs. A regulatory listing spotted earlier this year suggests the case may come with a larger 650mAh battery. Other than that, we can likely expect the Pixel Buds Pro 2 to feature the same active noise cancellation and multipoint features as their predecessor. So far, we\u2019ve only seen renders of the Pixel Watch 3 that show a device with a slightly chunkier design. Unlike its predecessor, the Pixel Watch 3 is expected to come in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. The 41mm version is rumored to come with a 10 percent larger screen than its similarly sized predecessor, thanks to thinner bezels. Recent leaks also suggest both Pixel Watch 3 models will get a brighter 2,000-nit display and an ultra wideband chip that could make location tracking more accurate. The 41mm watch is also rumored to come with a slightly bigger 310mAh battery and 20 percent faster charging than the Pixel Watch 2.  Both sizes could offer up to 24 hours of battery life with always-on display enabled or up to 36 hours with a new Battery Saver mode, according to leaked marketing materials shared by Android Headlines. The materials also hint at support for offline Google Maps, new camera controls when connecting to a Pixel phone, and the ability to view your Nest Cam and Nest Doorbell\u2019s live feeds from your watch. Unfortunately, you may not be able to use your current Pixel Watch 2 bands with the larger 45mm device. A report suggests that the 45mm version has an \u201caltered\u201d band connection that could make it incompatible with smaller bands. The 45mm Pixel Watch 3 may not get as many band options as the 41mm version, either, according to Android Headlines. It may seem like we already know all we know about Google\u2019s upcoming hardware event, but the company may still surprise us. For one, there\u2019s a possibility that we may get a look at the new \u201cGoogle TV Streamer,\u201d which 9to5Google published leaked images of in July. It looks way different than the Chromecast, but we still don\u2019t have any details on specs. That\u2019s all we know for now, but there\u2019s still time between now and Google\u2019s August 13th event, which means there\u2019s still a chance for more leaks. Update, July 31st: Added more rumored specs for the Pixel 9."

        "body": "But this is still a transitional era. While we\u2019re encouraged by the stronger third-party app options, the market is still fragmented. Wear OS 4 is here for Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watches and both versions of the Pixel Watch \u2014 and now, the OnePlus Watch 2. Wear OS 5 is here. However, the larger ecosystem is still catching up. Some features, like Google Assistant, are not yet available on certain Wear OS 3 smartwatches, and Wear OS 4 still isn\u2019t widely available. Even so, the Android wearable ecosystem is barreling ahead. Samsung just launched the Galaxy Watch FE, Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra. Later this month, we\u2019re also expecting to see a new Pixel Watch 3. Android smartwatches have long been foiled by outdated processors. Is the chip under the hood powerful enough to run Wear OS / proprietary RTOS smoothly? Does a watch work better within one company\u2019s product ecosystem versus another? Will you have to buy a new watch if you switch phones? These days, most wearables are capable fitness trackers. However, they\u2019re not all capable of controlling your smart home, contactless payments, or interacting with digital assistants. Is this device likely to last you a while, or will you need to upgrade sooner than you\u2019d like? How communicative is the OEM about forthcoming changes? Can you get through the day without reaching for a charger? If not, does it support quick charging? If you\u2019d rather wait until Wear OS settles down a bit, there are platform-agnostic smartwatches and fitness watches you can buy in the meantime. Otherwise, you\u2019ll want to be aware of the chip and Wear OS version powering your watch. Mobvoi, for instance, only just started rolling out Wear OS 3 to its eligible Wear OS 2 watches. Speaking of Mobvoi, its TicWatch Pro 5 was the first to sport the new Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus in the US, and while it\u2019s a great watch, you may want to wait until there are more W5 Plus watches to choose from. That said, the base W5 chip is also pretty good. The Pixel Watch 2 and OnePlus Watch 2 both sport the W5 and have notably better performance and battery life.  So long as you keep the aforementioned caveats in mind, Android users have more smartwatch options than ever before. I\u2019ve rounded up my top picks, but if none of these is the right fit, you can always check out our fitness tracker guide.\u00a0 Sizes:\u00a043mm, 47mm /\u00a0Weight:\u00a077g, 85g /\u00a0Battery life:\u00a0Up to 30 hours with AOD, 40 without AOD /\u00a0Display type:\u00a0Always-on OLED /\u00a0GPS:\u00a0Built-in GPS /\u00a0Connectivity:\u00a0LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /\u00a0Water resistance:\u00a0Up to 50 meters, IP68 /\u00a0Music storage:\u00a016GB If you have a Samsung phone, you\u2019ll get the most mileage out of a Samsung smartwatch. And of the four watches Samsung has in its current lineup, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. Although Samsung just released the Galaxy Watch 7, there wasn\u2019t a refresh for the Classic. That means you ought to be seeing some good deals for the Classic soon, if not already. It\u2019s not often that I recommend a last-gen device, but such is my deep love for the physical rotating bezel. But, if you want the latest and greatest, the Galaxy Watch 7 offers an upgraded 3nm Exynos W1000 chip and a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor. It\u2019s a marginal improvement over last year\u2019s models, but I don\u2019t feel like Samsung introduced anything this year that requires having them. It also has Wear OS 5 and One UI 6 Watch, but that\u2019ll eventually make its way back to the older watches, too. Mostly, I recommend the 7 if you prefer a smaller size, don\u2019t care about the rotating bezel, and want something a smidge more futureproof.  The Classic\u2019s rotating bezel is 15 percent thinner than the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The updated design is sleeker than its predecessor, and the larger display is easier on the eyes and is only slightly bigger at 43mm and 47mm. I have small wrists, but the 47mm was still quite comfortable for everyday wear. It\u2019s launching with Wear OS 4, which adds extended battery life, and \u2014 finally \u2014 cloud backups. One UI 5 Watch also adds some minor health and sleep tracking improvements, but this will eventually make its way to older models. While I prefer the Classic, the base Watch 6 model may be the better option if you want a smaller, lighter, sleeker, and cheaper smartwatch. For more outdoorsy folks, the $649.99 Galaxy Watch Ultra might be the more sensible choice. Of all Samsung\u2019s watches, it has the best battery life, lasting around three days in our testing. (Though, we never got the full 100-hour estimated battery life.) It\u2019s got dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, increased durability, 10ATM of water resistance, and a Quick Button, which acts as a customizable shortcut button. It\u2019s basically an Apple Watch Ultra for Android.  Meanwhile, if you\u2019re on a budget, there\u2019s the new $199.99 Galaxy Watch FE, which is essentially a rebadged Galaxy Watch 4. The Samsung Health app also delivers a good overall fitness tracking experience, especially since you can enable turn-by-turn navigation for hiking and cycling activities. We weren\u2019t too impressed with nightly SpO2 readings, but Samsung\u2019s overall sleep tracking continues to improve. You also get built-in GPS, body composition analysis, irregular heart rate notifications, fall detection, emergency SOS features, and EKGs.\u00a0Most recently, Samsung\u2019s added a new Energy score, AI-powered wellness insights, FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, and a confusing AGEs Index metric for metabolic health. While the Energy score is broadly accurate, I found the AI-generated features to be hit or miss and the AGEs Index to be more gimmicky than useful. The latter feature is also limited to the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra.  We don\u2019t necessarily recommend the Galaxy Watches if you don\u2019t have a Samsung phone. EKGs and sleep apnea detection require the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is limited to Samsung phones. You can work around it, but all Samsung watches work best with other Samsung devices. Sizes:\u00a041mm /\u00a0Weight:\u00a031g /\u00a0Battery life:\u00a0Roughly 24 hours with AOD enabled /\u00a0Display type:\u00a0Always-on OLED /\u00a0GPS:\u00a0Built-in GPS\u00a0/\u00a0Connectivity:\u00a0LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Safety Signal with Fitbit Premium /\u00a0Water resistance:\u00a05ATM /\u00a0Music storage:\u00a032GB The $349.99 Google Pixel Watch 2 is a significant improvement over the original. The Galaxy Watch 6 lineup will still get you a more polished overall experience, but the Pixel Watch 2 is the better choice for Android users who aren\u2019t on a Samsung smartphone. That\u2019s because of ecosystems. Some features of Samsung\u2019s watches only work with Samsung phones. Broadly speaking, the Pixel Watch doesn\u2019t care what Android phone you have; you\u2019ll get the same experience regardless. That said, its call screening feature will only work if you pair it with a Tensor-equipped Pixel phone. It\u2019s a little disappointing, but compared to Samsung, the Pixel Watch 2 doesn\u2019t gatekeep health features based on what phone you have. It\u2019s also always going to have the latest updates to Google services like Google Maps, Google Wallet, YouTube Music, and Google Assistant because, well, it\u2019s Google\u2019s smartwatch. With the Pixel Watch 2, Google also added Calendar and Gmail to its list of supported apps. Speaking of which, buying the Pixel Watch 2 will also get you a six-month trial of Fitbit Premium and a one-month trial of YouTube Music.\u00a0 The most important upgrade from last year is that the battery reliably lasts 24 hours with the always-on display enabled. Some of this is due to the more power-efficient Wear OS 4 and a new Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 processor. (It also means zippier performance overall.) It\u2019s also switched to a pin-charging system, which translates to much faster charging. You can get about 50 percent in 30 minutes, and a full charge takes about 75 minutes. Because of a firmware update, the original Pixel Watch now charges more slowly \u2014 so the difference is extra noticeable.  Compared to last year, Google has also done a better job this year of integrating Fitbit\u2019s health and fitness features. The Pixel Watch 2 now has a multipath sensor that enables 40 percent more accurate heart rate tracking for vigorous exercises. Plus, you can utilize heart rate zone and pace training \u2014 features other fitness smartwatches have had for a long time. The exercise views are also easier to read. It also now has a skin temperature sensor and the Fitbit Sense 2\u2019s continuous electrodermal activity sensor (cEDA). This means the Pixel Watch 2 is now capable of proactive stress tracking. When signs of physiological stress are detected, you\u2019ll be prompted to reflect on your mood, take a walk, or do a breathing exercise. It\u2019s imperfect, but it\u2019s one of the best implementations of mindfulness features we\u2019ve seen thus far.  Google has also introduced new personal safety features. Safety Check is a proactive timer that will send your location to loved ones if you\u2019re in a pickle. You set an activity (i.e., taking public transportation or walking alone) and a timer duration. If you don\u2019t check in when the timer goes off, your location will automatically be shared with your emergency contacts. Another neat feature is Safety Signal. If you get an LTE watch and have a Fitbit Premium subscription, you don\u2019t need an active LTE plan in order to utilize emergency services. Speaking of safety, Google also added crash detection in a recent update and improved fall detection for bicycles.  One thing to be mindful of is durability. While the domed display is beautiful, we cracked the screen on the original Pixel Watch and got deep scratches on the Pixel Watch 2. Google doesn\u2019t offer any repair options, but with the Pixel Watch 2, it has started offering its Preferred Care extended warranty, so you have more replacement options should something happen. It\u2019s not ideal since it\u2019s limited to the US and Canada, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction. We\u2019re expecting to see a new Pixel Watch 3 announced on August 13th at the Made by Google event. That means you might start seeing Pixel Watch 2 discounts in the next few weeks. If you\u2019re hoping for a bigger size, you may want to hold off, as rumor has it we could be seeing a Pixel Watch 3 XL.  Sizes:\u00a047mm w/22mm straps /\u00a0Weight:\u00a049g case, 80g w/ strap /\u00a0Battery life:\u00a0Up to 100 hours in smart mode, 48 with AOD on, and 12 days in power-saving mode /\u00a0Display type:\u00a0OLED touchscreen /\u00a0GPS:\u00a0Dual-frequency GPS, Beidou, GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, QZSS /\u00a0Connectivity:\u00a0Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /\u00a0Water resistance:\u00a05ATM /\u00a0Music storage:\u00a032GB The $299.99 OnePlus Watch 2 is what a glow-up looks like. While the original OnePlus Watch was horrible, this watch helps fill the void that Fossil left when it said it was pulling out of Android smartwatches \u2014 namely, a viable alternative to Google and Samsung. The 47mm case is big for petite wrists, and unfortunately, it only comes in one size, but it\u2019s made of durable stainless steel and sapphire crystal. Plus, it houses a 500mAh battery. That, plus a dual-chip architecture and novel dual OS system, results in super long battery life. How long a smartwatch lasts will of course depend on your individual usage, but I got nearly four days with normal use. That\u2019s incredible for a flagship. It also has Wear OS 4, making it the only third-party Wear OS watch running the latest software. It has Google Assistant from the get-go \u2014 a big achievement since that\u2019s been a problem with other third-party Android watches. Plus, you get access to the Google Play Store for a robust app ecosystem. On the fitness side of things, OnePlus added dual-frequency GPS. That\u2019s a plus if you\u2019re outdoorsy and frequent challenging GPS environments like dense forests or crowded cities.  The main things you\u2019re giving up are LTE connectivity and some features like EKGs, atrial fibrillation detection, native period tracking, and fall detection. The lack of cellular is a bummer, as it means you really should keep your phone on you when you\u2019re out and about. Still, the $300 price tag is a competitive one and may be worth the tradeoff given battery life.  Sizes:\u00a050mm w/24mm straps /\u00a0Weight:\u00a044.3g /\u00a0Battery life:\u00a0Up to 80 hours /\u00a0Display type:\u00a0OLED touchscreen and secondary ultra-low power display /\u00a0GPS:\u00a0GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, Beidou /\u00a0Connectivity:\u00a0Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /\u00a0Water resistance:\u00a05ATM /\u00a0Music storage:\u00a032GB Mobvoi\u2019s TicWatch lineup has its devoted fans for a reason: super long battery life. The $249.99 TicWatch Pro 5 is no exception. It\u2019s got an estimated 80 hours of battery life with standard use, a secondary ultra-low power display, and a massive (for a smartwatch you wear on your wrist, at least) 628mAh battery. I didn\u2019t quite get 80 hours in my testing, but I did get a solid 48-60 hours even with heavy GPS use. That outclasses most of the watches in this category (except the OnePluS Watch 2) and is useful for backpackers and endurance athletes. It might not hold a candle to a top-of-the-line Garmin, but it\u2019s also a smarter watch for a fraction of the price. Battery life aside, the Pro 5 is a good option for fitness-focused people who aren\u2019t keen on giving up smart capabilities for a Garmin or Polar. It\u2019s also more durable. This time around, Mobvoi has also added a digital crown so you don\u2019t have to worry about scrolling through menus with sweaty fingers. The flatter side button also reduces the risk of accidental presses.   The Pro 5 also has an ingenious method of displaying heart rate. When you lift up your arm, the backlight changes color depending on which heart rate zone you\u2019re in. That means you can instantly gauge whether to up the intensity or slow your roll. The Pro 5 also adds new training metrics, like VO2 Max and recovery time.  The TicWatch supports stress tracking, all-day blood oxygen monitoring, fatigue assessments, as well as atrial fibrillation and irregular heartbeat detection. For outdoorsy types, it also has access to multiple GNSS systems, and there\u2019s a new barometer and compass app, as well as a one-tap measurement app that gives you a quick look at five metrics (heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, respiratory rate, and overall heart health).  It\u2019s also pretty capable on the productivity front. You get contactless payments, access to the Play Store, notifications, and the ability to take calls. It\u2019s also the only Android smartwatch available in the US with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus chip, which is a plus in terms of futureproofing. The only major concerns are the 50mm case that may not suit smaller wrists and the lack of a digital assistant.  The good news is Mobvoi recently opened up applications for a Wear OS 4 beta program for this watch. It\u2019s not the wide upgrade rollout we perhaps hoped for, but it is a sign that Wear OS 4 is likely on the way.  Sizes:\u00a037mm with 18mm straps /\u00a0Weight:\u00a045g /\u00a0Battery life:\u00a0Up to 39 days /\u00a0Display type:\u00a0OLED display /\u00a0GPS:\u00a0Tethered GPS /\u00a0Connectivity:\u00a0Bluetooth /\u00a0Water resistance:\u00a05ATM /\u00a0Music storage:\u00a0N/A Hybrid smartwatches are an excellent way to keep things simple and subtle. The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light gets you the basics like push notifications, timers, and alarms. On the health front, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS workouts. (That said, GPS is tethered from your phone, not built in.) The design reminds me of a classier Swatch, particularly if you get the more colorful options in a minty green or pale blue. But the big reason the Light has dethroned our previous pick, the Garmin Vivomove Sport, is its extra-long battery life. Withings estimates it lasts up to 30 days on a single charge, and I got pretty close to that in testing with 25 days. Despite the Vivomove\u2019s more appealing $180 price tag, it only lasts about five days.  If you want a bit more out of a hybrid, you can also opt for the ScanWatch 2. It\u2019s an extra $100, but you get EKGs and atrial fibrillation detection, temperature sensors, SpO2 readings, and an altimeter for measuring elevation. It also looks a bit more elegant on the wrist, partly because of a secondary dial that tracks your daily step progress.  If neither matches your style, the Vivomove Sport is still a good option that gets you access to Garmin\u2019s in-depth platform. Its Vivomove Trend is a slightly more upscale option that also supports Qi charging.  Sizes:\u00a041mm w/ 18mm straps; 45mm w/ 22mm straps /\u00a0Weight:\u00a040g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 /\u00a0Battery life:\u00a0Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 /\u00a0Display type:\u00a0OLED touchscreen /\u00a0GPS:\u00a0GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO /\u00a0Connectivity:\u00a0Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /\u00a0Water resistance:\u00a05ATM /\u00a0Music storage:\u00a08GB Garmin is best known for making rugged GPS watches that have excellent fitness features but aren\u2019t so smart otherwise. But the $449.99 Venu 3 caters to people who want top-notch fitness tracking without sacrificing productivity features.  It\u2019s got a colorful and vibrant always-on OLED display and comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like its predecessor, the Venu 2 Plus, it also has a microphone and speaker so you can take and make calls directly from the wrist. It also has a clever workaround for digital assistants \u2014\u00a0it uses Bluetooth to work with whatever assistant is already on your phone. You\u2019d think more fitness trackers would do this, but they don\u2019t. It worked well in testing, though digital assistants aren\u2019t always the smartest at understanding commands. The Venu 3 doesn\u2019t have the best third-party app ecosystem, but it has Spotify, Deezer, and Amazon Music for offline playback. Android users can also send quick responses for texts, and the watch works with either iOS or Android for folks who want to keep their options open. It also has fall detection, live tracking, and contactless payments. As for health features, it has Garmin\u2019s latest heart rate sensor, which enables its FDA-cleared EKG app to detect atrial fibrillation. Otherwise, you get built-in GPS, continuous heart rate monitoring, all of the advanced coaching features in the Garmin Connect app, and Garmin\u2019s famous in-depth health data. The Venu 3 also improves sleep tracking with nap detection and adds audio-guided meditation sessions. There\u2019s also a new wheelchair mode.  This isn\u2019t the most hardcore Garmin that money can buy, but it\u2019s definitely the smartest. The price is a bit high compared to most smartwatches, but by Garmin standards, it\u2019s middle-of-the-pack. Size:\u00a046mm w/ 22mm straps /\u00a0Weight:\u00a034g /\u00a0Battery life:\u00a0Up to 14 days /\u00a0Display type:\u00a0OLED touchscreen /\u00a0GPS:\u00a0Dual-frequency and 6 GNSS systems /\u00a0Connectivity:\u00a0Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /\u00a0Water resistance:\u00a05ATM /\u00a0Music storage:\u00a02.3GB Amazfit\u2019s made a name for itself making budget wearables that punch far above their weight. I\u2019ve been consistently impressed by the GTR line of smartwatches over the years, and the $199.99 GTR 4 is no exception.\u00a0 Not only does it have a classic look, but you also get 14 days of battery life and a color, always-on OLED display. New to the GTR 4 is dual-band GPS \u2014 a feature that Apple and Garmin only recently introduced to their higher-end smartwatches. Or, if you like to plan your own trail runs or hikes, you can import your own GPS routes, too. It tracks 150 sports and features all-day continuous heart rate monitoring. You can also monitor stress, sleep, and SpO2 levels. For smart features, you can take calls on the wrist, and it has two digital assistants: Alexa and a proprietary offline assistant. The device also syncs with Strava and Adidas Running.\u00a0 The GTR 4 isn\u2019t the best smartwatch around. Flagship watches can do everything the GTR 4 can do but in a sleeker, more polished package. However, they can\u2019t do it at this price. If price is your main priority, this gets you incredible bang for your buck. Plus, you can frequently find Amazfit devices on sale. The icing on the cake is it works just as well on Android as it does on iOS.  Update, August 1st: Added new info about the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra."

        "body": "Apple announced its latest iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets a few months ago, and after several quarters of soft sales, the new products led to a significant boost for the company\u2019s iPad division. Combined with strong performance in services and Mac, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $85.8 billion, up 5 percent from the year-ago quarter. iPhone and wearables revenue was relatively flat as consumers await a new wave of products soon. By the time Apple reports its next earnings, the company will have introduced the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Among other improvements, the Pro models will have slightly larger displays, while the standard iPhones will pick up the Action Button that debuted last year. Those devices are expected to arrive in September along with new AirPods earbuds and refreshed Apple Watch hardware. Apple is also rumored to be working on spec bumps for its MacBook Pro and Mac Mini, which are both likely to be upgraded with the M4 chip sometime this fall.  On the software side, the company is in the midst of public betas for its forthcoming iOS 18,  iPadOS 18, tvOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and watchOS 11 releases. For the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, these updates will mark Apple\u2019s big entrance into generative AI features, which will include some integrations with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. The company is planning to roll out this Apple Intelligence suite of software capabilities with iOS 18.1.  \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve redeployed a lot of people onto AI that were working on other things,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC. \u201cCertainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we\u2019re spending for AI and Apple Intelligence.\u201d Elsewhere, Apple is facing a high-profile antitrust case from the Justice Department \u2014 a courtroom showdown that the company is trying to have dismissed \u2014 and is still in the early months of loosening its grip on the App Store by allowing third-party alternatives (in the EU) and letting emulators into the store (everywhere) for the first time."

        "body": "When you\u2019re flying, noise-canceling earbuds like the AirPods Pro are great for tuning out the world, but they come with one drawback: they don\u2019t work with the in-flight entertainment systems on airplanes. Luckily, Bluetooth transmitters like Twelve South AirFly Duo\u00a0exist that solve that problem for you, and right now, you can buy one for an all-time low price of $29.99 ($15 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. With its integrated 3.5mm cable, the Duo is dead simple to use: just plug into the headphone jacks on seatback entertainment systems, pair up your Bluetooth-equipped wireless headphones or earbuds, and you\u2019re good to go. The beauty of this is that you\u2019ll probably end up enjoying even better audio quality, too, as in all likelihood, your own set of Bluetooth headphones is better than the wired earbuds planes typically offer. Plus, if you and your travel companion want to watch the same shows together, you can even connect it to a second pair.  Aside from audio sharing, the wireless headphone adapter also has other things going for it that make it a great buy. When it\u2019s time to recharge, you can do so pretty quickly thanks to USB-C support. The Duo will also come in handy long after your flight ends, too, because it can connect wireless headphones to other devices as well, ranging from a Nintendo Switch to compatible treadmills."

        "body": "I\u2019ve been looking for a good alarm clock with voice control for years now \u2014 and with Amazon\u2019s newest smart speaker, I think I\u2019ve found it. The Nest Hub is too big for my nightstand and the Echo Show 5 is too bright, but the new Echo Spot ($79.99) is just right.  While it\u2019s not perfect, the Spot\u2019s small footprint, minimalist display, impressive sound for its size, built-in voice assistant, and snappy responses fill most of my needs. These features make it a good option if you want the benefits of a smart speaker and some basic visual information in your bedroom without the distractions of a large screen.\u00a0 As the sequel to the original Echo Spot that was discontinued in 2019, the new Echo Spot ditches the camera, which was our main gripe with the earlier version. It also replaces the full circular screen with a semicircular display that shows the clock. While that display is a bit too small (and slightly cheap-looking), overall, the Spot is a capable smart alarm clock for a good price, especially when it\u2019s on sale.  An Alexa-powered smart speaker, the Spot follows the design cues of the Echo Pop with its flat circular front, but it adds a small 2.83-inch display above the speaker grille. This is a touchscreen display that shows a clock or various animations when playing music, telling the weather, setting timers, and controlling smart home devices. It\u2019s very responsive to touch, although it\u2019s limited in terms of what you can do with it. The Spot also responds well to Alexa's voice commands with minimal lag and can trigger Alexa Routines with presence detection using an ultrasound sensor. It\u2019s a Bluetooth speaker (there\u2019s no line-out) and an\u00a0Alexa Matter controller\u00a0(over Wi-Fi). But unlike the Echo Dot, there\u2019s no temperature sensor and it doesn\u2019t act as an Eero mesh Wi-Fi extender.  The Spot\u2019s screen is primarily designed as a clock, showing just enough information to be useful and not so much to be annoying. Instead of the rotating content you find on the Echo Shows that sometimes push ads for Amazon\u2019s services, the Spot just shows the current time and the time your next alarm is set. There\u2019s also an option to show the weather and date.\u00a0 The display is small enough to not be distracting at night thanks to a nighttime mode that switches to a simple red LED display. It has six fun clockfaces for daytime, although two of them feel a bit squished in the small rectangle allotted to them. It would look better if the screen took up the entire upper semicircle instead of just two-thirds of it. This could have enabled the neat Echo Show sunrise alarm clock feature that gradually brightens the whole screen.\u00a0 The Spot\u2019s small screen means that the clock either goes away or becomes very small when it\u2019s being used for anything other than a clock, which can be annoying. When it plays music, it shows a graphic visualizer and playback controls. When you\u2019re listening to a book, it shows the title (oddly, no controls), and for timers, it displays the countdown. If I want the full-screen clock to show up while doing any of these tasks, I have to say, \u201cAlexa, go Home\u201d or swipe down and tap the Home button. This speaks to the fact that the Spot isn\u2019t a smart display; it\u2019s more of a smart speaker with a screen. It\u2019s closer in function to the now-discontinued Echo Dot With Clock than to the Echo Show 5. I found the Spot\u2019s display easier to read on my nightstand than the Dot, and I liked the additional control options, but if you prefer the no-frills LED dot-matrix look of the Dot with Clock, then the Spot will have too much screen for you.\u00a0 The Spot\u2019s touchscreen allows for basic control over things like music playback and smart home devices. But while it shows a button to turn a light on or off and a slider to adjust brightness for, say, a lamp, I have to use my voice to get those controls to show up. I also couldn\u2019t use the screen to set an alarm on the Spot\u2019s screen. Again, I had to use my voice or the Alexa app. This feels like a miss in a device designed to be an alarm clock.\u00a0 Otherwise, the Spot\u2019s alarm clock is very good. There\u2019s a wide array of wake-up tones, including a classic ring. I can also say, \u201cAlexa, wake me up at 6AM to Taylor Swift\u201d or ask it to wake me up to a specific radio station. Plus, I can have the smart lights in my bedroom turn on with the alarm or have an Alexa Routine run.\u00a0 Annoyingly, the \u201csnooze\u201d and \u201cstop alarm\u201d buttons on the screen are tiny \u2014 too small to easily hit when you wake up bleary-eyed. But using voice or tapping the top of the Spot to snooze works fine. Also, there\u2019s no backup battery, which isn\u2019t easy to find on any smart speaker / alarm clock but is an important feature for my family. As far as audio is concerned, the Spot\u2019s forward-facing 1.73-inch mono driver makes it a good speaker for listening to music, sleep sounds, or an audiobook in bed. It\u2019s not as room-filling as the Dot but has clearer vocals and delivers a richer sound than the smaller Echo Pop.\u00a0 The Spot also works with Alexa audio calling, and I can use it as a home intercom with the Alexa Drop In feature \u2014 useful when I want to tell my teenager to turn his music down. It\u2019s the only dedicated smart alarm clock I\u2019ve tested that has this feature. There are a number of third-party smart alarm clocks with built-in Alexa, but none support Drop In.\u00a0 As I mentioned previously, the Spot is not really a smart display (despite that being what Amazon calls it). You can\u2019t use it as a digital photo frame or video calling device or watch a security camera\u2019s livestream or video content on it. But I didn\u2019t miss any of those features in a bedside device. If they\u2019re important to you, consider the Echo Show 5, which can do everything the Spot can plus all of the above but is bigger and brighter with its larger screen.\u00a0 Overall, I like the direction is taking Amazon with its newest Echos, creating more defined use cases for its smart speakers and displays beyond streaming music and setting timers. First, there was the Echo Hub, a smart home controller; now, there\u2019s the Echo Spot, a smart alarm clock.  While $80 is expensive compared to the $50 Echo Dot,\u00a0you\u2019re getting more functionality with the Spot. Plus, if you can find it on sale (like the recent deep discount for Prime Day), it\u2019s an easy buy. There\u2019s room for improvement, but if you\u2019ve been looking for a better voice-controlled smart alarm clock, the Spot deserves a spot on your nightstand. Photography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. In order to use the Amazon Echo Spot, you\u2019ll need to download the Alexa app for iOS and Android. An Amazon account is required to sign in. By signing up for one of those,\u00a0you must agree to its conditions of use. After that, setup is on the device, where \u201cby proceeding, you agree to Amazon\u2019s conditions of use and all of the terms found\u00a0here.\u201d You can explore the documentation at that link, but below, we\u2019ve listed the 17 terms you must agree to: Additionally, you can choose to set up\u00a0Voice ID\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon Sidewalk. More information can be found at the\u00a0Alexa Privacy Hub\u00a0and on the\u00a0Alexa and Alexa Device FAQ page. Final tally: there are 17 mandatory agreements and two optional ones."

        "body": "Apple has asked a federal judge to dismiss the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust case against it, claiming that the government is asking the court \u201cto sanction a judicial redesign of one of the most innovative and consumer-friendly products ever made: iPhone.\u201d The DOJ and 16 state and district attorneys general claimed in their March lawsuit that Apple has illegally monopolized the US smartphone market. The government claimed Apple broke the law by maintaining a closed ecosystem for the iPhone in pursuit of profits and at the expense of consumers and innovation. The government pointed to several examples in its complaint, including allegedly suppressing message quality between iPhones and competing platforms like Android and preventing third-party developers from making competing digital wallets for the iPhone with tap-to-pay functionality. Apple says in a new filing that the DOJ\u2019s argument \u201cis based on the false premise that iPhone\u2019s success has come not through building a superior product that consumers trust and love, but through Apple\u2019s intentional degradation of iPhone to block purported competitive threats.\u201d It calls that idea \u201coutlandish\u201d and says that antitrust law protects its ability \u201cto design and control its own product\u201d rather than cater to third-party developers. And Apple says it has given third-party developers \u201cexceptionally broad\u201d access to the iPhone platform \u201cwhile also enforcing reasonable limitations to protect consumers.\u201d Apple characterizes the third-party developers at issue in the complaint not as small upstarts, but rather as \u201cwell-capitalized social media companies, big banks, and global gaming developers, all of whom are formidable competitors in their own right and none of whom have the same incentives to protect the integrity or security of iPhone as Apple has.\u201d  Apple lays out five main reasons for which it says the court should dismiss the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit: Apple requests oral arguments to debate its motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Apple says if the government gets its way, it would \u201charm innovation and risk depriving consumers of the private, safe, and secure experience that differentiates iPhone from every other option in the marketplace.\u201d The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
