        "body": "The Morningstar US Market Index, our proxy for the broad US equity market, rose 1.59% in July, yet returns were highly skewed toward small-cap and value stocks. The price/fair value of the US stock market rose as high as 1.07 in mid-July, as stocks peaked\u2014one of its highest readings\u2014but has since retreated to 1.03 as of month-end. The rotation into small-cap and value stocks began shortly after the release of the June Consumer Price Index report. Inflation came in well below expectations and bolstered the markets expectation that the Fed would begin to ease monetary policy starting after its September meeting. Historically, small-cap stocks have tended to outperform in an environment of falling interest rates and easing monetary policy. As we noted in our Q3 2024 Stock Market Outlook, with valuations for stocks leveraged to artificial intelligence either already fully valued or, in many cases, overvalued, it appears that the AI stock trade is over for now. With investors looking to stay fully invested in the market, yet looking for undervalued areas to redeploy their profits, value stocks have already begun to benefit from this market rotation. The rotation into small-cap and value stocks has led our valuations by category and sector to begin consolidating toward fair value. At this point, only a handful of sectors are undervalued. With fewer dislocations at the sector level for investors to take advantage of in this period of consolidation, to outperform the market, we think investors will need to look to contrarian investment opportunities. Specifically, we look to those areas that have underperformed, are unloved, and\u2014most importantly\u2014are undervalued. These contrarian plays are often \u201cstory stocks,\u201d which are typically situations such as emerging turnarounds or other catalysts that may have greater short-term risk, require a greater amount of analysis, and often take time for the story to work out. By capitalization, the Morningstar US Small Cap Index rose 6.88%, edging out the 6.13% index return for the Morningstar US Mid Cap Index and outpacing the paltry 0.51% index return of the Morningstar US Large Cap Index. According to our valuations, small-cap stocks remain significantly undervalued, trading at a 14% discount to our fair value, whereas mid-cap stocks only trade at a 3% discount and large-cap stocks remain overvalued at a 5% premium. With valuations for small-cap stocks significantly undervalued on both a relative and absolute basis, and the Fed poised to begin easing monetary policy, we suspect small-cap stocks still have a long path of outperformance ahead. By style, the Morningstar US Value Index rose the most in July, rising 5.70%, whereas the Morningstar US Core Index only rose 3.40% and Morningstar US Growth Index lagged behind at 0.63%. Yet, even after this surge, the value category remains the most attractive, trading at a 6% discount to fair value. According to our valuations, core stocks remain the most overvalued, at a 9% premium, and growth stocks trade at a 2% premium. Looking forward, we expect value stocks should continue to outperform. Not only are they undervalued, but they also should perform better in an economic environment where we forecast the rate of economic growth will slow sequentially for the remainder of this year and remain sluggish in the first half of 2025. Just a little over a year ago, US regional banks plummeted following the insolvency of Silicon Valley Bank. The utility sector submerged last fall as interest rates rose. And real estate has long been the most hated asset class on Wall Street. Yet, the market overreacted to the downside in each case, and over the past year, these sectors have at times been some of the most undervalued. The real estate sector finally found favor as the Morningstar US Real Estate Index was the top-performing sector and rose 7.50% in July. Yet, even after this surge, it remains the most undervalued sector, trading at a 6% discount to fair value. While valuations in urban office space appear to have greater short-term risk, we continue to see opportunities in real estate assets that have defensive characteristics, such as those tied to healthcare facilities (5-star-rated HealthPeak Properties DOC and 4-star Ventas VTR) or triple net lease providers (5-star-rated Realty Income O) that trade at a wide margin of safety from our intrinsic valuation and pay healthy dividends. The Morningstar US Financial Services Index rose 6.93% last month. However, while many US regional banks such as 4-star rated U.S. Bancorp USB remain undervalued, US regional banks are nowhere near as undervalued as they were a year ago. In fact, a number of stocks among US megabanks and insurance companies have run up too far in our view. As such, overall the financials sector now trades at a 6% premium to our fair values. With their relatively high dividend yields and their slow but steady earnings growth, utilities are often used by investors as a substitute for fixed income and are negatively correlated with interest rates. It\u2019s no surprise that utilities stocks sold off as interest rates rose in 2023, but as we noted in our 4Q 2023 US Market Outlook, the utilities sector fell to valuations that were near their lowest levels over the past decade. Yet while valuations were low, we also noted that fundamentally the outlook for the sector was as strong as we had ever seen it. At that point, we had already incorporated into our forecasts that the amount of electricity demand growth from data centers would increase a cumulative 46% through 2032. Obvious plays on the rapid growth of artificial intelligence had already run up earlier this year, and investors have been looking for other ways to play this growth. Recently, we have seen an increase in the number of stories that make the case that the utilities sector will benefit from the heightened demand for electricity. We agree with this thesis, as artificial intelligence computing requires multiple times more electricity to power its semiconductors than traditional computing. However, in our view, if you are just buying utilities today to play this theme, you are already 10 months late to the game. Since the utilities sector bottomed out on Oct. 2, the Morningstar US Utilities Index has risen 33%. After trading at a deep discount last fall, the utilities sector now trades at a 5% premium to fair value. While sector average may be overvalued, we continue to see a number of attractive stocks in the utilities sector, such as 4-star rated WEC Energy Group WEC and Entergy ETR. Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META account for almost 70% of the communications sector market capitalization. These two stocks skewed the index average higher earlier in the year, and then their pullback in July skewed the index lower. The Morningstar US Communication Services Index dropped 3.86% in July, which was attributable to those two stocks. Following this pullback, the sector currently trades at a 4% discount to fair value, but in our view, the best opportunities lie among the traditional communications providers, as both Alphabet and Meta are rated 3 stars. We see much better value in AT&T T or Verizon VZ, two 4-star rated stocks that trade at 16% and 24% discounts, respectively, to our valuation and that pay high dividend yields. Among the media names, Comcast CMCSA is rated 4 stars, trades at a 24% discount to fair value, and has a 3.00% dividend yield. Technology was the second-worst-performing sector in July as the Morningstar US Technology Index dropped 1.55%. An attribution analysis shows that Microsoft MSFT and Nvidia NVDA were responsible for 113 basis points and 83 basis points, respectively, of the decline. Last month, we noted that, as the broad market valuation was getting to be frothy, much of the overvaluation is concentrated in a few thematic, mega-cap stocks, generally those technology stocks most closely tied to artificial intelligence. Considering that AI stocks are generally at best fairly valued and at worst overvalued, we see much better opportunities elsewhere in the market. Even after accounting for the pullback in the technology sector, it remains overvalued, trading at a 6% premium to fair value. Morningstar\u2019s US Economics team expects a combination of moderating inflation and slowing economic growth will provide the backdrop for the Fed to begin cutting the federal-funds rate at the September meeting. Our base case projects the federal-funds rate will end 2024 at a range of 4.75% to 5.00%. We also forecast the Fed will continue to cut the federal-funds rate further throughout 2025. In the longer end of the yield curve, our US Economics team also projects that long-term interest rates will be on a downward path in the second half of 2024 and in 2025. They project the 10-year US Treasury yield will average 4.25% in 2024 and average 3.50% in 2025. Steady as she goes. With the broad equity market trading just a little over fair value, we advocate for investors to position themselves at a market weight within their targeted long-term asset allocations between equity and fixed income. With the rate of economic growth projected to slow for the next few quarters, stock markets could become increasingly volatile this summer and pullbacks could provide an opportunity to move back to overweight equity positions. Within the equity portion of their portfolio, we continue to see the best valuation in the value category and in small-cap stocks. Undervalued sectors to overweight include real estate, energy, and communications. However, within these sectors, we think individual stock-picking remains vital. Overvalued areas to underweight include industrials, consumer defensive, technology, and financials. Yet even within an overvalued sector, there are often numerous undervalued opportunities for those investors willing to spend the time to look for them. "

        "body": "David Harrell: Hi. I\u2019m David Harrell, editor of the Morningstar DividendInvestor newsletter. In this monthly series, we take a look at the dividend prospects of three stocks that are popular with income investors. Duke Energy is one of the country\u2019s largest regulated utilities. On July 15, Duke declared a quarterly dividend of 1 dollar and 4.5 cents a share, a 2% increase from its previous rate, which is in line with the utility\u2019s 2.2% annualized dividend-growth rate over the past five years. The stock currently yields 3.7% and is trading roughly in line with its Morningstar fair value estimate. Morningstar analysts believe Duke\u2019s dividend is well covered with its regulated utilities\u2019 earnings, and they forecast average annual dividend growth of 4%, which implies a 63% payout ratio, based on their 2028 earnings estimate. American Tower owns and operates more than 220,000 cell towers. The firm initiated a quarterly dividend in 2012 when it converted to a real estate investment trust. American Tower yields 3% and has increased its dividend at an annualized rate of 8.6% over the past five years. But don\u2019t expect any dividend growth in 2024. After bumping its quarterly rate to $1.70 per share for its first payout of the year, the company returned to the previous rate of $1.62 for the next two payouts, which will keep the total dividend for 2024 roughly the same as it was in 2023. Morningstar analysts expect dividend growth to resume in 2025 after the company has reduced its debt; during American Tower\u2019s April 30 earnings call, management indicated its intention for that as well. The stock currently trades just below its Morningstar fair value estimate. Wells Fargo, one of the Big Four US banks, made a large dividend cut in 2020, reducing its quarterly dividend rate from $0.51 to $0.10. Following stress-test results, Wells Fargo has increased its quarterly payout to $0.40 per share, up from $0.35. Based on the new annual rate of $1.60, the stock is yielding 2.7%. While the quarterly dividend remains below its 2020 precut rate, Wells has now increased the quarterly dividend rate fourfold over the past four years. Morningstar analysts expect the annual dividend to increase to $1.73 over the next four years, with a payout ratio of roughly 30% to 35%. Like the previous two stocks, Wells is also trading in line with its Morningstar fair value estimate. I\u2019m David Harrell from Morningstar DividendInvestor. Thanks for watching, and we\u2019ll see you next month. Watch 3 Dividend Stocks for June 2024 for more from David Harrell."

        "body": "Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF\u2019s BND advantage comes from its razor-thin fee and expansive portfolio of US investment-grade bonds. The exchange-traded fund tracks the Bloomberg US Aggregate Float Adjusted Index, which captures investment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable bonds denominated in US dollars. The index applies a minimum size requirement for each type of bond, which helps the index remain investable given the large asset base following it. While it captures a broad swath of the bond market, the index excludes certain types, such as inflation-linked bonds, Eurodollar bonds, non-ERISA-eligible commercial mortgage-backed securities, and bonds with equity features. It weights selected holdings by market value after reducing the amount outstanding for bonds held by the Federal Reserve to adjust for float. This weighting scheme tilts the fund toward the largest issuers, resulting in a US Treasuries overweight compared with peers in the intermediate core bond Morningstar Category. The fund tends to have around 40% of its assets in these instruments compared with under 30% for the category average. A heavy dose of Treasuries also results in a high allocation to the highest rung of the investment-grade space. As of June 2024, the fund parked over 70% of its assets in bonds rated AA and above\u2014around 10 percentage points higher than the category average. This conservative risk allocation can help performance during credit shocks. For instance, the fund offered superior protection during both the 2008 financial crisis and the March 2020 coronavirus drawdown. However, it can lag when credit risk pays off, such as during the latter half of 2020. Active funds in the category can dip into riskier assets to find pockets of opportunities. The index\u2019s float adjustment steers it away from agency mortgage-backed securities compared with its category peers and the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, its non-float-adjusted counterpart. Still, this sector makes up around 20% of this fund\u2019s portfolio, the third-largest sector after Treasuries and corporate bonds. The fund\u2019s average duration has steadily increased as it followed the trend in issuance activities. Owing to the historically low interest rates in recent years, companies have been borrowing more at the longer end of the yield curve. As of June 2024, the fund\u2019s effective duration was around 6.0 years. Category peers tend to hold shorter-duration portfolios, so the fund tends to lag its peers when interest rates rise. Nonetheless, a broad scope and low fee should still provide a performance edge over category peers in the long run. From its 2007 inception through June 2024, this ETF has outperformed the category average by 28 basis points annualized. Much of this outperformance comes from its conservative risk profile and overweighting in US Treasuries. This provided better protection during credit shocks as investors fled to the safe haven provided by Treasuries. For instance, the fund did significantly better than most of its category peers during the 2008 global financial crisis, outpacing the category average by 6.84 percentage points during the trough of the shock. Similarly, the fund beat its average peer by 2.13 percentage points during the covid-19 shock in early 2020. The fund will lag category peers when risk pays off. It trailed the category average by 2.46 percentage points when credit spreads rapidly shrank between late March and December 2020. The fund\u2019s slightly higher average duration has caused underperformance when rates rise. During the last five months of 2016, the fund lagged the category average by 1.03 percentage points as yields rose on the back of fear over increasing interest rates. It also underperformed when yields on Treasuries rose during the first 10 months of 2018. The fund outperformed the category average by 20 basis points during 2022, however, as holding safer assets outweighed the fund\u2019s relatively higher duration risk."

        "body": "Investors have endured a lot of stock market volatility during the past few years. Given ongoing uncertainty about interest rates and the economy, investors may be wondering which stocks to buy now against this backdrop. Regardless of where interest rates and the economy are headed, investors may want to own companies that offer some sense of certainty in terms of cash flows and company fundamentals. That\u2019s where Morningstar\u2019s Best Companies to Own list comes in. The companies that make up this list have significant competitive advantages. We believe the best companies have predictable cash flows and are run by management teams that have a history of making smart capital-allocation decisions. But the best companies aren\u2019t always the best stocks to buy. How much an investor pays to own a company\u2014best or otherwise\u2014is important, too. So, here we\u2019re focusing on the 10 best companies with the most undervalued stock prices today. The 10 most undervalued stocks from our Best Companies to Own list as of July 30, 2024, were: Here\u2019s a little bit about why we like each of these companies at these prices, along with some key Morningstar metrics. All data is as of market close on July 30. Yum China\u2019s stock is 60% undervalued relative to our fair value estimate of $76 per share and stays at the top of our list of best stocks to buy again this month. Morningstar senior analyst Ivan Su believes the current market price overlooks two things: Yum China\u2019s opportunities for restaurant expansion in China\u2019s growing fast-food industry and margin improvement that will be realized by operating leverage and ongoing digital investments. Over the longer term, we believe there are several opportunities for Yum China to gain a share in the fragmented $700 billion Chinese restaurant market. Our conviction in rising fast-food penetration is underpinned by three long-term secular trends: longer working hours for urban consumers, rapidly rising disposable income, and ever-smaller family sizes. Coupled with strong brand recognition and an unrivaled supply chain, Yum China is set to be the prime beneficiary of growing Chinese fast-food spending. With brands that include its namesake, Clinique, and Aveda, Estee Lauder is a leading provider of premium beauty products that has a strong presence across both brick-and-mortar and digital channels. We expect the company to benefit from a consumer shift in both developed and emerging markets toward higher-end beauty brands, explains Morningstar analyst Dan Su. However, we see risks on the horizon. Estee Lauder\u2019s premium products are exposed to macro cyclicality as consumers tend to trade down or delay their higher-ticket discretionary spending amid recession concerns. In addition, Estee may need some time to refresh its lackluster cosmetics portfolio. Estee Lauder stock is trading 53% below our fair value estimate of $210 per share. Ambev stock trades 42% below our fair value estimate of $3.60 per share. Ambev is the largest brewer in Latin America and the Caribbean and is Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s subsidiary in the region. It produces, distributes, and sells beer and PepsiCo products in Brazil and other Latin American countries and owns Argentina\u2019s largest brewer, Quinsa. Brahma, the Brazilian brewer, was the first foray into the consumer product manufacturing industry by private equity group 3G. In 2000, 3G merged two Brazilian brewers, Brahma and Antarctica, creating Ambev. In part because of the favorable industry structures, and in part because of its 3G heritage, Ambev is a highly profitable business. \u201cWe estimate the company faced around BRL 3 billion in higher raw material costs in 2022,\u201d says Morningstar director Ioannis Pontikis, \u201cand a reversal of that by the end of 2024 would increase the gross margin by 3 percentage points, all else equal.\u201d Pontikis also points to premiumization as a long-term growth and margin driver. The largest athletic footwear brand in all major markets, Nike dominates categories like running and basketball with popular shoe styles. We view Nike as the leader of the athletic apparel market and believe it will overcome current challenges, such as uneven demand for sportswear in key markets, argues Morningstar senior analyst David Swartz. Nike\u2019s consumer plan is led by its Triple Double strategy to double innovation, speed, and direct connections to consumers. The plan includes cutting product creation times in half, increasing membership in Nike\u2019s mobile apps, and improving the selection of key franchises while reducing its styles by 25%. Nike stock trades at a 40% discount to our fair value estimate of $124 per share. Zimmer Biomet is the undisputed king of large-joint reconstruction, says Morningstar senior analyst Debbie Wang, and we expect aging baby boomers and improving technology suitable for younger patients to fuel solid demand for large-joint replacement that should offset price declines. Zimmer has cultivated close relationships with orthopedic surgeons who make the brand choice. High switching costs and high-touch service lead to strong loyalty to the brand. Zimmer also aims to accelerate growth through innovative products and improved execution, which we view as critical. Zimmer Biomet stock trades 36% below our fair value estimate of $175 per share. Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s portfolio includes a variety of household and consumer health brands, such as Lysol, Finish, Durex, and Mucinex. Reckitt is well positioned in categories that benefit from secular growth drivers across consumer health and hygiene, but changes in leadership and the slew of bad news in recent years have left Reckitt in a somewhat vulnerable position, and the company could benefit from more decisive portfolio interventions and the resolution of legal concerns, says Morningstar analyst Diana Radu. Still, Reckitt\u2019s brands command premium prices in attractive categories across consumer health and home care. Reckitt Benckiser stock trades 36% below our fair value estimate of $16.80 per share. Anheuser-Busch InBev has built a vast global scale and regional density through past acquisitions like Grupo Modelo and SABMiller. The brewer\u2019s strategy is to buy brands with a promising growth platform, expand distribution, and ruthlessly squeeze costs from the business, observes Morningstar\u2019s Pontikis. \u201cAB InBev has one of the strongest cost advantages in our consumer defensive coverage and is among the most efficient operators,\u201d he adds. The brewer\u2019s free cash flow conversion has been consistently higher than peers\u2019 in recent years, but it needs to continue to deleverage its balance sheet to reduce its earnings volatility. AB InBev stock trades 34% below our fair value estimate of $90 per share. Polaris stock trades 30% below our fair value estimate of $120 per share. Polaris is one of the longest-operating brands in powersports. The company started to build its reputation and brand by producing snowmobiles and has since expanded into all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, boats, and electric vehicles, building a recreational and utility vehicle powerhouse. We think Polaris stands to capitalize on its research and development, solid quality, operational excellence, and acquisition strategy, says Morningstar senior analyst Jaime Katz. However, peers are innovating more quickly than in the past, which could jeopardize the firm\u2019s ability to take price and share consistently. While we expect the near term will continue to provide plenty of share volatility given uncertainty around the political and economic climate, we don\u2019t see any reason Polaris cannot return to 3%-4% sales growth over the long term Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rejoins our list of best companies to buy now. Taiwan Semiconductor is the world\u2019s largest dedicated contract chip manufacturer, with an almost 60% market share. The firm\u2019s disciplined approach to capital spending in 2024\u2014and possibly in the next few years\u2014reduces risks of oversupply and allows more flexibility in cutting-edge research to maintain its leadership, argues Morningstar analyst Phelix Lee. Taiwan Semiconductor stands to benefit from the growth of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and high-performance computing applications, which may last decades. Taiwan Semiconductor stock trades 27% below our fair value estimate of $213 per share. British American Tobacco rounds out our list of the best companies to buy now. While cigarettes will likely remain the driving force of profits in the industry for the next decade, British American Tobacco has been the most aggressive of the Big Tobacco makers with its push into new-generation products, with exposure to several emerging categories, including vaping, heated tobacco, and oral products, says Morningstar strategist Kristoffer Inton. We forecast tobacco volumes to decline about 4% annually through 2028, but we expect price increases and incremental revenue from next-generation products to offset the volume declines. British American Tobacco stock is trading 27% below our fair value estimate of $49 per share.

        "body": "Small-cap value funds can sometimes be a difficult space for investors to successfully navigate for various reasons. Compared with large-cap funds, small-cap funds pose several challenges, including higher volatility and potential liquidity troubles. For the five years ended May 2024, small-cap stocks significantly underperformed large caps, according to the Morningstar Style Box. That said, small-cap value stocks\u2019 relatively more moderate price multiples can lead to lower downside risk compared with high-priced growth names and can still be a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio. Over the five years ended in May, a correlation of 0.85 between the Russell 2000 Value Index and the S&P 500 suggests that having a small-value fund in a multi-asset portfolio added some diversification benefits. Below are three funds that beat the majority of their small-value Morningstar Category peers on a risk-adjusted basis over the past decade. DFA US Small Cap Value DFSVX, which holds a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Silver, takes a broadly diversified and cost-conscious approach. This fund is one of the most sprawling in the small-value category with more than 900 stocks. The portfolio managers consider the bottom 10% of US stocks by market cap, excluding companies working through bankruptcies. The managers exclude REITs, as they consider them to be a separate asset class, and utilities because of their limited upside. The team then considers stocks that land in the cheapest 35% of the small-cap market by price/book ratio. It avoids companies with unattractive expected returns based on low profitability and aggressive investment strategies. This fund\u2019s performance relative to the Russell 2000 Value Index depends on how the smaller-cap stocks trading at lower valuations perform. In 2020, the strategy lagged during the coronavirus-driven selloff (Feb. 1 through March 31) and outperformed during the rebound (April 1 to Dec. 31) Silver-rated AMG River Road Small Cap Value ARSVX plays defense. Seasoned comanagers Justin Akin and Andrew Beck lead this strategy with support from a solid team. The group conducts fundamental research in pursuit of companies with proficient management, strong financials, and a shareholder-centric approach. The team estimates a fair value for each security and likes those with low downside risk. Management uses a proprietary scorecard to quantify key components of its thesis, including its verdict around valuation assumption. The result is a high-conviction portfolio with roughly 50 to 70 securities. The valuation-led approach results in clear sector deviations from small-value peers and the category benchmark; the portfolio has consistently preferred more-stable industrial firms and invested relatively less in financial-services and biotech names. The portfolio captured less than 70% of the index\u2019s returns during down markets and beat the average category peer and index in every market drawdown of 10% or more. Bronze-rated Royce Small-Cap Total Return RYTRX has a new lead manager, but the team and approach remain compelling. Miles Lewis, who took over in May 2021, added more rigor to the approach through data, documentation, and formality. The team believes that dividend payers and companies that buy back their shares generally have competitive advantages, good management, and strong finances. The portfolio maintained at least 90% of its assets in dividend-paying stocks until mid-2022 when it started allowing up to 35% to be invested in companies that buy back stock or may pay dividends one day. Lewis\u2019 research found that more small-cap companies have been repurchasing shares and fewer have been paying out dividends. Dividend-paying stocks still dominate the portfolio despite the change. However, the fund now owns 75 to 100 names, roughly half as many as it used to.

        "body": "If you\u2019re a high-income heavy saver, you may still have additional funds to invest, even after you\u2019ve contributed the maximum allowable amounts to all of your tax-sheltered options: company retirement plans, IRAs, and even health savings accounts. For those additional savings, a taxable (nonretirement account) is usually going to be your best bet. Investments in a taxable account won\u2019t earn a tax break on the way in, as traditional tax-deferred account contributions will, or on the way out, as in the case with Roth contributions. Nor will they be eligible for matching contributions. But with a little bit of care, it\u2019s not that difficult to limit tax bills on taxable accounts on an ongoing basis. And when you eventually sell, assuming you\u2019ve held the position for more than a year, you\u2019ll pay the lower capital gains tax rate on any appreciation. Meanwhile, gains on traditional tax-sheltered accounts are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. You\u2019ll also have a lot of flexibility with a taxable account: to fund it to whatever level you wish and to pull as much as you want each year without strictures or penalties. I recently shared some tax-efficient portfolios for Vanguard diehards. This week\u2019s article includes some analogous portfolios for Fidelity investors, both retirees and retirement savers. All six portfolios consist of index funds for their equity exposure and municipal-bond funds for their fixed-income positions. The good news is that Fidelity fields excellent, low-cost options in all of those categories; nearly every holding in these portfolios earns a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold. Investors can also use total market exchange-traded funds for their portfolios\u2019 equity exposure instead of the traditional index mutual funds featured here. Tax-Efficient Bucket portfolios These portfolios are geared toward retired people who are actively drawing upon their portfolios for living expenses. Thus, they all use a bucket-type strategy that is organized by time horizon: cash for near-term expenditures (Bucket 1), high-quality bonds for short- to intermediate-term spending (Bucket 2), and equities for the longest part of the retiree\u2019s time horizon (Bucket 3). Retirees won\u2019t necessarily spend from the three buckets in exactly that sequence: In a rising equity-market year like 2023, for example, rebalancing out of appreciated equity positions can provide cash flow needs. And in a 2022-style environment\u2014a rare losing year for both stocks and bonds\u2014cash can provide spending money. The key to the bucket setup is that if stocks fall and stay down for an extended period of time, as they did during the 2000s\u2019 so-called \u201clost decade,\u201d retirees can spend through Buckets 1 and 2 without having to sell depreciated equity holdings. Notice that the Conservative portfolio has the greatest allocations to Buckets 1 and 2 and relatively less in Bucket 3 (stocks). Meanwhile, the Aggressive portfolio has a larger Bucket 3 allocation and less in Buckets 1 and 2, and the Moderate portfolio falls between the two. Retirees should think through their risk tolerances when deciding on a specific portfolio and asset allocation, but more importantly, they should factor in anticipated portfolio spending. Retirees who are spending more heavily from their taxable portfolios should generally favor the Conservative or Moderate portfolios, while those with more modest spending levels are better suited to the Aggressive version. The Aggressive version assumes a starting annual spending level of 4%, whereas the Conservative version is built around a 6% annual spending level. The Moderate portfolio assumes 5%. These portfolios use Fidelity\u2019s Gold-rated total stock market index funds for their equity exposure, which feature low expense ratios and fairly low tax costs. While not quite as tax-efficient as ETFs, these index funds will certainly beat most active funds on an aftertax basis. On the bond side, I\u2019ve populated the portfolios with Fidelity municipal-bond funds, which offer income distributions that are free from federal income tax. Investors will want to run the numbers on whether a municipal-bond fund is better than a taxable-bond fund once their own tax rate is factored in, however. Tax-Efficient Retirement Saver Portfolios In contrast to the above portfolios, which are geared toward retired investors who are in spend-down mode, these three portfolios are meant for the taxable accounts of people who are still working and saving for retirement. Like the portfolios above, however, these Retirement Saver portfolios vary in their amounts of stock exposure and in turn their risk levels. The Aggressive portfolio is geared toward someone with many years until retirement and a high tolerance/capacity for short-term volatility. The Conservative portfolio is geared toward people who are just a few years shy of retirement. The Moderate portfolio falls between the two in terms of its risk/return potential. These portfolios lean on the Morningstar Lifetime Allocation Indexes to guide their asset allocations. However, they forgo allocations to some notably tax-inefficient components of those indexes: real estate equities and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, for example. Such holdings are best positioned in tax-sheltered accounts, if possible. The holdings are identical to the Retirement Bucket portfolios above. While I\u2019ve used traditional index funds for their equity exposure, investors could reasonably use ETFs instead. These portfolios\u2019 holdings will tend to limit taxable income and capital gain distributions, and that will go a long way toward limiting the drag of taxes on their returns. However, investors will also want to practice sound tax management themselves, including maintaining a buy-and-hold mindset, harvesting capital losses (ideally employing the specific share identification method of cost-basis accounting), and realizing gains in low tax years if possible."

        "body": "Morningstar celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. In 1984, Morningstar founder Joe Mansueto began a quest to bring some much-needed transparency to the nascent mutual fund industry. He published quarterly \u201csourcebooks\u201d that gave investors access to data and information that had been out of reach. Eventually, Morningstar launched its ubiquitous \u201cstar rating\u201d for mutual funds, providing a visual representation of risk-adjusted historical return. Over time, Morningstar began analyzing closed-end funds, variable annuities, ADRs\u2014and eventually stocks and exchange-traded funds, too. Additional investor-friendly innovations soon followed: the Morningstar Style Box, meaningful fund category comparisons (rather than the prospectus objective), the Morningstar Rating for stocks, and Morningstar Medalist Ratings for funds, to name just a few. By bringing an independent voice that focused on clarity, costs, and long-term outcomes, Morningstar helped investors build confidence. To this day, Morningstar\u2019s mission is to empower investor success. And that mission continues to motivate the company\u2019s longtime employees (like me).  To celebrate, here\u2019s a sampling of some of the best investments across stocks, funds, and ETFs that epitomize Morningstar\u2019s approach to investing\u201440 ideas in total, divided equally between stocks and funds. These stocks all earn Morningstar Economic Moat Ratings of wide and Morningstar Capital Allocation Ratings of Exemplary and trade at 4- and 5-star ratings, which means they\u2019re undervalued. Data is as of July 26, 2024. Put simply, our approach to stock investing is to buy shares of great businesses at a discount to their worth. Great companies are those with solid competitive advantages that allow them to earn high returns on capital for years to come. These companies have carved out economic moats stemming from one (or more) of five sources of competitive advantage. We assign wide economic moat ratings to companies that we expect to outearn their costs of capital for at least 20 years.  We value companies by estimating their underlying cash flows. We\u2019re therefore looking at a company\u2019s fundamental value and where a stock is trading relative to that value\u2014not where the stock is trading relative to its historical price or its competition\u2014when calculating our fair value estimates. Moreover, to assign our Morningstar Rating, we take into account the predictability of a company\u2019s future cash flows\u2014the Morningstar Uncertainty Rating. A stock with higher uncertainty requires a larger margin of safety before earning a 4- or 5-star rating.  We think how adeptly management makes capital allocation decisions is an important consideration when buying a company\u2019s stock, too. Why does that matter? Because capital allocation decisions impact overall shareholder returns. The Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating considers how company management has managed the balance sheet, investments, and shareholder distributions. Those management teams that have done an outstanding job of allocating capital and that we expect to continue to do so are awarded an Exemplary rating; those teams that have done a weak job are given a Poor rating. Most management teams receive a Capital Allocation Rating of Standard      These funds land in the large-blend Morningstar Category, which makes them good core holdings for many investors. These no-load funds and ETFs earned Morningstar Medalist Ratings of Gold with 100% analyst coverage as of July 26, 2024. Unlike the historical Morningstar Rating for funds (or \u201cstar rating\u201d), the Morningstar Medalist Rating is a forward-looking analysis of a mutual fund or ETF\u2019s likelihood to outperform. Funds that receive Gold, Silver, or Bronze ratings are expected to outperform over a full market cycle. To arrive at the rating, our analysts examine a mutual fund or ETF\u2019s investment process, management team, and parent company, along with costs and long-term performance. The following pillars are used to designate an appropriate Medalist Rating for each respective fund: Parent Pillar: This pillar analyzes the parent organization in charge of managing the fund. People Pillar: This pillar evaluates the managers who are responsible for making key decisions regarding the fund. Process Pillar: This pillar determines whether the strategy that a parent organization applies to a fund is both effective and repeatable. While the fund industry isn\u2019t perfect, here\u2019s how it has improved in the past 40 years. Both active and passive mutual funds and ETFs can earn top ratings from Morningstar; if a fund is active or passive doesn\u2019t drive the rating. Funds with Gold, Silver, or Bronze ratings tend to have modest costs and repeatable processes, whether they\u2019re directly tracking an index or actively run by managers.          "

        "body": "Russel Kinnel: When funds reopen to new investors, it usually is in response to significant outflows that have reduced capacity constraints on the strategies. And outflows tend to happen after underperformance, of course. As a contrarian, I like to buy funds when they reopen because it usually means they invest in an out-of-favor area and their capacity challenges have diminished. Let\u2019s look at three great funds that have recently reopened. Vanguard reopened Vanguard Primecap Core and Vanguard Primecap to new investors recently. I won\u2019t be rushing to buy them because I\u2019ve owned Primecap Core for a long time. The funds straddle the large-growth/large-blend line, and the last two years they\u2019ve lagged large growth but beaten large blend. Recently, AI and weight loss drugs have been fueling the gains in growth investing, and these funds have Eli Lilly as their top holding, but they don\u2019t have Nvidia, so performance has been restrained. But I\u2019m still a fan of these Gold-rated funds. They have some of the best managers and analysts, and because these are Vanguard funds, they have some of the best bargains in investing. Primecap charges just 31 basis points, and Core charges 46 basis points. Both funds boast 15-year returns north of 14% annualized. I\u2019m also a big fan of the recently reopened T. Rowe Price New Horizons. The Silver-rated fund invests in small- and mid-cap growth stocks. Recent returns look unimpressive, but that\u2019s mostly because it has more in small caps than its peers do. Josh Spencer has done a fine job investing at this fund since he took over in 2019, and T. Rowe has a great group of analysts covering smaller growth companies. Finally, one other reason I like reopened funds is it means management has already proven they are willing to close funds to prevent asset bloat from spoiling the strategy.

        "body": "We are raising our fair value estimate for wide-moat Amazon AMZN to $195 per share from $193 after the company reported solid second-quarter results. The company\u2019s third-quarter outlook aligned with our revenue estimate and was better than our operating income estimate. Changes to our model are modest but center on continued profitability enhancements in the near term. Amazon continues to take strides in efficiency improvements throughout the network, which helps lower costs and improve delivery speeds, ultimately driving increased purchases by Prime members. After a pullback that began in early July, we see shares as increasingly attractive. Overall demand trends remain unchanged over the last year or so, with e-commerce showing signs of consumer stress. Second-quarter revenue grew 10% year-over-year as reported, or 11% in constant currency, to $148.0 billion, compared with the guidance mid-point of $146.5 billion. Relative to our estimates, online stores and third-party seller services drove most of the miss, while all segments were slightly light. Amazon Web Services was nicely ahead of our model. The two key segments for long-term growth, AWS and advertising, increased 19% and 20% year over year, as reported, respectively. Amazon\u2019s advertising growth continues to outpace its large internet peers, while AWS\u2019 growth accelerated sequentially for the fourth straight quarter. Margins have been consistently stronger than anticipated over the past year, and we continue to believe there is room for expansion as the multihub strategy continues to unlock efficiencies. Second-quarter profitability was impressive, with operating profit at $14.7 billion, compared with the high end of guidance at $14.0 billion. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.9%, compared with 5.7% a year ago. The international unit generated positive operating profits for the second straight quarter, which we think is a harbinger for longer-term expansion. While mixed compared with our estimates, we see Amazon\u2019s third-quarter guidance as in line, although we note that consensus had contemplated better profitability than our model. We think the outlook is consistent with our longer-term thinking but is helping drive shares lower in the after-market. The firm\u2019s third-quarter outlook includes revenue of $154.0 billion- $158.5 billion and operating income of $11.5 billion-$15.0 billion. Note that guidance includes 90 basis points of currency headwind, which is worse than we previously contemplated, making the revenue outlook better than it appears at first blush. Our previous aggressive revenue estimate was in line with the high end of guidance, while our previous estimate for operating profit was about $1 billion shy of the midpoint of guidance. After allowing for an upside in the quarter and smoothing various expense lines over the next year or so, we raised our fair value estimate modestly. We see a path to continuous margin improvement over time, even if these gains do not come in a linear fashion. On the retail side, Amazon continues to target the overall customer experience by expanding its selection and improving delivery speed. These factors continue to drive order frequency and ticket sizes for Prime members. Management reiterated it can continue to improve selection and delivery speed while improving margins, which we think has been fairly evident over the last year. The company confirmed that consumers continue to trade down, seek deals, and focus more on everyday items while eschewing larger ticket discretionary items. This is unsurprising and still represents the underpinnings of our near-term estimates. From a retail sales perspective, revenue from online stores increased 5%, physical stores increased 4%, third parties increased 12%, and subscription services increased 10% (all year over year, as reported). Paid unit growth accelerated to 12% year over year, buttressing the consumer trade-down narrative. AWS has shifted back to growth mode after the optimization efforts by clients have ended, and artificial intelligence has captured the customers\u2019 attention. We think these trends are consistent with our expectation that AWS is an overall key long-term driver for Amazon. Management noted a multibillion book of business from generative AI already. More importantly, customers have returned to migrating new workloads to the cloud. Management comments are consistent with recent remarks from Microsoft regarding its Azure business, and we think it bodes well for growth through 2026. Second-quarter AWS revenue growth accelerated to 19% year-over-year growth to $26.3 billion, compared with 17% growth last quarter and 12% a year ago. AWS backlog was $156.5 billion and grew 19% year over year in the quarter. The fact that backlog is bigger than revenue and is growing faster gives us confidence over the next several years. We believe Amazon is well-positioned in generative AI and should benefit as the technology adoption gains steam. We think the company\u2019s proprietary chips, Trainium and Inferentia, and Bedrock and other AI-related solutions, support this notion. Management believes generative AI can add tens of billions of dollars to revenue over the next several years. On AWS overall, we think the migration to the public cloud is an enormous opportunity and remains in the early stages of evolution, with AWS being the clear leader. Based on strong AI demand, Amazon plans to increase capital investments in data center capacity in the second half of the year, when it expects capital expenditures to exceed $32.5 billion from the first six months of the year. This is consistent with our model. Amazon\u2019s profitability improvements have been impressive, and we continue to think there is room for further improvements. In retail, the regional hub model has yielded both cost savings and improved delivery speeds. Management has already identified improvements, including inbound improvements and increased use of robotics, that can be made to the regional hubs, even as it continues to attack other margin improvement vectors. We also note that more immediately, shipping rates, fuel prices, and a more rational labor environment contributed to margin upside in the quarter. Strength in high-margin businesses like advertising and AWS have boosted margins. They should continue to do so in 2024 and beyond as ads make their way into Amazon\u2019s streaming portfolio and AWS continues to outgrow the retail business."

        "body": "Ivanna Hampton: Welcome to Investing Insights. I\u2019m your host, Ivanna Hampton. Different asset classes bring their own diversification benefits and risks to portfolios. Investors looking to hedge their bets can turn to non-US stocks, commodities, and crypto. How have these assets performed in the past few years? And what should you know if you\u2019re considering adding them to your portfolio? Three Morningstar researchers examined that in the 2024 Diversification Landscape report. Amy Arnott is one of the co-authors and a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Inc. Here\u2019s our conversation. Thanks for joining me, Amy. Amy Arnott: Great to be here. Hampton: Let\u2019s start with the benefits of diversifying beyond US stocks and bonds. Arnott: One reason is to make sure you have exposure to a variety of asset classes because you never know what\u2019s going to be in favor or out of favor in any given year. So, holding a diversified portfolio can help you mitigate the risk of being overexposed to any one particular area. Holding a diversified portfolio can also help reduce your portfolio\u2019s overall risk profile. So, if you are holding assets that have less than a perfect correlation, if their correlation coefficient is less than 1.0, that can help reduce your portfolio\u2019s overall level of risk. Hampton: Diversifiers are supposed to move in the opposite direction of stocks, right? Which asset classes did your team find that really didn\u2019t do that? Arnott: First, I would say it\u2019s very difficult to find asset classes that move in the opposite direction from stocks. If they did that all of the time, that would be a correlation coefficient of negative 1.0. Almost every asset class tends to be affected in some way by broad macro trends, things like inflation, interest rates, overall economic growth. So, usually, the correlation coefficients that we find between different asset classes are above zero, but we\u2019re just looking for correlations that are below 1.0. And basically, the lower the correlation, the greater the diversification benefit when you\u2019re adding to a portfolio. And the goal is really to, as I said, reduce the portfolio\u2019s overall risk profile and also gain exposure to a variety of areas in the market. Hampton: Any asset classes that didn\u2019t really move in the opposite direction? Arnott: I would point out three areas. One would be high-yield bonds, which are also known as junk bonds. These are bonds that have below-investment-grade credit ratings. They typically have weaker balance sheets, so they\u2019re more exposed not just to the company\u2019s performance but also to overall economic growth trends. So, if there is a downturn, they tend to behave more like stocks and actually have a fairly high correlation with the overall stock market. Another area I would highlight would be real estate, including real estate investment trusts. So, a lot of people hype up real estate as a good way to diversify your portfolio, and that was definitely true during some periods in the past. But I would say over the past 10 or 20 years, we\u2019ve seen a pretty steady increase in correlations for real estate, so you\u2019re really not getting much of a diversification benefit, especially not as much as a lot of people might expect. And then the other area I would highlight is cryptocurrency because these are digital assets that are very different from any type of traditional asset class, like stocks or bonds or other commodities. So, they\u2019ve historically had very low or even negative correlations with most traditional asset classes, but that trend has started to change as we\u2019ve seen a bunch of spot bitcoin ETFs come into the market this year, and more institutional investors have been adopting cryptocurrency, so crypto is moving more into the mainstream. And as that\u2019s been happening, we\u2019ve seen a pretty steady increase in correlations. Hampton: Let\u2019s turn to international stocks. Why has their correlation shifted more toward US stocks? Arnott: You would think that international stocks might not move in exactly the same way as the US, and that was definitely true if you go back several decades ago, and reasons for that are they\u2019re exposed to different local market conditions, currency movements from their home country, different demand patterns, and things like that. But as the economy is globalized, it\u2019s much easier for capital to flow across borders, and most larger companies now have revenue not just from their local country but from many different countries across the world. So, that is one thing that has led to the increase in correlations. I think another factor has been some of the big market shocks that we\u2019ve had, so things like the global financial crisis in 2008 and the pandemic-driven market downturn in early 2020. Those were both global market events when markets around the world dropped at the same time and then proceeded to rebound basically at the same time also, so that has led to an increase in correlations. Hampton: Amy, is there still a case to have international stocks in the portfolio? Arnott: I think there is. One reason would be if you look at the global market, international stocks make up about 40% of the total market cap, so if you only invest in US stocks, you\u2019re kind of leaving out a big part of the global opportunity set. Another argument for investing in international stocks is that the valuations are a bit lower. So, our equity analysts have found their price/fair value estimates for non-US stocks are lower than for US stocks overall. International stocks can also be a good way of diversifying sector exposure. Since technology stocks have been leading the US market for so long, they now make up about 30% of the overall equity market. But if you diversify into international stocks, you would get more exposure to old economy sectors, so things like industrials, financials, and utilities, which could offset some of that growth and tech stock exposure. And then the other major reason for investing in non-US stocks would be to diversify your currency exposure. The dollar has been very strong for the past several years, but if eventually that trend reverses, having exposure to other currencies could be beneficial. Hampton: Well, that is a case for international stocks. Commodities like gold and energy historically have had lower correlations with other asset classes. How have they performed over the last few years? Arnott: Gold has done quite well, it held up really well during the pandemic and has done pretty well ever since then. Gold typically does well as a safe haven during periods of market uncertainty or global geopolitical uncertainty. I would say energy has had more of a mixed performance. Oil, for example, did very well in 2021 and 2022, had more of a mixed performance in 2023 when the price of crude oil was bouncing around during the year, but ended the year a bit lower. And natural gas, we saw sort of a supply glut combined with weak demand because of the mild winter. Performance was more mixed on the energy side. Hampton: And commodities can help hedge against inflation. What could complicate that relationship in the future? Arnott: One thing is that commodity performance is very commodity-specific. So, commodity prices, since they\u2019re not generating cash flows, so the prices are basically determined by supply and demand. So, anytime you have a change either on the supply side or the demand side for a specific commodity, you can have pretty major price swings. I think another major factor would be some political and regulatory risk, especially around things like environmental concerns. So, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of political pressure to shift away from fossil fuels, and a lot of politicians oppose mining, and things like that, which could also be a headwind for commodities. Hampton: And you mentioned cryptocurrency earlier. What\u2019s been its correlation trend and where does it fit in a portfolio? Arnott: Cryptocurrency, these are digital assets, so they are very different from any other type of traditional asset, like a stock or a bond. And historically, cryptocurrency has had very low or even negative correlations with most other asset classes. But we have seen those correlations steadily increasing over recent years as institutional investors have been adopting crypto, and we have a bunch of spot bitcoin ETFs that were approved. So, as crypto has moved more into the mainstream, correlations have increased. Another thing I would point out is that even though crypto has generally had pretty low correlations, the correlation does tend to spike during market drawdowns. So, you\u2019re not really getting diversification value when you need it the most, which is when the market is down. So, because of that, I would look to crypto as more of a speculative asset, and you definitely want to keep it to a very small percentage of your portfolio if you own any at all. Hampton: We\u2019ve talked about publicly-traded investments, your team also looked at private-market investing. What should investors know? Arnott: Private-market investing encompasses a wide range of securities that aren\u2019t available to the general public. So, things like private equity, venture capital, private credit, private real estate. And because these types of assets aren\u2019t traded as frequently, they can offer some diversification benefits. But I would also point out they are also a lot less liquid than traditional asset types. And because the pricing is much less frequent, sometimes they can be subject to dramatic price resets, which can increase the risk. So, even though there\u2019s sort of a theoretical diversification benefit, at the end of the day, you\u2019re still investing in stocks and bonds. It\u2019s just in a slightly different format. Hampton: Did any of the asset classes\u2019 performances surprise you? Arnott: I think the biggest surprise for me has been real estate and just how much we\u2019ve seen correlations increase. I think over the past three years, if you look at correlations for a REIT index versus the overall US market, it\u2019s about 0.9. So, a lot of financial advisors and individual investors will advocate carving out part of your portfolio for real estate or REITs, specifically, because of the higher yield and the potential diversification benefits, but at least in recent years, we really haven\u2019t seen that benefit from diversification. Hampton: If someone wants to add diversifiers to their portfolio, what would you recommend? Arnott: I think bonds would be probably the best place to start, just to make sure that at an overall asset-class level, you have some exposure to both stocks and bonds. Treasury bonds and cash are probably going to be the strongest diversifiers. I think a couple of other areas that are worth considering for diversification would be commodities for a small percentage of your portfolio and potentially gold, as well as international stocks. We talked about the fact that correlations for international stocks have been trending up. But especially if you look at emerging markets, the correlations are much lower. So, I think there is a case to be made for having some broad international exposure, including emerging markets as part of a diversified portfolio.

        "body": "On this episode of The Long View, Carl Tannenbaum, Northern Trust\u2019s chief economist, breaks down the state of the financial system, where real estate stands today, and what we might expect from the Fed on inflation and interest rates. Here are a few excerpts from Tannenbaum\u2019s conversation with Morningstar\u2019s Christine Benz and Dan Lefkovitz. Dan Lefkovitz: Well, you referenced inflation and employment. We are recording this in the third quarter of 2024, and the Fed has yet to cut interest rates. You obviously have a unique perspective having worked for the Fed, but the market was expecting six interest-rate cuts coming into the year. What do you think economists underrated or missed? Carl Tannenbaum: Well, this is a question that my senior leadership has been asking me all year. Frankly, I\u2019ve been under some pressure as they\u2019ve been under the impression that lower rates would be very helpful. And anytime we have any slippage in any of our portfolios, the economist is the one who gets the blame. So sadly, this may be my last opportunity of appearing with you on your podcast. I will say that we were certainly not among the group that was expecting such an extensive and aggressive set of interest-rate cuts from the Fed. I think coming into the year, we had thought that they would wait until June and then move in a measured way after that. The market was certainly expecting a lot more. And what the market missed, I think, was first inflation did prove to be stickier than most of us thought. We had a nice decline in the rate of inflation in the second half of 2023. And I think people were expecting, some were expecting anyway, that it would continue. But we saw that there were areas of the price picture that were going to have what we\u2019ve called the \u201clast mile problem.\u201d In other words, getting all the way down to a level consistent with 2% was going to be harder. And those are housing. We created a little bit of a housing boom, but with low rates during the pandemic era. And so house prices have gone up and so rents often follow suit. I mentioned earlier that we\u2019ve had a lot of newcomers to the country who need places to live. That\u2019s also kept upward pressure on rents. And so, the cost of shelter, which is the biggest part of the Consumer Price Index and other inflation indexes, continues to increase at a year-over-year pace of more than 5%. The second area is basic services where shortages of labor, which I mentioned are getting better, but still there are shortages. Those prices have continued to escalate at nearly a 4% annual clip. And we\u2019ll need to see additional progress on both of those for the Fed to feel comfortable, eventually lowering interest rates. As we visit today, the news through the spring and the summer has gotten quite a bit better. Fed officials are sounding a little bit more contented and confident. And so, the market is set up for the first Fed cut in September, and I would tend to agree that that is a likely outcome. The market, though, is expecting the Fed to be very aggressive after that. I\u2019m still a bit cautious. And the reason is, is that inflation is still on a core basis, the way that the Fed looks at it at about 3% year over year. And the target is 2%. I\u2019ve been asked frequently whether the Fed would declare victory if they got close enough. And frankly, the answer is no. Having worked at the Fed, the seriousness with which the Federal Reserve takes its 2% inflation target is something that markets often understate. The Fed believes that that level is consistent with long-term investment performance, economic growth, job creation, and many other positive things. They also feel that they\u2019ve made a commitment to get inflation to that level and abandoning it when they haven\u2019t reached it would be a shock, frankly, to their credibility. So, for all of those who are wondering whether the Fed might change its inflation target or hedge a little bit, I just don\u2019t see that to be the case. Christine Benz: You referenced a lot of important subtopics there that we want to go back to. But we want to reference your Fed experience. Having worked at the Fed, what do you think observers misunderstand about the organization and how it operates? Tannenbaum: That\u2019s a long list, to be very honest with you. And I\u2019ll be candid that having followed the Fed and monetary policy for decades before joining them, there was a lot that surprised me when I got inside the walls. Let me just give you a sampling. The Fed is a big organization and monetary policy is only one of its facets. Certainly, people are familiar with the fact that it does bank supervision. But while it oversees individual institutions, it also feels like it is the safeguard of the stability of the financial system more broadly. And so, some of the inquiries they make and the decisions they take are aimed not necessarily at ensuring that no banks will fail, but more broadly, that the financial system will continue to perform well. And having joined the Fed in the spring of 2008, and certainly some of my partners here at Northern Trust based on that timing field that I caused the financial crisis. But instead, I found myself right in the middle of it. And many of the decisions taken by the Fed at that time were really aimed at making sure the financial system continued to operate to support the American economy as controversial as some of those changes were. The Fed is also still very engaged in the payment system. They facilitate payments, still clear checks, are at the forefront of technology that\u2019s helping payments become more efficient and fast. The Fed does a huge amount of work in community affairs. They look at a series of economic topics and try and bring smart people together to form intelligent policy. Austan Goolsbee, the current Fed president here in Chicago, called together a conference on daycare, which you might not think is a top economic issue, but it\u2019s a huge issue for labor force participation, upward mobility, standards of living for a lot of families. And so, the Fed wants to be a nexus of good conversation on topics like that. And then going back to what I said earlier about monetary policy, there is some feeling that the Fed somehow has policies of convenience. But the dedication that the Fed has to their mission is something that gets into those that work there very, very deeply. And I was quite surprised at how quickly the goal of facilitating a financial system and a set of economic conditions that are conducive to long-term economic performance got into me personally. It was very, very powerful. The four years that I was there were among the highlights of my career. Lefkovitz: So, Carl, you referenced that \u201clast mile problem\u201d and the Fed\u2019s seriousness with which it takes its goal of bringing inflation to 2%. Why do you think that the interest-rate hikes that we saw, the most dramatic in a generation, why do you think that they have not slowed the economy and brought down inflation to the extent that the economic textbooks maybe would have predicted? Tannenbaum: There are several factors that explain an apparent delay in the effectiveness of monetary policy. The first fall into the category of borrowers locking in the rates on their debt. You may remember that thanks to the easing that was done in 2020 and 2021, you have a number of Americans who have home mortgage rates of less than 4%. Perhaps you\u2019re one of them. And if you are, I suspect that your plans to move may be on a long-term hold. But the data are that while the mortgage rates in the marketplace have gone up, the mortgage payments made by households have not budged a lot. And so that has blunted to a certain degree the impact of higher rates on things like the housing industry. Secondly, partly under the blanket of a Fed guarantee in 2020, a lot of corporations, even those with not the highest ratings, were able to issue long-term debt at very favorable interest rates. And those don\u2019t really begin rolling over until the early part of next year. So, corporations have not had to face the high level of current market rates. And then finally, consumers also really were able to curtail their borrowing when they were receiving pandemic stimulus checks. And it\u2019s only been in the last 12 months that we\u2019ve seen, for example, credit card balances get back to levels that they held prior to the pandemic. So, you do gradually see households paying that higher interest rate, and that should have a bit more of a headwind effect on economic activity. Finally, for those who don\u2019t have debt, the higher interest rate has added to their incomes. Those who are invested in, let\u2019s say, cash or variable-rate bank products are getting much more in interest, and that\u2019s contributed to their spending. So, in some sense, there\u2019s an element of demand stimulation that\u2019s associated with monetary policy that is often overlooked. All of that said, as time goes on, I believe that the moves that the Fed has made will become more noticeable and potent. And they\u2019re factoring that into their decision as they contemplate whether the time is right for a pairing back just a little bit."

        "body": "Christine Benz: Hi, I\u2019m Christine Benz from Morningstar. The average person changes jobs 12 times in a lifetime, which means lots of 401(k) and IRA rollovers. Joining me to discuss how people can run into problems with rollovers is tax and IRA expert Ed Slott. He is just out with a new book called The Retirement Savings Time Bomb Ticks Louder. Ed, thank you so much for being here. Ed Slott: Great to be here. Benz: Ed, let\u2019s start by going through the steps that I need to take. Say I have a 401(k) with an old employer, I want to roll it over into an IRA. What are the things I need to do to make sure that I\u2019m dotting my i\u2019s and crossing my t\u2019s? Slott: All right. Let me get to the answer first, the solution, the spoiler at the end. Don\u2019t do rollovers. And by rollovers, I mean, when you take the money out, you take possession, you get a check and roll it over, say, to an IRA or IRA to IRA. Do only direct transfers. So, if you\u2019re coming out of a job, you do a direct transfer, if the company will let you do it, from your 401(k) right to your IRA without you touching the money in between. There was a famous football coach. I don\u2019t remember who it was, but I always mention it in programs because wherever I go, they always say it\u2019s their college coach who said it. It\u2019s a funny thing, wherever I go. And he said, in football, when you throw the ball, three things happen and two of them are bad. So, if you go to Ohio, \u201cOh, Woody Hayes said that.\u201d So, everybody says their guy said that. Well, if you do a rollover like I told you, called an indirect rollover because you\u2019re taking possession of the money, three things happen and they\u2019re all bad. If you do a rollover like I\u2019m talking about\u2014not a direct rollover, I gave you the solution first, why never to do these kinds of rollovers\u2014if you take money from a 401(k), take the check and want to roll it to your IRA, very common. Let\u2019s say you have $500,000. You\u2019ll only get $400,000. There\u2019s mandatory 20% withholding. So, they\u2019re going to give you a check for only $400,000. Now, you don\u2019t lose your money. That gets credit to your federal withholding tax because it\u2019s the law. But what if you don\u2019t have $100,000 to complete the rollover, then that\u2019s going to be taxable. If you do a direct transfer, that rule doesn\u2019t apply. You have the 60-day rollover rule. You have to complete these rollovers within 60 days. It sounds like a long time, but a lot of people miss the boat on this thing. You don\u2019t have to worry about 60 days if you would do a direct transfer. It happens instantaneously. And probably the worst one, the fatal error is when you move\u2014and this sounds so simple\u2014I want to move from one IRA to another. Nice and simple. That\u2019s a once per year\u2014it\u2019s called the once per year IRA rollover rule\u2014and that\u2019s the one that gets people. It\u2019s a fatal error. You lose your IRA because you\u2019re only allowed to do one per year, and that throws people. Because it\u2019s not really a year. It\u2019s not a calendar year. It\u2019s a fiscal year, 365 days. So, some people might say, \u201cWell, I know about the once per year rollover rule.\u201d So, I\u2019m going to roll over some in December. And then January is a new year.\u201d No. If you do a second rollover within the 365 days, you can\u2019t do it. It can\u2019t go in. It would be an excess contribution and results in more penalties. The whole thing is taxable. So, in my example, let\u2019s say the second one was the $500,000. All taxable. There\u2019s no fix. It\u2019s a fatal error, and the funds are no longer IRAs. It\u2019s over. So don\u2019t do once-per-year rollovers. So, there are cases on this all the time. But one big case that came out recently where it was a famous Hollywood guy and had these fancy attorneys and all this stuff. They blew every rule, every rollover rule. They were supposed to be Beverly Hills accountants or tax guys or attorneys. They not only blew every rule because they got assessed over a million dollars in penalties, they went to fight it in tax court, and they almost laughed them out of the court because these are black-and-white rules. They blew every rule. They created these arguments like one was on the 60-day rule. They blew that one. They said, \u201cWell, we want to claim you have over, actually over a year to do a 60-day rollover.\u201d There were more holes in their argument than Sonny Corleone. You know why I say that? Because it was Sonny Corleone. It was James Caan. Benz: Wow. Benz: In our programs, we show that clip. In The Godfather, we get shot full of holes and everything. We say, and that\u2019s not the worst thing that happened to him\u2014because then the IRS came in. Now, he has since died, and his estate had to pay over a million dollars in taxes and penalties because they broke the 60-day rule. They said they broke the once-per-year rule, but they probably could have got off on that because they didn\u2019t technically do it. But there\u2019s another rule called the same property rule. If you take money out of an IRA, it was some kind of a hedge fund, you have to return that to the new IRA. So, they couldn\u2019t do it because the new IRA wouldn\u2019t take it. So, they cashed it out and returned the cash. But even that was over a year late. They did everything wrong. So, they threw the book at them, and he never saw the end of it, but his beneficiaries got hit with over a million dollars of taxes. If they had just done a direct over everything, none of this would have happened. So, the idea is, don\u2019t fool around with this stuff. You get one chance. And the rule applies. The once per year, that\u2019s the fatal error, IRA to IRA, Roth IRA to Roth IRA. It does not apply, the once per year, that\u2019s why I call it the once per year IRA rollover rule, it doesn\u2019t apply when you move from a 401(k) to an IRA. That doesn\u2019t count as one. Or if you go back, like some people do, they have an IRA, they roll it back to a 401(k), that doesn\u2019t count as one. Or if you go from an IRA to a Roth IRA, that\u2019s a Roth conversion. That doesn\u2019t count as one. It\u2019s just IRA to IRA, Roth IRA to Roth IRA. But if you never want to worry about this, don\u2019t do these indirect or 60-day rollovers, because all these bad things can happen. People think 60 days is a lot, but there are all kinds of reasons, that one you could get out of. But why go through it? You could give an excuse. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about the 60 days\u201d or death, all these valid excuses, which IRS would extend the time. But why bother? Do direct transfers. Now, some people tell me, \u201cWell, when I\u2019m taking money from one IRA or from a company, they won\u2019t give me, they won\u2019t do a direct transfer.\u201d They don\u2019t have to. They will make a check out. Well, if you get a check made out to you, say you\u2019re Mary Smith, if I get a check made out to Mary Smith, that\u2019s constructive receipt. Now you\u2019re back in the bad kind of rollover, the 60-day rollover. If they will only make out a check, have the check made out to your receiving account, not Mary Smith\u2014the IRA of Mary Smith, because Mary Smith can\u2019t cash that check. That under the law counts as a direct trustee to trustee transfer, a direct rollover. And that\u2019s the only way to move money around from IRA to IRA, or 401(k) to IRA, any which way. If you do direct transfers, you\u2019ll never have to worry about any of this. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice? Benz: That would be nice. I wanted to ask about that direct trustee to trustee transfer. Does that avoid that 20% mandatory withholding? Slott: Yes. The 20% again is only from a plan like a 401(k) to IRA. There\u2019s no mandatory withholding IRA to IRA. Benz: Got it. Ed, it\u2019s always great to hear from you. Thanks for sharing your insights today. Slott: Thank you. Benz: Thanks for watching. I\u2019m Christine Benz from Morningstar.

        "body": "Thinking of changing how you invest based on how the November 2024 US presidential election will pan out? Think twice. The data on postelection stock market performance is mixed and gives neither party an obvious advantage. That\u2019s one possible conclusion from Morningstar\u2019s Markets Observer, a quarterly publication that draws on careful research and market insights. Other takeaways: The US market is still getting more concentrated at the top, emerging-markets equities have shown some life, and agency mortgage-backed bonds have looked more attractive to many fixed-income managers. Preston Caldwell, Morningstar\u2019s senior US economist, expects inflation to continue to normalize. Interested readers can download the full report here. Morningstar Direct and Office clients can also access the report on Direct Compass. A summary of key findings is available below. US large-cap equities once again led the way in 2024\u2032s second quarter amid continued artificial intelligence optimism and strong earnings results. The Morningstar US Large Cap Index gained 6.1% in the second quarter, beating the Morningstar US Small Cap Index\u2019s 3.6% decline. Outside the US, emerging-markets stocks weren\u2019t far behind, with the Morningstar Emerging Markets Index rising 5.2% as China bounced back and India continued to rally despite local election volatility. Emerging markets\u2019 strong showing propelled it ahead of the Morningstar Developed Markets ex US Index (which lost 0.8% in the quarter) for the trailing 12 months through June, though US stocks remained supreme over that period. Elsewhere, commodities remained up in the past year despite a selloff in June, while US bonds rose marginally. The US stock market is the most concentrated it has been in the 21st century when looking at the weight of the 10 largest stocks in the Morningstar US Market Index. As of June 2024, more than half this concentration came from three stocks: Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and Nvidia NVDA. While concentration has been trending higher for years, it spiked in 2020 and continued to reach new peaks recently amid AI optimism. We sorted the one-year and four-year returns for the S&P 500 index after Nov. 1 for the last 25 US presidential elections by winning party. Forward one-year returns were positive in 10 of 13 Democratic-won elections, compared with five of 12 Republican-won elections. Over forward four-year periods, returns were positive for Democrats in 11 of 12 instances; for Republicans, it was eight of 12. Since November 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won, the index was up 16.0% annualized through June 2024 (though he is not included on the below chart since he hasn\u2019t passed the four-year mark). While corporate credit spreads remain tight and unattractive, bond market volatility has provided relatively attractive opportunities in high quality, and now high-yielding, agency mortgage-backed securities. These bond prices were crushed in 2022, and many active core-bond managers found opportunities to shift their agency MBS exposure to an overweighting from an underweighting by trimming their corporate bond allocation. Asset managers are launching active exchange-traded funds in droves, and investors are following. Flows into active ETFs have left active mutual funds in the dust. Since 2008, through June 2024, active ETFs collected $569 billion, while active mutual funds lost $2.1 trillion. But active ETFs still have a ways to go because active mutual funds were the dominant choice for decades. Active ETFs account for just 2.3% of all US fund assets through the second quarter of 2024, a far cry from active mutual funds\u2019 46.2%. The interval fund market has surged in recent years in response to demand for products that allow regular investors ongoing access to investment strategies that historically were limited to institutional investors. Some of the world\u2019s largest active managers have entered the market, but the market is skewed toward its biggest players and still accounts for only a small percentage of pooled investment vehicle assets. For more information on interval funds, see Morningstar\u2019s June 2024 essential guide to interval funds. Core inflation peaked for most major economies in 2022 or early 2023 but has trended down in the year through June 2024. It\u2019s too early to declare victory, says Preston Caldwell, Morningstar\u2019s senior US economist, with core inflation still above central banks\u2019 2% targets and progress having slowed somewhat in 2024. Still, Caldwell expects inflation to normalize as supply disruptions are resolved and demand cools off. China could also transmit its low inflation to the rest of the world via expanded exports, but this could run afoul of protectionist backlash."

        "body": "In the five years since Avantis Investors opened, it\u2019s been in a sweet spot when drawing fund investors. Its lineup features actively managed exchange-traded funds at extremely low costs, which has helped it pull in about $38 billion in flows since its founding. The firm attracted the 10th-most flows of any fund family in June. The company\u2019s largest fund, the $13 billion Avantis US Small Cap Value ETF AVUV, has hauled in $2.4 billion in flows just this year. It\u2019s also Avantis\u2019 best ETF in terms of performance relative to its Morningstar category, ranking in the 4th percentile according to 3-year returns. Avantis is \u201ca lot cheaper than a lot of the actively managed stuff out there,\u201d says Daniel Sotiroff, a senior manager research analyst for Morningstar. In addition, \u201cthe relative predictability of their underlying strategies\u201d has helped bring in investors. Avantis, a division of American Century Investments, opened in 2019. It was by former employees of the $539 billion fund shop Dimensional Fund Advisors, including Eduardo Repetto, who had served as co-CEO and co-CIO at Dimensional, and Pat Keating, who had served as COO. Avantis now runs 37 active stock and bond funds, with $50 billion in assets. Like at Dimensional, these funds rely on quantitative models to pick holdings, similar to how strategic beta funds are constructed. Both firms also rebalance their portfolios in small increments throughout the year to minimize trading costs. This approach has been a big hit. Avantis\u2019 funds garnered over $1 billion from investors in their first seven months, and the cash flow has only grown from there. May 2022 was the firm\u2019s first month with over $1 billion in flows, and out of the 12 months ending in June, only two had flows under $1 billion. Over that period, the firm pulled in $15.5 billion, the 11th most flows of any fund family over the past 12 months. While both Avantis and Dimensional run cheap, actively managed funds that focus on systematic investing and have risen on the tides of these investing trends, Sotiroff sees two main differences. The first is that while both shops have an overall value tilt, Avantis starts with an initial screen for stocks \u201cthat are both cheap and profitable,\u201d often focusing on cash-flow-based measures of profit, as they can be less subject to accounting distortions. The element of profitability means \u201cin Avantis portfolios, you will actually end up holding some growth stocks.\u201d It picks stocks according to both the value and quality factors. The second is that while Dimensional uses a traditional price-to-book value ratio, Avantis looks at the book value minus \u201cintangibles\u201d\u2014non-physical assets like the value of brands, which are difficult to value precisely compared to something like a factory. For example, the Avantis US Small Cap Value ETF, the company\u2019s largest fund, has twice the average cash flow growth of the $3.5 billion Dimensional US Small Cap Value ETF DFSV (20.6% vs. 10.7%). Despite these differences (which Sotiroff says will likely be larger in more value-tilted funds), he thinks it\u2019s important not to overstate them: \u201cThe thing is, they\u2019re holding very broad portfolios, so at the end of the day, the signals kind of wash out. They\u2019re going after the same thing.\u201d Avantis was among the early adopters of actively managed ETFs, launching its first in 2019, the year an SEC rule change facilitated the easy creation of such funds. DFA made the move from running only traditional mutual funds in 2020. \u201cAvantis was kind of the first mover in that area,\u201d explains Sotiroff. The focus on active ETFs has come at the right time. Eight of the last nine years saw outflows from actively managed mutual funds and flows into active ETFs. This trend has accelerated, with $1.6 trillion flowing out of active mutual funds over 2022 and 2023. As of the end of June, active mutual funds (excluding money market funds) had a total of $13.3 trillion in assets. Flows for Avantis mirror this trend. All of its largest funds are ETFs, and of its funds\u2019 nearly $50 billion in assets, more than 90% is in its ETFs. It has nine traditional open-end funds, the largest of which is the $850 million Avantis US Small Cap Value Fund AVCNX. Another tailwind has been investors\u2019 continuing shift into low-cost funds. As of March of this year, the cheapest quintile of active ETFs holds $325 billion in assets, while the most expensive quintile holds just $35 billion. Avantis\u2019 funds have an average expense ratio of 21 basis points, far less than the 69-point average for active ETFs as a whole. While active ETFs have been gaining a disproportionate share of inflows\u2014growing from 2% of ETF assets in 2019 to 7% as of the end of March\u2014they aren\u2019t the same as many of the active mutual funds that have been hemorrhaging investor dollars. Out of the $382 billion in active equity ETFs, about $190 billion was in the systematic strategies of Dimensional and Avantis, while another $50 billion was in JPMorgan\u2019s options income funds, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI and JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ. Meanwhile, one of the best-known stock pickers in the active ETF space, Cathie Wood\u2019s $5.9 billion ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, saw $2 billion in outflows over the past year, the most of any active US stock ETF."

        "body": "Our analysts watch fund fundamentals like hawks. When they see significant improvement, they\u2019ll raise a fund\u2019s rating, and when they see deterioration, they will lower it. Today, I\u2019ll look at some of the biggest upgrades so far in 2024. We rate three pillars for funds: People, Process, and Parent. The Parent rating is done on a separate timetable from the individual fund ratings, but there\u2019s an interaction between them. Trends in individual fund ratings inform our Parent rating, and changes to that rating often inform our People and Process ratings. We upgraded this fund\u2019s Morningstar Medalist Rating two notches to Silver from Neutral by raising the People and Process ratings to High from Above Average. The fund has proved to be a very quiet but consistent performer. A good year means beating the index by 60 basis points or so. That\u2019s not exciting, but doing that most years results in a nice record. Lead manager Rick Figuly takes a bottom-up approach using the firm\u2019s deep team of analysts and managers. It\u2019s a very different mindset from the bold macro-driven funds we see at Western Asset or Pimco, but it certainly has its merits. We raised this fund\u2019s People rating to Above Average, taking the overall rating to Bronze from Neutral. Manager Shawn Driscoll just passed the two-year mark on this fund, but he had a solid record at T. Rowe Price New Era PRNEX over a longer time frame. Driscoll\u2019s emphasis on high-quality companies trading at modest multiples gives the fund a nice defensive side, as evidenced by its smaller loss in 2022. Driscoll incorporates a macroeconomic view into his portfolio construction, but he\u2019s not likely to stray from the fund\u2019s mild-mannered profile. We raised our Process rating to High on this fund, giving it a Gold rating overall. Lead manager Eric Mollenhauer has done a fine job since taking over in 2013, and newer additions Kevin Nielsen and Chandler Perine have brought more expertise to bear for the $14 billion fund. The fund has gradually moved from the cautious end of the peer group to one with a more typical profile, but it still has mostly BB and B rated debt from fairly liquid issues. The managers have directed that shift well, and their heft has given them an edge over peers that helps them get better access to the deals they want. We raised our People rating to High from Above Average as we\u2019ve been impressed by management and its depth of resources. That raised this fund\u2019s rating to Silver. The fund has three seasoned managers working with dedicated mortgage and securitized debt analysts. They adjust the portfolio based on their outlook for interest rates and yield-curve shifts. They\u2019ve succeeded in limiting losses in a hard-hit mortgage sector. We raised this fund\u2019s Process rating to Above Average from Average, taking its overall rating to Bronze from Neutral. The People Pillar remains Above Average. Lead manager Peter Santoro, who came over from Columbia in 2021, has dialed up the emphasis on cash flows rather than absolute yield, and that has allowed more healthcare and tech stocks into the portfolio. That makes the fund more diversified, which, of course, has helped in the recent growth rally. We recently raised this fund\u2019s Process rating to Above Average, and that raised the overall rating to Silver. The fund is run by two equal comanagers, Jason Weiner and Asher Anolic. That\u2019s rather unusual at Fidelity, but it has worked nicely. They begin with the excellent research done by Fidelity analysts and construct mental models to better understand companies. For example, they projected Uber\u2019s UBER business would act as expected by internet models and take market share from Lyft LYFT. This is a middle-of-the-road growth fund that has beaten peers over the managers\u2019 tenure but has lagged the Russell 1000 Growth Index. Foreign small-cap funds are a quirky bunch that tend to have uneven performance. Yet, within that group, this fund stands out as one of the best. We raised the fund\u2019s People rating to High to match its Process rating. That brought the overall rating to Gold. Longtime manager David Herro is still listed as a manager, but he has gradually handed more responsibility to Michael Manelli and Justin Hance. We\u2019ve been impressed by their work in building a fairly focused portfolio of appealing value stocks. They have long favored well-run industrials companies. Lately, the fund has beaten its benchmark and many peers, but in a rather volatile fashion, so you\u2019ll need a long-term outlook to get the most from the fund. We raised this fund\u2019s Process rating to High from Above Average, and that brought the overall rating up to Silver. Tom Murray and the fund\u2019s comanagers build a well-designed portfolio that delivers straightforward core exposure. The fund\u2019s risk-adjusted results have been quite appealing under Murray, and that flows from the emphasis on healthy balance sheets and management quality. The fund has often modestly outperformed its benchmark year to year. This article first appeared in the June 2024 issue of Morningstar FundInvestor.

        "body": "If you want to get yourself thoroughly depressed, spend a little time looking at statistics about Americans\u2019 retirement preparedness. Some of the data are hopeful. Recent research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, for example, indicates that seven out of 10 American workers feel confident in their ability to retire comfortably. Strong stock market returns no doubt help on that front. But that survey is about sentiment, and the actual data on retirement preparedness are more sobering. In Vanguard\u2019s most recent How America Saves report, the average participant balance in Vanguard plans was $134,000 in 2023, but the median balance was just $35,000. For workers with Vanguard plans who were between ages 55 and 64, the average and median balances were $245,000 and $88,000, respectively, in 2023. Roughly half of people between age 55 and 66 have no retirement savings at all, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, and women are in worse shape than men from the standpoint of retirement preparedness. Clearly, many people are hurtling toward a shortfall, or living through one. And for people who are dramatically undersaved and largely reliant on Social Security for in-retirement living expenses, there's no getting around the fact that their standard of living in retirement is going to be lower than it was when they were working. Many other workers have some retirement savings\u2014just not enough. I\u2019ve noticed that people in that position tend to adopt one of a handful of tactics. The first set is defeatist: \u201cMy kids will just have to take care of me.\u201d The second set is scrappy: \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep on working.\u201d The last group of people are looking to their investment portfolios to do the heavy lifting, hoping against hope that some combination of the right asset allocation and good investment picks will help make up for the shortfall. (\u201cIf I can just hit a home run with an investment or two \u2026\u201d) I\u2019d propose a fourth course of action. Rather than looking to a single blockbuster solution to help make up for a savings gap, what if you were to consider a little bit of several prudent strategies\u2014being willing to cut your standard of living a bit in retirement, working a bit longer, and investing a bit better, for example? The virtue of taking several small steps--rather than relying on a single Hail Mary action\u2014is that if one of the variables doesn\u2019t play out as you thought it would, you may still be able to save your plan. Employing more modest changes around the margins of your plan means they\u2019re apt to be more palatable from a lifestyle perspective, too; the thought of working until age 70 might not appeal but holding out until age 67 may be more doable. Before I get into a case study examining how several steps together can help put a plan on track, let\u2019s first run through the key variables that investors have to choose from if, based on their current savings and savings rates, it looks like there\u2019s a risk that their retirement assets will fall short. Remember, you don\u2019t necessarily need to embrace each of these, but implementing several of these tacks together can help bridge a shortfall. Using an estimate of your Social Security benefit, as well as a good basic savings calculator, you should be able to fiddle around with the variables to help assess the payoff that each one delivers. As preretirees have no doubt heard, working even a few years past traditional retirement age can deliver a threefer on the financial front, allowing additional savings and tax-deferred compounding, fewer years of portfolio drawdown, and perhaps delayed Social Security filing. Being willing to work part-time in retirement is another variation on this idea. Yet, as attractive as working longer looks by the numbers, it\u2019s a poor idea to make it the sole fallback plan, as many who plan to work longer are not able to. This is another exceptionally powerful lever, allowing individuals to pick up an increase in benefits for every year they delay Social Security filing beyond their full retirement ages up until age 70. In order to pull this off, however, an individual may need to work longer or draw from a portfolio earlier. The good news is that from a household budgetary standpoint, many individuals are best equipped to crank up their savings rates later in their careers. They\u2019re often in their peak earnings years, and other big-ticket preretirement expenses, such as home purchases and college funding, may be in the rearview mirror. The bad news is that with a shorter time horizon, those newly invested dollars will have less time to compound before they\u2019ll need to withdraw them; the tax benefits that one gets from using tax-advantaged retirement savings vehicles like IRAs and 401(k)s also matter less (especially for tax-deferred contributions that entail RMDs) later in life. That doesn\u2019t mean that late-start retirees shouldn\u2019t bother with additional contributions if they can swing them, though: Even an additional $5,000 invested per year, earning a modest average return of 4% for 10 years, would translate into more than $60,000 additional dollars in retirement. Generally speaking, people who earned higher incomes will have more wiggle room in lowering their in-retirement expenses than people with lower incomes. The simple reason is that the former group is apt to have more discretionary expenses--and therefore could do more belt-tightening\u2014than the latter group. Being willing to relocate to a cheaper home and/or a less-expensive location, while not for everyone, can deliver one of the biggest-ticket cost savings available to retirees. Many preretirees confronting a shortfall focus their energies here, and certainly, a portfolio with a heavier stock mix will tend to have a higher long-term return than a more conservative one. Yet, it\u2019s a mistake not to temper a preretirement portfolio\u2019s asset mix with safer investments. If a retiree\u2019s equity portfolio falls sharply in the first years of retirement, that can permanently impair the portfolio\u2019s ability to sustain itself over the retiree\u2019s time horizon. This one\u2019s a gimme. Lower mutual fund expenses are correlated with better returns, so why wouldn\u2019t you work to bring your portfolio\u2019s total costs down? Lowering costs can be particularly advantageous as you enlarge your portfolio\u2019s stake in safer investments like bonds, where absolute investment returns, while better today than just a few years ago, are apt to be relatively low. Moreover, the differential between very strong- and very poor-performing investments can boil down to expenses. Retirees seeking the same dollar amount, adjusted for inflation, year after year in retirement will generally want to be more conservative with their starting amount for portfolio withdrawals. Meanwhile, those who are willing to employ a dynamic withdrawal approach, varying withdrawals based on how their portfolios have performed, can generally take a higher starting withdrawal percentage, as illustrated in our team\u2019s annual retirement-spending research. To take a closer look at how adjusting a combination of the above variables can help bridge a retirement shortfall, let\u2019s consider a hypothetical 58-year-old preretiree, Cassie. Here are the particulars of her retirement situation: Tweaking Cassie\u2019s investment portfolio to improve its return potential is one idea, especially given that she\u2019s not retiring imminently. It would be a mistake to expect miracles on the return front, especially in the near term; I\u2019d strongly caution against employing heroic return assumptions of 7% or more or gunning for higher returns by taking the equity weighting over 75%. But by moving money out of cash, she may be able to nudge up her portfolio\u2019s long-term return potential a bit, from 5% to 6%. The other adjustments--increasing contributions, delaying retirement and Social Security, and employing a dynamic approach to portfolio withdrawals\u2014will require more sacrifices but do even more to help bridge Cassie\u2019s retirement shortfall. Her plan can come together if she: "

        "body": "Once, the tale goes, American workers relied upon a three-legged stool for their retirement income: 1) Social Security, 2) pensions, and 3) personal savings. That metaphor was always rickety, as even at their peak pensions covered less than half of private-sector workers. Today, that figure is 15%. (Government employees are another matter, although those with college educations pay for the pension privilege by receiving lower ongoing wages.) To switch analogies, the middle ground is vacant. Social Security provides subsistence for retirees, while personal savings contribute a risky supplement. Absent is an asset that lands between those extremes, supplementing Social Security benefits, but with relative safety. Insurance companies address the retirement income gap by selling fixed-rate annuity contracts that convert investment assets into guaranteed payments. The promises made by insurers are less ironclad than those from the US government, and the \u201cincome\u201d from fixed annuities (the quotes signify that such payments include the return of the owner\u2019s capital) is rarely adjusted for inflation. But without question, they are less risky than equities. So, you may ask, why does this column exist? Two reasons. To start, fixed annuities aren\u2019t typically used to prepare for retirement. They are wielded tactically rather than strategically, either as bond/cash substitutes (deferred annuities), hedged equities (indexed annuities), tax-protected investments (variable annuities), or as income-management tools for those who are already retired (immediate annuities). All young workers know about Social Security benefits and 401(k) plans. They are, however, unlikely to have heard of fixed-rate annuities. The bigger issue, though, is that investors aren\u2019t interested. Although the annuity industry\u2019s overall sales are healthy, relatively few buyers choose fixed-rate contracts, opting instead for riskier options that operate differently.. Insurers have had decades to furnish the third stool leg through fixed-rate annuities, but investors by and large have rejected their wares. The marketplace has rendered its verdict. Breaking down income annuities and savings annuities. You\u2019ll need to think through where to hold it, how much to annuitize, and when to make the buy. When to consider annuities rather than bonds. Lower risk has a high price. Watch: How to determine whether they should be a tool in your retirement-income toolbox. Maybe the problem rests not with the product itself but with its marketing. Annuities are notoriously complex. Almost nobody can explain the difference between deferred fixed, deferred variable, immediate fixed, variable, and fixed-index annuities. Even those who do understand struggle to explain all the contracts\u2019 optional features. Nor are the official documents much help. Go ahead: Read this 112-page prospectus. Somebody should, at least once. An alternative is to supply annuities through 401(k) plans, thereby making the companies do the research instead of the employees. As has been established by target-date funds, which are extremely popular within 401(k)s but scarcely held outside of them, a corporate stamp of approval greatly alleviates investor resistance. By moving within the workplace, products that have languished may at long last find their customer base. At least, that is the hope. The 401(k) industry has gradually been planning for that event. In 2019 and then again in 2022, Congress passed legislation that eased the regulatory burden for annuities within 401(k) plans. Consequently, some providers have begun to dip their toes into those waters. Three years ago, a consortium of companies founded Income America 5ForLIfe. This January, Fidelity went national with its pilot program, called Guaranteed Income Direct, while in May BlackRock BLK announced its LifePath Paycheck series. Each service operates differently. The Income America and LifePath Paycheck series bolt retirement-income options onto a target-date fund chassis, although not in an identical fashion. For its part, Fidelity\u2019s program does not supply new investments, but instead the possibility of annuitizing across the firm\u2019s existing fund lineup. As evidenced, 401(k) providers have not yet settled on a model for annuitization within the workplace as they have with target-date funds (which are very similar, particularly among the major players). Such experimentation will slow adoption, owing to buyer confusion, but ideally will lead to a stronger solution. Two notes. First, while personal annuities are often costly, workplace annuities will be relatively cheap thanks to competitive pressures. Second, because 401(k) plans by law must offer gender-neutral terms, workplace annuities are a particularly good deal for women, because they will receive the same annuity payments as men while having longer expected life spans. The answer depends on the direction of inflation. Easing the pain of achieving guaranteed income. A good investment idea, badly marketed. Businesspeople look to the marketplace, academics to the government. Each view has contributed one leg to the US retirement structure, with 401(k) plans invented and promulgated by capitalists while the Social Security system was inspired by university commentary. It is therefore no surprise that academics have proposed federal schemes. One of these I have previously discussed. In 2019, Nobel Laureate Richard Thaler recommended that 401(k) participants be permitted to convert some of their assets into additional Social Security credits. This concept prefigures BlackRock\u2019s product, with the critical differences being that: 1) the payments would be guaranteed by the US government rather than an insurance company, and 2) even better, they would be inflation-adjusted. While there is much to like about this proposal, it does contain a drawback that I overlooked in my 2019 article but was pointed out by another academic, The New School\u2019s Teresa Ghilarducci. Because most people who annuitize have above-average life spans, this scheme would weaken the Social Security Administration\u2019s finances by offering the standard payout rate to people who will collect more paychecks than their actuarial expectations. (Such is adverse selection.) Another Nobel Laureate\u2019s suggestion is already live. For several years, Robert Merton and a co-author, Arun Muralidhar, have suggested a product they call SeLFIES: Standard-of-Living indexed, Forward-starting, Income-only Securities. The name is awkward, but the service is sensible. Pay a given amount today, and receive government-guaranteed, inflation-adjusted future payments. Unlike most fixed-annuity products, SeLFIES targets investors of all ages. None of these suggestions bring new money to the table. Instead, they move assets from the savings leg of the stool to a leg that provides greater stability. In January 2023, Brazil debuted a modified version of SeLFIeS, called RendA+ bonds. Professor Merton reports that several other countries, including the US, are evaluating the results of that program. Of course, while Brazil was eager to reform its retirement system, progressing from concept to launch in less than four years, most nations will take far longer to reach a decision. None of these suggestions bring new money to the table. Instead, they move assets from the savings leg of the stool (represented in this article by 401(k) accounts, but of course they often include other sources) to a leg that provides greater stability. Such a trade-off is to be expected. After all, the same principle holds for pensions, which consume cash that at least in theory would otherwise go to salaries\u2014thereby increasing savings rates. Finally, this article is descriptive rather than prescriptive. It outlines the problem of the missing retirement leg and presents various potential solutions. But it only hints at their merits and/or drawbacks. For the moment, such evaluations are the readers\u2019 responsibility. Perhaps future columns will amend that omission."

        "body": "In theory, buying low-priced stocks seems to make sense. If a stock trades for less than, say, $10 per share, it\u2019s much easier for an investor to accumulate a meaningful position in a stock with relatively few dollars. The hope, of course, is that the position will explode in value over time, because small fluctuations in the stock price can result in sizable gains. In practice, however, buying low-priced stocks can be hazardous. The low-priced stock landscape is cluttered with untested upstarts, companies that have fallen on tough times run by managers who\u2019ve made poor capital decisions, and shaky balance sheets. Low-priced stocks are often thinly traded, which only adds to their volatility. And you can\u2019t have the potential for sizable gains without the other side of the coin: the potential for sizable losses. For investors nevertheless interested in buying low-priced stocks, we recommend sticking with higher-quality companies whose shares trade on major exchanges, are trading below $10, and are also undervalued relative to their intrinsic worth. Why? For starters, quality companies generally have better staying power and stronger balance sheets, and buying stocks below what they\u2019re worth helps to damp the price risk that often accompanies investing in low-priced stocks. The names on our list of the best cheap stocks to buy under $10 therefore share two qualities: These narrow- and wide-moat low-priced stocks all look undervalued, and their share prices were below $10 as of the market close on July 19, 2024. Here\u2019s a little bit about each of the best cheap stocks to buy under $10, along with some key Morningstar metrics. All data is through July 19. The cheapest stock on our list of the best stocks to buy below $10, Lithium Argentina is trading 87% below our fair value estimate of $25 per share. \u201cWe expect lithium demand to grow at nearly a 20% annual rate from over 900,000 metric tons in 2023 to over 2.5 million metric tons by 2030,\u201d says Morningstar strategist Seth Goldstein. Lithium Argentina is a pure-play lithium producer with two assets in Argentina. The company was created as a result of the former Lithium Americas separation, which separated the firm\u2019s Argentina and North America businesses. Cauchari-Olaroz is Lithium Argentina\u2019s first and largest project. The firm owns a 44.8% interest in the project, while Ganfeng, one of the world\u2019s largest lithium producers, owns 46.7%. The remaining 8.5% is owned by JEMSE, an Argentine state-owned mining company. The project recently entered production in 2023 and is in the process of ramping up production volumes to the project\u2019s first-phase annual capacity of 40,000 metric tons. Additionally, management is planning to begin construction on a second phase for at least an additional 20,000 metric tons of annual lithium capacity. On a cost basis, Cauchari-Olaroz will be one of the lowest-cost producers in the world and will have a cost position similar to that of other Argentine brine assets in operation. Lithium Argentina and Ganfeng are also developing a second resource in Argentina. This is in the Pastos Grandes basin, where Lithium Argentina and Ganfeng will likely combine three early-stage projects, which are directly adjacent to one another, into one single project. The three projects are Pastos Grandes, Sal de la Puna, and Pozuelos-Pastos Grandes. Lithium Argentina owns 85% of Pastos Grandes after selling a 15% stake to Ganfeng. Lithium Argentina also owns 65% of Sal de la Puna. Ganfeng owns the remaining stakes in the three projects. We forecast the single project to enter production early next decade and will likely have a low-cost position relative to the global cost curve but slightly higher than other Argentine brine projects, as early development studies indicate brine in the Pastos Grandes basin has a lower lithium concentration. As electric vehicle adoption increases, we expect durable double-digit annual growth for lithium demand. Lithium Argentina should benefit as there should be more than enough demand for the company\u2019s resources to enter production and expand capacity over time. The second lithium company on our list of the best cheap stocks to buy below $10, Arcadium Lithium stock looks 75% undervalued relative to our fair value estimate of $14 per share. Arcadium Lithium is a pure-play lithium producer created in the Livent-Allkem merger in early 2024. The company is a top-five lithium producer globally by capacity on a lithium carbonate equivalent basis. Arcadium\u2019s two lithium carbonate production resources in Argentina are among the world\u2019s lowest-cost lithium sources on an all-in-sustaining cost basis. As electric vehicle adoption increases, we expect high-double-digit annual growth for global lithium demand. Arcadium is looking to expand its Argentine brine-based lithium production capacity from around 40,000 metric tons per year in 2023 to 100,000 metric tons on a lithium carbonate equivalent basis by 2036. The growth will come from the expansion of its two existing resources, Fenix and Olaroz, and the development of the new brine resource, Sal de Vida. The company has a fourth Argentine brine resource at Cauchari that should progress through development and construction throughout the decade. Lithium carbonate is produced by pumping brine out of the ground (primarily in South America) or via pegmatite mining that produces spodumene, which is later converted to lithium carbonate. Lithium hydroxide can be produced either from the conversion of carbonate or directly from spodumene. Arcadium\u2019s strategy is to produce both hydroxide and carbonate. Hydroxide is a higher-quality and typically higher-priced product. Arcadium is one of the lowest-cost carbonate producers globally but has a higher-cost position in hydroxide because of the additional conversion cost. Fully integrated hydroxide producers that start with high-quality spodumene assets can produce hydroxide at a lower cost than Arcadium, but Arcadium\u2019s costs are still on the bottom half of the hydroxide cost curve. Arcadium also owns lithium hard rock resources. Mount Cattlin produces spodumene, a lithium concentrate that is sold to converters who make the battery chemicals. The company is also developing two hard rock resources in Canada to expand its spodumene volumes over time. Arcadium plans to build spodumene processing capacity to fully integrate some of its spodumene production while continuing to sell the remaining spodumene to converters. Altice USA stock is undervalued, trading 75% below our $7 fair value estimate. Although the small company earns a narrow economic moat rating based on its efficient scale and cost advantage versus its rivals, we\u2019ve assigned the stock a Very High Uncertainty Rating because of the company\u2019s heavy debt load relative to its peers. Altice USA has struggled to maintain revenue growth recently\u2014more than cable peers Comcast and Charter\u2014as it battles stiff competition from Verizon in the New York market and faces the broader incursion of fixed-wireless players into the broadband business. The firm has also taken a different approach to the business in recent years than other cable operators, with lackluster results. A new management team, largely hailing from Comcast, has slowly been improving the firm\u2019s performance. We expect the firm\u2019s networks will remain vital pieces of infrastructure that will generate strong, albeit slow-growing, cash flow over the long term. However, Altice USA also carries a very large debt load, leaving it little room for error. Around 60% of Altice\u2019s business is in the New York metro area, where favorable demographics have historically enabled the firm to claim high customer penetration rates and revenue per customer. The market is also far more competitive than average, though, as Altice faces competition from Verizon\u2019s Fios network across more than half the territory. Altice is upgrading its network in Fios areas to fiber, eliminating any network advantage Verizon enjoys, but this effort hasn't paid off yet in terms of better customer or revenue growth. The rest of Altice\u2019s territory covers mostly smaller markets and rural areas where demographics aren\u2019t as favorable but fiber network competition is also more limited. Like its cable peers, Altice has used its network advantage to steadily increase data speeds in recent years and claim more than half the internet access market in the territories it serves, providing a solid foundation for the business. However, missteps by the prior management team and the introduction of fixed-wireless broadband offerings from Verizon and T-Mobile have weighed heavily on Altice's ability to attract and retain customers. We believe the firm is taking appropriate steps to improve execution and that fixed-wireless growth will slow sharply in the coming quarters. Showing progress over the next few quarters is vital to regaining the confidence of the bond market to limit borrowing costs and maximize strategic flexibility. Hanesbrands stock looks 66% undervalued, according to our metrics. Hanes\u2019 key apparel brands have leading market shares in their categories in the United States, which helps the company earn a narrow economic moat rating. The company recently announced plans to sell its Champion brand. Morningstar senior analyst David Swartz says the move will allow the company to pay down debt and focus on its core innerwear brands. Narrow-moat Hanesbrands is the market leader in basic innerwear in multiple countries. We believe its key innerwear brands like Hanes and Bonds (in Australia) achieve premium pricing. While the firm faces challenges from inflation, slowing demand for apparel, higher interest rates, and a highly competitive athleisure market, we think Hanes\u2019 share leadership in replenishment apparel categories puts it in position for improving results in the coming years. In May 2021, the firm unveiled its Full Potential plan to bring growth back to innerwear, improve connections to consumers (through greater marketing and enhanced e-commerce, for example), and streamline its portfolio. In June 2024, Hanes agreed to sell Champion to Authentic Brands Group. As Champion\u2019s sales have been disappointing, Hanes\u2019 management made the prudent decision to sell the brand to focus on its core basics. The proceeds, which could exceed $1 billion after taxes and other costs, should allow for faster debt reduction. One of Hanes\u2019 major initiatives is to improve the efficiency of its supply chain. It has already made progress in this area, having achieved a 15% increase in manufacturing output over the past five years. The company, unlike many rivals, primarily operates its own manufacturing facilities. More than 70% of the more than 2 billion apparel units sold by the firm each year are manufactured in its own plants or those of dedicated contractors. We believe the combination of strong pricing, new merchandise, and production efficiencies should allow Hanes to return to operating margins above 20% for its American innerwear business by 2026. Bayer is the only drugmaker on our list of the best low-priced stocks to buy; it\u2019s also one of the larger companies on our list. We think the market is overly concerned about litigation pressures and underappreciates the firm\u2019s cost-cutting plan and growth potential from innovative products, argues Morningstar director Damien Conover. Bayer stock trades 62% below our fair value estimate of $18.50 per share. Largely on the basis of the strong competitive advantages of the healthcare group and to a lesser extent the crop science business, we believe Bayer has created a narrow economic moat. Bayer is evaluating the divestitures of the crop science and consumer healthcare businesses, which appear to hold few synergies with the prescription drug business. In the healthcare division, Bayer\u2019s strong lineup of recently launched drugs and solid exposure to biologics should support steady long-term cash flows. Bayer\u2019s hemophilia franchise and key ophthalmology drug Eylea are biologics. While competition is increasing in hemophilia and eyecare, the manufacturing complexity of these drugs helps to deter generic pressure. Also, new formulations of Eylea and hemophilia drugs hold the potential to keep competition at bay. Further, strong demand for cardiovascular drug Xarelto should continue to drive growth, but the drug\u2019s key 2026 patent loss will likely create growth headwinds. Bayer's healthcare segment also includes a consumer healthcare business with leading brands Aspirin and Aleve. Brand recognition is key in this unit, as evidenced by the company's iconic Aspirin, which continues to post strong sales even after decades of generic competition. In addition to healthcare, Bayer runs a leading crop science segment, which includes crop protection products (pesticides, herbicides, fungicides) and the fast-growing plant and seed biotechnology business. Similar to the drug business, this segment is research and development intensive, and Bayer has developed a strong portfolio of products. The downside to this business is that demand is heavily dictated by weather and commodity prices, which will determine how much farmers can afford to spend on crop treatment. The acquisition of Monsanto has significantly expanded Bayer\u2019s competitive position in this industry. On the negative side, the acquisition increased Bayer\u2019s exposure to litigation around potential side effects from glyphosate use. While many studies have shown glyphosate use to be safe, some reports of linkage to cancer drove large class-action legal cases against Bayer and led to a legal settlement of over $15 billion. The only luxury goods company on our list of the best cheap stocks to buy below $10, Swatch Group stock trades 53% below our $21.30 fair value estimate. The company\u2019s pricing power helps underpin its narrow economic moat rating, explains Morningstar senior analyst Jelena Sokolova. First-half 2024 results have been weak because of sales declines in China, but we think this undervalued stock should appeal to patient, long-term investors, she adds. The Swatch Group is the biggest vertically integrated Swiss watch manufacturer with 18 brands covering all price ranges, from entry to ultraluxury. Swatch-owned brands account for around 35% of Swiss watch exports, and the company supplies competitors with watch movements. Swatch Group\u2019s luxury brands boast 100- to 200-year histories, iconic collections, and deep cultural heritage. Most of Swatch\u2019s brands (at price points below $10,000) benefit from a cost advantage through scale and a higher degree of production automation. Swatch\u2019s diversification in terms of brands and price points helps it to avoid the pitfalls that come with extending brands into categories where they don\u2019t strategically belong and to potentially capture a positive mix as consumers trade up. However, we see a lack of control over distribution (a little less than 60% of sales are wholesale) as a weak spot for the company. Distributors are more likely to engage in discounting to maintain cash flows when demand sours, which we believe can be damaging for brands with long-shelf-life products. We believe that the demand for high-end watches is not structurally impaired (around 50% of revenue), branded jewelry offers attractive upside for growth (around 9% of revenue from the Harry Winston brand), while lower-priced watches (less than 20% of sales) are stabilizing and growing from a low base as the smartwatch category matures and innovation provides a boost. The company is increasingly taking action to tackle costs in the low-end brands and limit grey market channels for high-end brands while investments in automation should help achieve higher profitability even with lower volumes. We expect Swatch Group\u2019s sales to grow at a 4% pace over the long term (versus low-single-digit growth over the prior decade) with mid-single-digit growth for its higher-priced watch brands such as Omega, Longines, Breguet, and Blancpain, high-single-digit growth for jewelry brand Harry Winston, and low-single-digit growth for low-end watches (Tissot, Swatch, Mido, Hamilton, and so on). Melco Resorts and Entertainment stock looks 47% undervalued. We think the company maintains a narrow economic moat; it is only one of six primary concessionaries with a casino license in Macao (the only legal gaming hub in China), which is a valuable intangible asset that has a high regulatory barrier to entry, explains Morningstar senior analyst Jennifer Song. We think the stock is worth $11.60 per share. We believe the gambling market in Macao will enjoy solid growth in the longer term. This structural tailwind is driven by the rising middle class in China and the penetration rate of less than 2% in Macao, compared with Las Vegas\u2019 13%. New hotel rooms by major operators in the next few years should accommodate increased and extended visits from bigger spenders from these provinces and drive the top line for integrated resort operators like Galaxy Entertainment. With the gradual ramp-up of traffic allowed on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge, the new Hengqin border, and the Gongbei-to-Hengqin extension rail, Macao\u2019s carrying capacity for tourists should increase. In addition, neighboring Hengqin Island, 3 times the size of Macao, is under rapid development to complement Macao\u2019s growth. As one of only six concession holders to operate casinos in Macao, Melco Resorts & Entertainment is ideally placed to benefit from this market dynamic, given its portfolio of properties catering to both mass-market and premium patrons. We think the firm\u2019s strength in the premium mass segment and its leadership in product innovation, along with the launch of Studio City phase 2 in 2023 with 900 rooms, will drive a meaningful market share gain in midcycle. Here\u2019s the new list of Morningstar\u2019s top underpriced analyst picks to buy for the third quarter of 2024. These dividend stocks to buy offer attractive yields at cheap prices. Cheap high-quality names from the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index are attractive stocks to buy for long-term investors. The only wide-moat stock on our list of the best cheap stocks to buy below $10, Ambev stock trades 41% below our $3.60 fair value estimate. The largest brewer in Latin America, Ambev benefits from both a cost advantage and intangible assets in its strongest markets and therefore earns a wide economic moat rating, explains Morningstar director Ioannis Pontikis. Brahma, the Brazilian brewer, was the first foray into the consumer product manufacturing industry by private equity group 3G. In 2000, 3G merged two Brazilian brewers; Brahma and Antarctica, creating Ambev. The company has gone on to roll up brewers throughout Central and South America and holds several monopolylike positions in large markets, including an 81% volume share in Argentina, 68% in Brazil, and 61% in Peru. In part because of the favorable industry structures, and in part because of its 3G heritage, Ambev is a highly profitable business. The company has a well-entrenched cultural focus on cost management, and implemented zero-based budgeting over a decade ago. Ambev\u2019s largest market is Brazil, which represented 54% of total beverage net revenue and 49% of EBIT in 2022. However, until coronavirus-related social distancing measures prompted the closure of on-trade in some markets, Ambev's beer EBIT margin in Brazil had been in the mid-30% range, among the highest in the global beer industry, though it had faded from above 40% a decade ago. In 2022, that margin troughed at under 21% but recovered somewhat to just under 23% in 2023. We believe rebuilding margins is important to the investment case. In our view, the most likely and significant boost to profitability would be a reversion to the historical mean of commodity costs. We estimate the company faced around BRL 3 billion in higher raw material costs in 2022, and a reversal of that by the end of 2024 would increase the gross margin by 3 percentage points, all else equal. In practice, we anticipate that some of the cost relief will be passed to the consumer, but lower costs will be beneficial to margins to a large degree. Premiumization should be a long-term growth and margin driver. According to Euromonitor, the premium beer segment represented 16% of Brazil\u2019s beer volume in 2022, around half of that of the US, and was responsible for most of the industry volume growth between 2016 and 2022. Ambev\u2019s portfolio of local premium brands, as well as its access to Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s global portfolio, positions it to benefit from a strong mix effect in the medium term. Sabre stock is 35% undervalued relative to our fair value estimate of $5 per share. The only tech stock on our list of the best cheap stocks to buy under $10, Sabre is seeing improving demand and profits as business and international travel rebound following the coronavirus pandemic, reports Morningstar senior analyst Dan Wasiolek. Despite near-term financing costs and long-term corporate travel demand uncertainty, we expect Sabre to maintain its position in global distribution systems, or GDS, over the next 10 years, driven by a leading network of airline content and travel agency customers as well as its solid position in technology solutions for these carriers and agents. Sabre\u2019s 30%-plus GDS air transaction share is the second largest of the three companies (behind narrow-moat Amadeus AMADY and ahead of privately held Travelport) that together control about 100% of market volume. Sabre is also a leader in providing technology solutions to travel suppliers. Sabre's GDS enjoys a network advantage, which is the source of its narrow moat rating. As more supplier content (predominantly airline content) is added, more travel agents use the platform, and as more travel agents use the platform, suppliers offer more content. This network advantage is solidified by technology that integrates GDS content with back-office operations of agents and IT solutions of suppliers, leading to more accurate information that is also easier to book. The company's platform reach should grow as Sabre continues to revitalize its technology and looks to expand with low-cost carriers and in countries where it previously had only minimal penetration, which are also markets with higher yields than the consolidated North American region. Replicating Sabre\u2019s GDS platform would entail aggregating and connecting content from several hundred airlines to a platform that is also connected to travel agents, which requires significant costs and time. Although we see GDS aggregation, processing, and back-office advantages as substantial, technology architectures like those of Etraveli enable end users to access not only GDS content but also supply from competing platforms, which could take some volume from companies like Sabre. Also, GDS faces some risk of larger carriers making direct connections with larger agencies, although we expect these relationships to be the exception rather than the rule and for Sabre to still be the aggregating platform in either case. Rounding out our list of the best cheap stocks to buy under $10, Sirius XM trades 32% below our fair value estimate of $5 per share. The company earns a narrow economic moat rating largely because of the cost advantage of its satellite radio service. Sirius XM Holdings consists of two businesses: SiriusXM and Pandora. SiriusXM transmits music, talk shows, sports, and news via its satellite radio network, primarily to consumers who pay a subscription fee, often tied to a vehicle. Its radios come preinstalled on a wide range of cars and trucks in the US. Most of the stations on the SiriusXM network are proprietary, differentiating the service from streaming music and terrestrial radio. Most new cars with SiriusXM radios come with a 3- to 12-month trial period for the service. The conversion to self-pay after the trial is 37%, which represents the majority of new paid subscriptions. These customers have a monthly churn of 1.6%, implying a customer life of around five years. SiriusXM shares some of the revenue from self-pay customers with the automakers in the form of loyalty payments. Over the next five years, we expect that the satellite service will continue to expand, albeit slowly, by converting enough new- and used-car owners to self-pay to offset churn losses and by discounting the prices of subscriptions to retain customers. Pandora, acquired in February 2019, is a streaming music platform that offers an ad-supported radio option and a paid on-demand service. Pandora still generates most of its revenue via advertising to consumers of its \u201cradio\u201d service, who listened to over 10.5 billion hours in 2023. The paid on-demand service only had 6 million paid subscribers in the US at the end of 2023, representing 4.5% of the estimated 133 million paid music service subscribers in the country, according to eMarketer. Pandora moved into podcasting to differentiate its offering, but larger competitors like Spotify have already added podcasts to their services. As a result, the space has become increasingly crowded, and we don\u2019t expect the move to generate significant growth or returns. We project that while Pandora will slowly expand its subscriber base over the next five years, the segment will continue to lose money as royalty payments will remain a drag on operating income. Morningstar thinks that companies with economic moats possess significant advantages that allow them to successfully fend off competitors for a decade or more. Companies can carve out their economic moats in a variety of different ways\u2014by having high switching costs, through strong brand identities, or by possessing economies of scale, to name just a few. Companies that we think can maintain their competitive advantages for at least 10 years earn narrow economic moat ratings; those we think can successfully compete for 20 years or longer earn wide economic moat ratings. The Morningstar fair value estimate represents what Morningstar analysts think a particular stock is worth. Fair value estimates are rooted in the fundamentals and based on how much cash we think a company can generate in the future, not on fleeting metrics such as recent earnings or current stock price momentum. Though they may sound alike and are often used interchangeably, undervalued stocks and low-priced stocks usually mean two different things. Undervalued stocks are stocks that are trading below some estimate of their worth; these stocks are often also called \u201ccheap stocks.\u201d In Morningstar\u2019s terms, undervalued stocks are those that trade below Morningstar\u2019s fair value estimates. But cheap stocks can also be those stocks with low price/earnings, price/book, or price/sales multiples. Think of them as stocks on sale. Low-priced stocks, meanwhile, are typically stocks whose share prices fall below a particular dollar amount. In this article, we\u2019re focusing on low-priced stocks with share prices below $10, for instance. Others may consider stocks trading below $5 or $25 to be low-priced stocks. For purposes of this article, just remember: Not all low-priced stocks are undervalued, and not all undervalued stocks are low-priced. This article focused on low-priced stocks trading below $10 that were undervalued from companies with economic moats. But the screening method used here certainly isn\u2019t the only way to find cheap low-priced stocks to investigate further. Investors can create their own list of undervalued low-priced stocks using the Morningstar Investor Screener. Beneath Investment Type, choose Stocks. Beneath Valuation, check both Price/Fair Value 0\u20140.5 and 0.5\u20141.0. Then, click on the cog in the results and use the search box to find Previous Close Price. Add that metric to your Columns list and hit the Update button. You now have a complete list of stocks that are undervalued by Morningstar\u2019s price/fair value metric that you can sort based on the last close price. That will allow you to find stocks that are trading below $5, or below $25, or whatever price you consider to be low-priced."

        "body": "Index funds are passive investments. They track an index with the aim of replicating that index\u2019s performance minus expenses. Active funds, meanwhile, are led by managers who choose particular securities in an effort to outperform an index. However, some index funds are better than others. The best index funds do a good job of closely tracking their indexes, minimizing costs, and following sensible rules-based indexes. The first index fund, Vanguard 500, debuted in 1976. Since then, funds that index the US stock market have exploded in popularity. And index funds that focus on international stocks and bonds are becoming more popular, too. Why? Many argue that buying and holding the broad market (whatever that market may be) generates better results than trying to beat that same market through actively selecting securities. Indeed, Morningstar research has confirmed that in many investment categories, index funds have outperformed active funds over time. A good place to start your search for top index exchange-traded funds and mutual funds is with the Morningstar Medalist Rating. Funds that earn our highest rating\u2014Gold\u2014are those that we think are most likely to outperform over a full market cycle. Here\u2019s the list of best low-cost index mutual funds and ETFs for 2024, which is broken down by the three main asset classes that are represented in many investors\u2019 portfolios: US stocks, international stocks, and bonds. We\u2019re also including a list of what we\u2019re calling \u201cspecialized\u201d index funds, which features top-rated low-cost index funds from investment categories that appear less frequently in the portfolios of most investors. These mutual funds and ETFs all land in one of the broad US stock Morningstar Categories, earn the top Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold, and have Analyst Assigned % equaling at least 80% as of July 24, 2024. Although this is a list of the best broad-based low-cost index funds investing in US stocks, there is some variety here. Several funds in the group track the S&P 500 and therefore provide access to large-cap stocks representing about 80% of the US stock market. Other index funds on the list follow much broader market indexes that include more stocks, some of which are smaller-cap names. Meanwhile, other funds on the list are more narrowly focused, tracking indexes based on market capitalization (mid- or small-cap stocks) or investment style (growth stocks or value stocks). To fully understand a fund\u2019s strategy, be sure to read its Morningstar Fund Analyst Report. These mutual funds and ETFs all land in one of the broad international stock categories, earn the top Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold, and have Analyst Assigned % equaling at least 80% as of July 24, 2024. Here, too, we have another list of the best broad-based low-cost index funds\u2014in this case, focused on international stocks\u2014where there is some variety. Some funds here track global indexes that include US stocks; others follow global indexes that exclude US stocks. Consult the investment\u2019s Analyst Report for more details. These mutual funds and ETFs all land in one of the broad bond categories, earn the top Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold, and have Analyst Assigned % equaling at least 80% as of July 24, 2024. Several of the best broad-based index funds on this list land in one of the intermediate-term bond categories. As such, they\u2019d make great choices to anchor the bond portion of an investor\u2019s portfolio, assuming the goals for the money are six or more years away. Those saving for a shorter-term goal in the next three to five years might consider short-term bond funds instead. Those investors with longer time horizons might consider a longer-term bond fund\u2014but they should also be prepared for the enhanced volatility that comes with investing in long-term bonds. These mutual funds and ETFs all land in one of the specialized stock or bond categories, earn the top Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold, and have Analyst Assigned % equaling at least 80% as of July 24, 2024. The top-rated mutual funds and ETFs on this list are good choices for investors looking to fill more niche roles in their portfolios. For instance, retirees often hold a fund that\u2019s meant to blunt the impact of inflation on their portfolios; two funds on this list are designed to do just that. Any historical performance advantage aside, there are several benefits to investing in index funds. Investors can access passive strategies through two different investment products: mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. One product isn\u2019t better than the other; choosing the right wrapper depends on personal preferences. Investors who value trading flexibility or who may have few dollars to invest might prefer an ETF, while those accessing index funds via a company-sponsored retirement plan are more than likely buying mutual funds. Read \u201cCage Match: Traditional Index Funds vs. ETFs\u201d to learn more about the differences between mutual funds and ETFs. Of course, focusing on funds that earn a Gold rating may be too limiting for some investors. Those who\u2019d like to consider funds beyond our top rating can review a full list of US stock index funds and ETFs and bond index funds and ETFs that earn ratings of Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Investors can also review complete lists of all index mutual funds or all index ETFs. These lists include funds that don\u2019t currently earn Medalist Ratings. These bond ETFs and mutual funds earn Morningstar\u2019s top rating. These dividend ETFs and mutual funds earn high ratings from Morningstar. These growth stock mutual funds and ETFs earn top ratings from Morningstar. These international mutual funds and ETFs all earn Morningstar Medalist Ratings of Gold. These mutual funds and ETFs focus on small-company stocks and earn Morningstar Medalist Ratings of Gold. These top-rated mutual funds and ETFs make excellent long-term core holdings. These mutual funds and ETFs invest in value stocks and earn top ratings from Morningstar. These top-rated Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds are excellent choices to buy and hold in 2024 and beyond. "

Morningstar\u2019s research team has been adding stocks to its coverage list\u2014which means more stock ideas for investors to consider. Today, we\u2019re looking at two companies that are new to coverage and that earn wide economic moat ratings. How does Morningstar decide which stocks its analysts will cover? Our coverage tilts toward larger companies that are of most interest to investors. Our analysts also cover a fair representation of names in each industry and include interesting mid- and small-size companies, too. Our analysts perform a discounted cash flow analysis to arrive at what we call a fair value estimate for what a company\u2019s stock is worth. They\u2019ll also dig into a company\u2019s competitive advantages, and those companies in superior business positions will be awarded a wide economic moat rating. Now, let\u2019s talk about the two new wide-moat companies. The first new wide-moat stock to consider is GE HealthCare Technologies, which was spun off from GE in 2023. GE HealthCare is a leading medical technology firm in imaging and ultrasound equipment. With a firmly established foothold in hospitals and health networks around the world, the company stands to benefit from long-term healthcare trends that include aging populations, the growing demand for early detection of cancer and other diseases, and increasing utilization of minimally invasive and noninvasive procedures. We think the company has carved out a wide economic moat, thanks to intangible assets and switching costs in its imaging and ultrasound segments. We project revenue to grow at low- to midsingle digits over the next 20 years, and we think shares are worth $98. The second new wide-moat stock to consider is Bio-Rad Laboratories. Bio-Rad is a small company that we think has managed to carve out a wide economic moat in the medical-devices industry. The company is the leader in many of its niche products and solutions for the life sciences research and clinical diagnostic markets. While current market strength doesn\u2019t guarantee future market leadership, the diagnostic and life sciences markets tend to favor strong incumbents, because the complexity of instruments and analysis creates loyal user bases. We forecast revenue growth in the low- to midsingle digits for the next 15 years, and we think Bio-Rad\u2019s stock is worth $430 per share.

        "author": "Jessica Bebel",
        "body": "On this episode of The Long View, author and financial educator Brian Feroldi breaks down individual stock investing, how valuation plays a role, and how interest rates affect stock market returns. Here are a few excerpts from Feroldi\u2019s conversation with Morningstar\u2019s Christine Benz and Amy Arnott. Amy Arnott: You mentioned that some of your biggest personal mistakes have been selling too early. But what role do you think valuation should play in the process for buying individual stocks? And are there certain valuation metrics that you like to look at? Brian Feroldi: Valuation is a really tricky thing for investors to understand and to wrap their heads around. Moreover, if you just think through what has happened at the geopolitical level or at the very macro level in the United States over the last 20 years, interest rates have a big impact on the way that stocks are valued. From 2009 all the way up until pretty much 2022, interest rates in the United States were effectively zero. And when the cost of borrowing is effectively zero, that can really warp the way that stocks should be valued. So, for me personally, from the period of 2009 until 2022, the lesson that the market taught investors was to deemphasize valuation. And when the interest rates were set at zero, that lesson came through loud and clear where the thing that mattered most was the quality of the business and growth of earnings, and the valuation you paid mattered less. Now that we\u2019re in a more normalized\u2014and I put that in air quotes, \u201cnormalized\u201d\u2014interest-rate environment, interest rates have returned to near the historic norms, valuation has retaken its role as being a very important thing that investors should pay attention to. So, for many years, valuation was deemphasized as part of my investing process. Now with interest rates normalized, it is more emphasized. When it comes to valuing businesses, one of the biggest mistakes that I made historically was I didn\u2019t use the right valuation metric at the right time. So, companies go through different phases in their growth cycle. There\u2019s an early startup phase, there\u2019s a high-growth phase, there\u2019s a shareholder-return phase, and there\u2019s a decline phase. And which valuation method you should use depends heavily on which stage the company is currently in. So, if a company is big and mature in the shareholder-return phase, it\u2019s got a wide moat, I think very common valuation metrics, such as price/earnings ratio, price/free cash flow ratio\u2014those metrics make a lot of sense for valuing companies in that stage. However, if a company is earlier in its development, you have to use very different metrics such as the price/sales ratio or the enterprise value/total addressable market ratio, or other simplified metrics simply because the company isn\u2019t yet optimized for earnings. So again, a big mistake that I made early in my investing career, I didn\u2019t understand that you should use different valuation tools at different times, but now I do. Christine Benz: We have a lot more questions about valuation and you\u2019ve written a lot about valuation, but I wanted to follow up on your comment about interest rates and their role in all of this. When growth stocks fell in 2022, that slide was widely ascribed to rising rates and the implications for growth companies\u2019 distant cash flows. But more recently, some market watchers have argued that value companies, especially smaller companies, are more vulnerable to rising rates because they tend to be more highly leveraged, so they are most affected by higher rates. So, which of these narratives is correct when thinking about the role of interest rates in affecting stock market returns? Feroldi: That\u2019s an interesting question. And it\u2019s generally a very tricky question. I think that both narratives do have elements of truth to them. If you think about companies that do have a lot of debt on their balance sheet that are very highly leveraged, in other words, those companies are clearly paying interest\u2014they take a portion of their operating income and use it to pay off the interest that they have. Well, the higher interest rates go, the more that debt becomes a burden on those companies\u2019 earnings because they have to use a bigger and bigger portion of their operating income simply to cover their interest payments. So, it makes sense to me that rising interest rates would really hurt those companies that aren\u2019t very highly leveraged simply because their cost of capital was going up so dramatically. On the flip side, when you think about very high-growth companies, companies that are, say, in the software-as-a-service space, growing 50% per year, a lot of those companies are valued very, very highly and a big portion of their current value is on the assumption that their growth will continue into the future and that a lot of their cash flows that they\u2019re going to be generating are five, 10, 15 years out. So as interest rates rise, that causes the discount rate on those future cash flows to be raised. That in turn dramatically impacts the current price that investors should pay for those stocks given that the discount rate on those future cash flows has gone up. So, I would argue that rising interest rates have hit both companies, very highly valued stocks that have their cash flows in the future and companies that have high debt levels. So, it makes sense to me that both categories have seen their share prices decline given interest rates have gone higher. Arnott: Sticking with the theme of valuation, you recently made the case that Nvidia NVDA, in your opinion, isn\u2019t terribly overvalued, although you\u2019ve also conceded the stock might not be cheap, either. Can you run us through some of the key metrics that you would look at to make that assessment? Feroldi: What has happened to Nvidia over the last two years has been nothing short of remarkable. I can\u2019t remember the last time that a company that was already big\u2014and Nvidia had a market cap that was over $100 billion\u2014then went to dramatically, dramatically grow its revenue, its margins, and its profits so much that its stock price has just exploded. And meanwhile, the valuation on a trailing basis does look insanely expensive. However, if in the denominator of your multiples, you look at the forward price/earnings ratio for Nvidia, which incorporates that growth, that extreme growth into it, Nvidia might not be as expensive as it first appears on paper. So, this is why valuation can be so tricky and can trip up so many investors because many people, myself included, are taught from the get-go that price/earnings ratio is the ultimate measure of valuing a business. And if you look at Nvidia\u2019s price/earnings ratio, just last year, it was over 100, even over 200, at some points during the year. And there\u2019s no way that a rational person would look at that price/earnings ratio on a trailing basis over 200 and say, \u201cWell, this stock is a buy.\u201d That just defies conventional thinking. However, if you bought Nvidia stock, even at those very high price/earnings ratios, you have earned multiples on your initial investment. The reason is the E, the earnings in that equation for Nvidia, has gone up far more on a percentage basis than the stock price has. This is a great example of why valuing companies can be so tricky and why using traditional valuation metrics, such as the price/earnings ratio, really has a ton of nuance to it. Because it\u2019s not just the price/earnings ratio in absolute terms that you can use to determine if a company is cheap or expensive. It is the direction and magnitude of the increase or change in the company\u2019s earnings that dictates where a stock price can head. Sometimes stocks can go up, their price can increase, and their valuation can be lower in the future simply because their earnings have gone up more. The inverse is also true. Sometimes stocks can fall 50% and their stocks can be more expensive if their earnings are falling by more than 50% during that time. So, valuation is tricky in general, but valuing hypergrowth companies like Nvidia is particularly tricky, especially since the big question on investors\u2019 minds, or at least mine is, is Nvidia\u2019s earnings growth sustainable? Or are they riding a one-time boom that will inevitably result in a bust? I don\u2019t know the answer to that question, which is why I\u2019m not an Nvidia shareholder. But the point of this is, if you look beyond the traditional valuation metrics, Nvidia might not be as insanely priced as you think it is. Benz: Speaking of Nvidia, it\u2019s kind of the mother of all growth stocks, and growth stocks have outperformed value for an extended period, leaving some to question whether value-style investing is somehow fundamentally broken. What\u2019s your take on that question, on the fact that we\u2019ve had this narrow subset of winners and everything else has not been performing nearly so well? Feroldi: I\u2019ve been investing for 20 years, and during that time, I have seen investing styles and investing ideas go in and out of fashion. And if you look back at the data, even on a more historical basis, this seems to happen even at the macro level. So, during periods where US stocks have underperformed, international stocks have oftentimes shone through. And there have also been periods where growth stocks have outperformed, and value has been left behind. And the inverse has also been true. If you just think about broadly what\u2019s happened in the United States over the last 14 years, the place to be, the number-one place to invest pretty much in the world has been large-cap US stocks. Those stocks have rewarded investors hugely, both from a valuation perspective and more importantly from an earnings perspective. The earnings and the profits of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d have just grown tremendously over the last 10 years and their stock prices have grown alongside them. And small-cap companies and value companies have largely been left behind. My hunch is that there will come a point when that does reverse itself, when big-cap companies or mega-cap companies start to trade at a discount to the market as investor sentiment leaves them, and that value stocks might have their time in the sun again. But trying to figure out when that switch occurs, boy is that tricky. And it\u2019s been brutal if you\u2019ve been a value investor over the last 10-plus years because you have likely dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 over that time. This is why there\u2019s that great saying the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Can you imagine being a small-cap value money manager over the last 15 years and trying to tell your investors, \u201cYes, invest with us. Yes, we\u2019ve underperformed for 15 years, but that turnaround is on the horizon.\u201d This is why investing by style can just be so brutally hard."

        "body": "Cybersecurity companies are back in the spotlight. While the news hasn\u2019t necessarily been good, there are opportunities for long-term investors. The massive breach of AT&T\u2019s T customer data has underscored the growing prevalence of online data theft and the urgent need to protect sensitive information and systems. Here are three top cybersecurity picks for long-term investors: One of the biggest cybersecurity companies also found itself at the center of unwanted attention. A faulty software update from cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike triggered a massive technology outage, locking millions of users out of their Windows devices and causing economic disruption. That news sent CrowdStrike\u2019s stock down by a double-digit percentage, but it also drew attention to how ubiquitous the technology is, and Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan thinks the selloff creates a buying opportunity. The increasing threat of cybercrime has prompted governments and corporations to invest billions in bulking up their digital security. The secular trend has created a significant revenue opportunity for companies specializing in internet-enabled protection services and products. Fortinet, a cybersecurity vendor with a platform-based approach, offers products in network security, cloud security, zero-trust access, and security operations to more than 700,000 customers worldwide. Sales of its subscriptions and support-based business account for the bulk of its revenue. Fortinet stands to materially benefit as secular tailwinds in security and vendor consolidation increase its appeal to its clients. \u201cThe firm\u2019s established customer switching costs, buttressed by its increasingly potent network effect, will allow Fortinet to continuously gain and expand the number of clients,\u201d writes Khan. The company\u2019s wide economic moat is built on strong customer switching costs and the network effect inherent in its offerings. \u201cFortinet\u2019s platform approach to cybersecurity, by combining key aspects of a business\u2019 security needs under one umbrella, has also enabled the firm to grow its wallet share among existing clients while adding new ones,\u201d says Khan, who pegs the stock\u2019s fair value at US$77, and forecasts revenue to grow at a 14% annual rate over the next five years. He adds that the wide-moat company is poised to generate excess returns on invested capital over the next two decades. Khan contends that leading cybersecurity firms like Fortinet are well-positioned to benefit as digital threats intensify, with the economic consequences of a data breach growing, including punitive fines for customer data theft. A cloud-based cybersecurity company, CrowdStrike specializes in advanced security areas, protecting devices, cloud systems, user identities, and security operations. The Falcon platform is the crown jewel of the company\u2019s product offerings, designed to stop breaches using a unified set of cloud-based technologies that prevent all types of attacks, including malware. \u201cWe view CrowdStrike as a leader in endpoint security, a prominent part of the cybersecurity stack that protects an enterprise\u2019s endpoints from nefarious activity,\u201d Khan writes. However, CrowdStrike shares are down over 20% since the global technology meltdown sparked by a faulty software update from the company. Khan thinks that shouldn\u2019t deter investors. \u201cWe continue to view CrowdStrike as a high-quality security vendor with an exceptional track record of profitable growth that we see continuing,\u201d Khan says. \u201cWhile we viewed CrowdStrike\u2019s shares as overvalued before the chaos, we are not as pessimistic as the market about the outage\u2019s impact on the firm\u2019s business.\u201d With the decline, Khan sees CrowdStrike stock as \u201cmarginally undervalued.\u201d He explains: \u201cCrowdStrike\u2019s robust platform, strong relationships with end customers and value-added resellers, and its expansive platform that stands to benefit from vendor consolidation within security, all underscore our confidence in the firm\u2019s long-term potential.\u201d While the massive outage caused by CrowdStrike\u2019s software update gone wrong \u201ccreates near-term headwinds, our base case doesn\u2019t include a doomsday scenario with substantial customer churn and materially lower medium-to-long-term top-line expansion.\u201d Zscaler provides cloud-native cybersecurity solutions to primarily enterprise customers. The company\u2019s software-as-a-service solutions can be generally divided into two categories: Zscaler Internet Access, which ensures secure access to external applications, and Zscaler Private Access, which secures access to internal applications. The company\u2019s strategic foresight ensures its products and solutions are ideally placed to ride the wave of long-term industry trends. The firm is \u201ca pioneer and leader in zero-trust security solutions, an area of cybersecurity primed for growth due to secular trends such as increased digitization of an enterprise and a convergence of networking and security,\u201d Khan writes. The firm\u2019s strong net and gross retention metrics are evidence of its sticky product portfolio that consistently delivers value and maintains user loyalty as customers are hesitant to leave Zscaler for fear of losing their threat detection and response capabilities. \u201cWhile ZIA and ZPA are two key solutions, both of them consist of many individual modules that allow Zscaler to expand revenue from an existing client by either selling it more seats or increasing the usage of its solutions,\u201d asserts Khan, who appraises the stock to be worth US$213 per share and projects its revenue to grow at a 28% clip annually over the next five years. Notably, Zscaler\u2019s security solutions process over 250 billion requests daily. This extensive data set lets the company identify threats and new threat signatures, which are then utilized to enhance the security measures for all its clients."

        "body": "Should investors buy international stocks? For many, it\u2019s a complicated question. After all, investors often feel more \u201cin-the-know\u201d about companies domiciled in their home markets. On top of that, US companies generate a sizable chunk of their revenue outside of the US, providing US stock investors access to global growth. And international stocks have badly underperformed US stocks over time: The Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Index has significantly lagged the Morningstar US Market Index during the trailing three-, five-, and 10-year periods by a sizable margin. For many, investing in international stocks is less of a must-do and more of a why not. \u201cIt\u2019s really about casting the net as wide as possible, opening yourself up to the full spectrum of opportunities,\u201d notes Dan Lefkovitz, strategist with Morningstar Indexes. \u201cMany leading global franchises, including companies dominant in the US market, are found across the globe. Great businesses at compelling prices can come from anywhere.\u201d To develop a shortlist of international stocks to watch, we\u2019ve turned to some of the best stock-pickers among current active international fund managers by screening on the following: Eight separate fund portfolios passed our screen. These are the most popular stock picks among our list of the best international fund managers as of their most recent portfolios whose shares trade on a US exchange and that are covered by a Morningstar analyst. Data is as of July 19, 2024. This list is a good reminder that not every stock pick is a stock to buy: Most of the top stock picks on this list look fairly valued or overvalued today. As such, they make excellent watchlist candidates to buy on weakness. Here\u2019s a little bit about each of these stocks to watch, along with some commentary from the Morningstar analyst who follows the company. All data is as of July 19, 2024. Novo Nordisk is the top stock to watch from our best managers in terms of overall weighting\u2014and it\u2019s also the most overpriced stock on the list, trading 53% above our $86.00 fair value estimate. The leading provider of diabetes-care products in the world, Novo Nordisk has carved out a wide economic moat, according to Morningstar. We expect the Danish drugmaker to continue to dominate in diabetes and obesity therapy innovation. Here\u2019s Morningstar strategist Karen Andersen\u2019s commentary after Novo Nordisk\u2019s most recent earnings release: Novo Nordisk reported constant currency sales growth of 24% in the first quarter, in line with the 25% constant currency sales growth assumption we had built into our model for 2024. First-quarter growth was heavily driven by GLP-1 sales growth in diabetes (32%, mostly from Ozempic) and obesity (42%, mostly from Wegovy). Management increased constant currency sales growth guidance for 2024 by 1 percentage point (from a range of 18%-26% to a range of 19%-27%), and we\u2019ve increased our sales growth assumption to 26%. We think operating income growth could be slightly higher at 29%, also at the high end of management\u2019s updated guidance. This increased our fair value estimate from DKK 570/$84 to DKK 600/$86, but share prices are still 45% higher than our increased valuation. While we continue to see Novo Nordisk as a wide-moat firm, with strong intangible assets surrounding its cardiometabolic business, we think the high obesity drug demand and scarcity of supply have driven share prices above their intrinsic value. We assume that Novo Nordisk is capable of growing GLP-1 sales across indications from roughly $24 billion in 2023 to nearly $75 billion by 2031, prior to the patent expiration for semaglutide, the molecule in Ozempic and Wegovy. We think current share prices do not properly account for expected price declines and competition, let alone the risk of patients discontinuing therapy due to tolerability, cost, or long-term safety issues. Novo\u2019s first priority is increasing supply of its GLP-1 therapies, and we think progress with increasing supply of lower, starter doses in the US indicates they could be prepared to continue serving these patients at higher doses later in the year. In addition, Novo expects to complete the acquisition of three Catalent fill-finish sites by the end of 2024, which could help supplement capacity by 2026 as current contracts with other firms roll off. Novartis is the most widely held name among our list of best international stock-pickers: Six of our eight managers own the Swiss pharmaceutical giant. Patents, economies of scale, and a powerful distribution network support Novartis\u2019 wide economic moat. Novartis differentiates itself by its sheer number of blockbusters, including Entresto for heart failure and Cosentyx for immunology diseases, notes Morningstar director Damien Conover. The stock currently trades in line with our fair value estimate of $105.00. Morningstar\u2019s Conover had this to say about Novartis\u2019 latest earnings report: We are holding steady to our $105/CHF 96 fair value estimate (ADR/local share class) following solid second-quarter results that, although slightly ahead of our projections, were not enough to move the valuation. We believe the market is appropriately valuing the stock, with a balanced view of the strength of the pipeline offsetting patent losses, setting up moderate growth over the next three years while also supporting a wide moat over the long term. In the quarter, the firm's 11% operational sales growth was strong. However, the firm's largest drug Entresto (close to 15% of total sales) was a key driver (up 28%), and we expect the drug will face generic pressures starting in 2025. Additional generic pressure will also likely mount over the next two years, targeting several older drugs, including Sandostatin, Tasigna, and Promacta, that collectively represent close to 10% of total sales. Offsetting the patent pressures, several other drugs continue to post rapid gains. In particular, multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta (up 65%) holds the potential to exceed management's peak annual sales guidance of $4 billion based on leading efficacy and convenient dosing. Also, the firm's second-largest drug Cosentyx (which treats immunology diseases) grew 22%, led by new indications, but we expect slowing growth given competing drugs showing stronger efficacy. We remain below management's peak annual sales for Cosentyx of $7 billion. We are also 100 basis points below management's five-year compound sales growth from 2023-28. We expect modest upside to our fair value estimate if the firm can achieve its guidance. Strong advancements in the pipeline hold the most potential for accelerating growth. We are most bullish on rare disease drug Fabhalta (approved in late 2023). Also, cardiovascular disease drug pelacarsen holds very high potential, but we need to see the pivotal clinical data (likely in 2025) before adding more substantial sales into our valuation model. The third and final drugmaker on the list of top stocks to watch from the best international managers, AstraZeneca stock looks about fairly valued. We think its pipeline is among the strongest in the drug group, says Morningstar\u2019s Conover. The stock of this wide-moat UK pharmaceutical company is worth $78.00 according to Morningstar. Conover had this to say after AstraZeneca\u2019s latest earnings report: AstraZeneca reported strong first-quarter results that fell largely in line with our expectations, so we are holding firm to our fair value estimate. In the quarter, total sales increased almost 20% operationally, but we expect a deceleration in growth over the next few years as patent losses increase. Cardiometabolic drug Farxiga (up 45%) was key to growth in the quarter as the drug now represents almost 15% of total sales. New indications are helping to provide a lift for the mature drug, but we expect generic launches to intensify in 2025, which will create a drag on future growth. Also, we expect biosimilar pressure on rare-disease drug Soliris to ramp in 2025, creating additional headwinds. Offsetting the generic and biosimilar pressures, we expect continued growth from the cancer drug division (up 26%). New indications for Imfinzi, Enhertu, and Truqap should provide strong tailwinds for the division\u2019s growth over the next three years. However, we do expect some pressure on lung cancer drug Tagrisso by J&J\u2019s next-generation combination drugs Rybrevant/lazertinib, which could show a survival benefit versus Tagrisso later this year. Additionally, the conversion from Soliris to the next-generation drug Ultomiris is progressing well, with Ultomiris now generating 16% more sales than Soliris. On the pipeline, AstraZeneca continues to showcase its leading research and development strength, reinforcing its wide moat. We are increasingly optimistic about rare-disease drug Wainua (approved in late 2023), which should have data on the larger opportunity of cardiomyopathy in 2025. Also, breast cancer drug Truqap (approved in late 2023) is off to a solid start, generating $50 million in the quarter and key phase 3 data in triple-negative breast cancer and prostate cancer should be reported later this year, expanding the market potential for the drug. The core of Swiss financial services giant UBS is its global wealth management business focusing on high and ultra-high-net work individuals. But these days, the integration of Credit Suisse\u2019s business is the firm\u2019s main focus. The stock of this narrow-moat company currently trades nearly in line with our $31.50 fair value estimate. Morningstar senior analyst Johann Scholtz expressed this take on UBS\u2019 most recent results: Narrow-moat UBS reported much better-than-expected results for the first quarter of 2024, yet we felt its management team struck a somewhat cautious tone during the earnings call. Potentially higher regulatory capital requirements will continue to weigh on the share price as UBS could not provide an update on the Swiss regulator\u2019s position. Net new money inflows in wealth management continue, which suggests limited client attrition. We think investors should be careful about extrapolating the robust first-quarter results to the full year. It is unlikely that the noncore unit will repeat the $1 billion net gain it booked on the legacy Credit Suisse positions it sold during the quarter. Also, the wealth management business benefited from a particularly strong quarter for transactional fees. UBS reported a return on common equity tier 1 capital of 9.6% for the quarter. Yet, management still believes that its previous guidance of a mid-single-digit return on CET1 is the likely outcome for fiscal 2024. UBS did not shine any new light on potentially higher minimum capital requirements from the regulator. UBS has significant excess capital above its current regulatory minimum requirement, but higher capital requirements could limit its ability to return capital to shareholders. We are surprised that there has not been more interaction between the regulator and UBS before the regulator went public with its expectation that UBS will have to carry more capital in the future. One of the major initial concerns around the integration process was that it would lead to material client and revenue attrition. Despite losing around 40% of the Credit Suisse wealth management relationship managers, UBS continues to book net new money inflows. We believe that net new money inflows will ratchet up once the integration is complete. Rolls-Royce Holdings looks about 19% overvalued to us today relative to our $4.81 fair value estimate. This UK company operates three core business segments: civil aerospace, power systems, and defense. We assign a narrow moat to Rolls-Royce thanks to the technical know-how and engineering expertise in the civil aerospace and defense segment, and high switching costs in the civil aerospace segment, explains Morningstar analyst Loredana Muharremi. Here\u2019s what Muharremi said about the company\u2019s most-recent earnings release: Narrow-moat Rolls-Royce delivered another strong set of earnings for 2023, with a record-high group profit margin driven by civil aerospace performance. Although engine flying hours are still at 88% of 2019 levels, civil aerospace operating margin increased at 11.6% versus 2.5% in 2022 on the back of higher percentage of spare-part sales, increased time on wing benefiting long-term service-agreement contracts, price optimization, and cost efficiencies. Defense sales increased by 11.4% organically versus 2022 driven by defense budgets expansion in most Western regions. Operating margin increased from 11.8% in 2022 to 13.8%, driven by pricing actions, cost efficiencies, and a higher percentage of customer-funded R&D. In the power generation business, revenue growth was up 18%, driven by strong sales of power solutions in both marine and mining, with margins increasing by 200 basis points compared with 2022 due to commercial optimization action and cost efficiencies. Rolls-Royce more than doubled its free cash flow to GBP 1.3 billion from GBP 500 million in 2022, primarily driven by improvement in operating profit, despite supply chain challenges and engine flying hours still lower than 2019 levels. Results confirmed that some of the structural improvements, mostly related to price contracts renegotiation and increased time on wing, were delivered ahead of schedule, boosting our confidence in further performance improvements as the company continues working on increasing the time on wing of its engines, and in extending the life span of spare parts. Rolls-Royce aims to increase the service life of its engines by 40% in the medium term, pushing the overhaul period from three years to over five years. This is being achieved by improving engine part durability, extending component life spans, and optimizing aircraft operation and maintenance. Many national equity markets are not very national. Here's why that matters. The first and only technology stock on our list of stocks to watch from the best managers, SAP is 37% overvalued relative to our fair value estimate of $144.00. Based in Germany, the narrow-moat company provides database technology and enterprise resource planning software to 440,000 customers in more than 180 countries, approximately 80% of which are small to medium-size enterprises. Here\u2019s what Morningstar senior analyst Dan Romanoff had to say after digesting SAP\u2019s latest earnings: We maintain our fair value estimate for narrow-moat SAP after the firm reported a robust first quarter that topped our revenue and margin expectations. Management reaffirmed 2024 guidance and reiterated its 2025 ambition, which we believe are supported by continued strategic pivots toward the cloud and business artificial intelligence, or AI, segments. Overall, we see results as solid and a continuation of recent trends. Although we continue to expect some churn due to forced cloud migration, we maintain our belief in SAP\u2019s strong suite of offerings and the inherent switching costs associated with core software systems. Shares already incorporate the full benefits of the cloud transition and are overvalued, in our opinion. Total revenue grew 8% year over year to EUR 8.0 billion, with cloud revenue contributing EUR 3.9 billion and recording a 24% growth year over year. Furthermore, the firm reported an impressive cloud backlog of EUR 14.2 billion, up by 27% over the year-ago period. Backlog outpacing cloud growth is heartening. We were encouraged to see the continued growth of \u201cRISE with SAP\u201d and \u201cGROW with SAP,\u201d which facilitate cloud migration and onboarding needs of existing customers and net-new customers, respectively. We are also pleased with the company\u2019s strategic focus on business AI offerings like Joule, which automates common business transactions and human resources processes, and we anticipate it to continue building backlog and to support evolving customer expectations. On profitability, non-IFRS operating margin was down 610 basis points year over year to 19.1%, yielding non-IFRS earnings per share of EUR 0.80. Margins were negatively affected by EUR 2.2 billion of restructuring expenses associated with the ongoing transformation program, partially offset by strength in cloud revenue. The first international stock pick from the best managers that\u2019s classified as a value stock, TotalEnergies looks only slightly undervalued relative to our $75.00 fair value estimate. This French integrated oil and gas company aims to grow energy production on all fronts while pursuing its ambition of net zero emissions by 2050 and delivering near-term cash flow growth even at relatively low oil prices. Morningstar director Allen Good had this take on the firm\u2019s most recent earnings: No-moat TotalEnergies\u2019 first-quarter adjusted net income fell to $5.1 billion from $6.5 billion in first-quarter 2023, largely due to lower gas prices and weaker refining margins. The decline in gas prices\u2014the major European benchmark NBP is down 46% from a year ago\u2014particularly weighed on integrated LNG results. Refining and chemical adjusted net income fell 41% year-over-year, largely due to weaker refining margins, which declined 21% from the prior year. Integrated power was a bright spot in the results as earnings increased 65% from a year ago as net capacity doubled. Oil and gas production decreased 2% from the year before to 2,461 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding the impact of divested Canadian assets, production increased by 1.5% from the year before. During the quarter, Total paid a dividend of EUR 0.79 a share, an increase of 7% from a year ago. As with the first quarter, Total will repurchase $2 billion in stock during the second quarter. That run rate implies a decline from 2023's $9 billion repurchase level, but $1.5 billion was tied to asset sales, implying an increase for 2024. Total maintains one of the highest targeted payout ratios of more than 40%. Our fair value estimate of $75 is unchanged, as little has changed since Total announced its 2024 objectives a few months ago. Although shares remain fully valued, in our view, we continue to view Total as one of the more attractive options among integrated oils, given its prudent energy transition strategy and strong management team. BNP Paribas is the most undervalued stock pick from our best international fund managers: The stock of France\u2019s largest publicly traded bank looks 25% undervalued relative to our $46.00 fair value estimate. BNP Paribas has reported consistent earnings during the past decade, which is noteworthy when compared with its peers. We also think the bank is likely to benefit from market share gains in investment banking. After examining recent results, Morningstar senior analyst Johann Scholtz noted: BNP Paribas recorded a strong rebound in its first-quarter 2024 earnings, comfortably beating the company-compiled consensus estimates of revenue, operating expenses, and credit costs. Along with Lloyds Bank, BNP is one of our preferred names for investors who want to invest in European banks. We believe BNP\u2019s discount rating relative to the average valuation of the European banking sector is unjustified. We expect BNP\u2019s midcycle profitability to lag the European banking sector average slightly, but BNP has one of the most stable earnings track records of the European banks that we cover. Given its lower interest-rate sensitivity, we view BNP as a defensive option in the face of potentially lower interest rates. BNP reiterated its guidance that it expects net profit above EUR 11.2 billion for fiscal 2024. Our expectation is around 5% below this, which aligns with consensus. BNP also indicated that it believes the second half of the year will be stronger than the first. This, combined with the solid first-quarter results, points to earnings comfortably ahead of guidance and market expectations. We will update our model shortly and could increase our EUR 85 per share fair value estimate. Credit quality remained sound, with the two problem areas of Italy and personal finance reporting lower loan-loss provisions for the quarter. BNP is guiding a slight decline in its loan-loss provisions over the next two years, and it disclosed that its direct commercial real estate exposure is below 4%, with virtually no US commercial real estate exposure. BNP reported a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.1%, which, compared with its target of a 12% CET1 ratio, suggests that BNP has less excess capital than many of its European peers. However, we believe that BNP should generate sufficient organic capital to comfortably support annual buybacks of around 2% of its current market value. BNP already offers a healthy 6% forward dividend yield. Though the market is having a strong 2024, top investors are still finding undervalued stocks to invest in. These stock picks are popular with top-rated concentrated small- and mid-cap growth fund managers. As the stock market rallies, top investors are taking profits in these names. The second stock to watch on our list from the industrials sector, RELX stock looks about fairly valued. RELX, based in the UK, is a global provider of business information, analytics, and decision-making tools for professionals in various industries. It generates revenue mainly by creating and selling access to curated information databases, analytics, and journals. We think shares are worth $46.75. Here\u2019s Morningstar senior analyst Rob Hales\u2019 commentary about the company\u2019s recent results: Wide-moat RELX\u2019s first-quarter trading update indicated initial performance in fiscal 2024 is tracking in line with guidance and our expectations. Shares are trading flat intraday. We don\u2019t expect to make a material change to our fair value estimate. Revenue growth was described as strong across three of the four segments while revenue growth in the scientific, technical, and medical segment was described as good. Overall, growth continues to be primarily driven by the ongoing shift in business mix toward higher-growth analytics and decision tools. Guidance for fiscal 2024 was unchanged. Overall, revenue growth, EBIT growth, and constant-currency EPS growth are expected to be strong. In the risk segment, revenue growth is expected to be strong with EBIT growth slightly exceeding revenue growth. In the STM segment, revenue growth is expected to be good with EBIT growth slightly exceeding revenue growth. In the legal segment, revenue growth is expected to be strong with EBIT growth exceeding revenue growth. In the exhibitions segment, revenue growth is expected to be strong with a further improvement in the EBIT margin. The final stock on our list of stocks to watch from the best international stock fund managers, UK-based Compass Group is the largest foodservice company globally. Foodservice remains a large fragmented global industry that offers Compass ample room to grow, according to Morningstar. The stock is trading near our fair value estimate of $27.80. Morningstar Europe market strategist Michael Field had this to say about the company\u2019s most-recent earnings: Narrow-moat Compass Group delivered a solid first-half update. Organic revenue growth was up 11.2%, a strong performance. Clearly, growth is falling from the elevated levels of 2022 and 2023 but remains high as tailwinds persist. We view the negative share price reaction to these strong results as evidence of the high expectations built into Compass Group\u2019s current share price. Compass Group shares screen as fairly valued relative to our fair value estimate. Management modestly raised its full-year guidance to target 10% organic growth, from high single digits, and underlying operating profit growth toward 15%, from 13% previously. Operating margins remain below pandemic levels, but progress this year is encouraging, and we believe this will rectify itself over the next year or two. As contracts naturally mature and bring higher levels of efficiency, this brings cost savings and other potential opportunities for margin improvement. Longer term, as Compass Group is the number-one catering company in the world, we believe it is well positioned to continue to take market share, as many smaller operators folded over the course of the pandemic. How long these tailwinds persist is another question, but the promise of 10% growth for another six months is encouraging. Eight funds passed our screen and therefore qualify as our best managers. The foreign large-blend category is home to Artisan International Value, JPMorgan International Equity, and MFS International Equity. Causeway International Value, Dodge & Cox International Stock and Oakmark International land in the foreign large-value category. Lastly, Goldman Sachs GQG Partners International Opportunities and WCM Focused International Growth represent the foreign large-growth category. These high-conviction funds investing in large-cap international stocks all earn Morningstar\u2019s top rating in 2024. Morningstar thinks that companies with economic moats possess significant advantages that allow them to successfully fend off competitors for a decade or more. Companies can carve out their economic moats in a variety of different ways\u2014by having high switching costs, through strong brand identities, or by possessing economies of scale, to name just a few. Companies that we think can maintain their competitive advantages for at least 10 years earn narrow economic moat ratings; those we think can successfully compete for 20 years or longer earn wide economic moat ratings. Morningstar editors Margaret Giles and Lauren Solberg developed the methodologies and tools required to create this content."

        "body": "The Biden administration recently proposed removing nearly all medical debt from consumer credit rating calculations. This move could be particularly important for people who struggle to make credit-based purchases while managing medical debts. However, it may be less meaningful for the growing numbers of people who defray their healthcare payments with specialized medical credit cards or medical loans. Between 2018 and 2020, consumers used such methods to pay for nearly $23 billion in healthcare expenses, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Medical loans and medical credit cards are financing options specifically designed for healthcare bills. As with any loan or credit card, they can help a person break a large expense into more manageable payments. But as with any debt, there are some things to know if you\u2019re considering them to pay for your medical needs. Medical credit cards and medical loans have increased in popularity as servicers have expanded their menu of covered expenses. They can now be applied to everything from copays to elective surgery, cosmetic procedures, and emergency visits. These financing options have taken their place alongside the more familiar ways to pay your medical bills: insurance, flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts, installment plans, and plain old cash. Who offers medical credit cards? Numerous financial companies now market medical credit cards, including Synchrony Financial, Wells Fargo, and Comenity Capital Bank. What is covered? With its use restrictions and payment structure, a medical credit card works similarly to a store credit card. It is typically limited to use only at healthcare providers, for medical services. How much coverage is available? Balance limits vary by card issuer, and they are based on the applicant\u2019s credit rating. What interest rates are offered? The typical medical credit card\u2019s APR is 26.99%, versus 20% for the average general credit card, according to the CFPB. What to consider: Use caution and avoid using a high-rate card to pay for medical care, says Christine Benz, Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance and retirement planning. \u201cThese types of financing may look like a convenient way to cover medical bills, but with interest rates that are generally worse than credit cards\u2019, it\u2019s hard to see a case for them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only reasonable use case would be if special terms are on offer and you know that you can use them to your advantage, paying off the debt before the high interest kicks in.\u201d The only reasonable use case would be if special terms are on offer and you know that you can use them to your advantage, paying off the debt before the high interest kicks in. Who offers medical loans? Many financial institutions, banks, and credit unions offer such loans. What is covered? Medical loans can cover electives, planned care, or emergencies, depending on the loan\u2019s terms. In some cases, you may be able to use them to pay high deductibles and out-of-network healthcare charges. Medical loans are frequently taken out ahead of a procedure and designated for a specific medical treatment. According to the CFPB, unlike medical credit cards, loans \u201care generally offered before a treatment and only authorized to cover that treatment (for example, to cover the cost of a root canal procedure).\u201d How much coverage is available? Medical loan amounts can range from $1,000 to $200,000. What interest rates are offered? Interest rates for medical loans can range widely, from 6.99% to 35.99%. Medical loans are frequently designed as installment or term loans, with payment schedules that may run anywhere from six to 24 months or even longer. What to consider: As with any loan, it\u2019s important to have a full understanding of the lender\u2019s terms and conditions before signing up, says Sheryl Rowling, Morningstar\u2019s editorial director for financial advice. \u201cGetting a loan like that is like getting any other type of high-cost consumer debt: Overcoming the interest is going to be the biggest hurdle,\u201d Rowling says. \u201cAnd if there are other ways around it, those ways should be explored.\u201d Medical credit cards and loans are sometimes promoted with a deferred interest rate\u2014for example, 0% interest for a certain term, such as six or 12 months. This seemingly interest-free financing can be appealing, particularly in the midst of a medical situation. What might be less clear is that \u201cdeferred\u201d means the interest is held back\u2014but it continues to build. Often, the special interest rate only applies if the bill is fully paid before the end of the payment term. If a payment is missed or the debt isn\u2019t completely cleared by the date in the agreement, that built-up interest is then added to the amount owed. A missed deadline can be expensive. Benz says: \u201cThe only way to use them well is to do so from a position of financial strength. For example, if there are special terms on offer, such as 0% free financing for the first year, make sure that you\u2019ll have the funds to pay back the loan or credit card when that free financing period expires.\u201d The only way to use [these products] well is to do so from a position of financial strength Medical loans and credit cards are frequently marketed to patients through medical providers but serviced through financial companies. This distinction affects how the debt is categorized, a difference that users will want to keep in mind. Because medical credit cards and medical loans are serviced by a lender\u2014not a medical provider\u2014they are not classified as \u201cmedical debt.\u201d Thus, changes made to debt collection practices in 2022, which removed some medical debt from credit rating calculations, do not apply. A default can be sent to collections and (as of now) can affect the borrower\u2019s credit rating. Rowling and Benz recommend that people explore other possibilities before taking on a medical loan or medical credit card. If insurance is not an option, Rowling says patients could talk to their healthcare providers about creating a payment plan. \u201cMany times, you can have the medical facility itself finance what it is you\u2019re doing and work out a payment arrangement with them,\u201d she says. Rowling notes that such payment plans often provide easier terms and little or no interest. \u201cMany times you can make payments over time, as opposed to having to pay in a lump sum. It\u2019s also possible to negotiate the amount owed now,\u201d Rowling says. \u201cFrequently, medical facilities will accept a lower amount if you\u2019re able to pay it all at once.\u201d Benz suggests considering a wait-and-save approach if the situation allows. \u201cIn the case of an elective procedure that can wait and is HSA- or FSA-eligible, another idea is to save in those accounts in advance of the planned procedure,\u201d she says."

        "body": "Jane is a 67-year-old tech executive who has been diligently saving for retirement since she entered the workforce after college. She has more than enough saved in her diversified retirement accounts to last the rest of her lifetime, regardless of any emergencies that may arise along the way. She\u2019s also already assessed and taken care of her insurance needs and considered her tax management needs, given the types of accounts she owns. Given this information, do you think Jane is ready to retire? Before reading on, choose one of the three options below: A) Absolutely. B) Nope, not yet. C) Maybe. There isn\u2019t enough information. The answer is \u2026 (drum roll please) \u2026 C! Although this short description suggests that Jane is financially ready to retire, it doesn\u2019t say anything about her emotional readiness. And that can be just as important. When people think of retirement readiness, their minds usually go to their finances. Given the importance of being able to fund retirement, considering your finances first is completely reasonable. However, that isn\u2019t all it takes to prepare for retirement. Too many people discount the psychological impact of retiring, which may have harmful consequences if you\u2019re not prepared. Why does this happen? Though the prospect of never working again may seem exciting, retirement creates its own type of stress. When a person retires, their whole life is turned upside down. Their everyday routine goes out the window. The connections they used to make daily become nonexistent. Even their sense of individuality and independence may start to seem shaky. So, what is a person to do\u2014just never retire? Absolutely not. But we should emotionally prepare for retirement just as much as we financially prepare. Luckily, getting emotionally prepared won\u2019t take 40 years (the way saving for retirement did), but it will still take some time and a bit of soul-searching. Emotionally preparing for retirement often means integrating some of the good elements of preretirement work into your postretirement life. These structures can make it easier for you to take full advantage of the \u201cfree\u201d time that retirement brings. 1) Establish a routine (bonus points if you incorporate healthy habits). One of the reasons retirement is such a shock is because of the loss of your daily routine. Research has shown a relationship between routines and health, including mental health. Implementing a planned structure to your day can help you feel in control of your time, which is one thing retirement gives you a lot of. Before retiring, try mapping out what a week of your life could look like. You don\u2019t have to plan every hour, but establish a general schedule and try to identify a few tasks each day. What time will you wake up every morning? What days will you go to your spinning class? Will you reserve one hour each morning for reading? What days will you concentrate on that woodworking project? 2) Plan for social connections. When retirees are asked what they miss most about work, 41% say they miss the people and the social stimulation. This number shouldn\u2019t be a surprise: Research has shown how strong social connections can lead to a longer life, better health, and a sense of well-being. However, most people retire without any consideration for their social connections. Before retiring, have a plan to see loved ones. Maybe it\u2019s taking care of the grandkids every Monday, meeting a friend at a coffee shop every Sunday morning, or taking an aerobics class with a friend every week. It may seem foreign to have to plan social connections with folks you used to see every day without effort, but once you take away those common meeting areas\u2014whether it\u2019s the water station or the coffee shop before catching your train\u2014you must put in a little extra effort to keep those connections strong. 3) Define your life purpose and make sure it is represented in your retirement life. This last item on the checklist is centered on your idea of a \u201cgood life.\u201d This may not be easy to define, but existing tools and frameworks can help guide the process. In our recent research, we found success in helping people uncover their life values in the context of their financial goals by using the PERMA-V framework. This framework is from the field of positive psychology and posits that well-being has several components: positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, accomplishment, and vitality. Before retiring, take a sheet of paper and try writing down your definition of a life well lived. First, try writing down what comes to mind. Then, refer to the PERMA-V framework: Review each component and jot down additions to your definition. At this point, you can also consider the parts of your current job that you enjoy. Not everyone considers their 9-to-5 job their passion, but you may find that you do get some source of meaning and fulfillment from it. Make sure to take note of those positive aspects. Now, rewrite your definition of a good life, taking all the notes you created into consideration. With this definition in mind, go back and add to your routine and social connections plan. For example, if the life value of accomplishment resonates with you, maybe you could consider getting a degree during retirement or trying out a small business\u2014something that will give you that sense of accomplishment. It\u2019s important to note that this checklist is really just a shortlist. Preretirees should consider this a starting point to psychologically preparing for retirement and should add to it as needed. For example, consider the parts of your current job (or preretirement life in general) that you love, hate, and feel neutral about. What else can you do to make sure you take the good with you and leave the bad behind? When people think of retirement, they tend to focus on the bad or stress-inducing part of increased life expectancies, such as the associated medical costs. (I once heard someone lament that her family members had very long life spans.) Although these concerns are warranted and worth preparing for financially, we should still strive to see the good that a longer life can give us. Laura Carstensen, the founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, encapsulates this idea with five words: \u201cWe have 30 extra years.\u201d These 30 years are our bonus. Our extra reward. What will you do with it?"

        "body": "Learning about financial topics can feel: A. Intimidating B. Complicated C. Challenging D. All of the above. If you\u2019ve selected any of the answers above, you\u2019re not alone. Taking the first step toward financial literacy is the hardest. And unfortunately, the internet may not exactly be our friend here. Simply searching an investment term can land you in an alphabet soup of complex financial terms or worse, leave you doomscrolling headlines like \u201cGen Z is outpacing boomers on income, millennials on home ownership.\u201d There\u2019s another, less intimidating way to break into the realm of financial topics: Pick up a book. And not just any book, but one of the best investing books for beginners. Whether you\u2019re starting from scratch or looking for a niche read on an investment topic, there\u2019s something for every investor in our book list. Time and time again, these are the go-to recommendations from investing enthusiasts and Morningstar specialists. 1. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns, by John Bogle Investing icon John Bogle left behind an impressive legacy: He revolutionized the mutual fund industry and was a tireless advocate for investors. He pioneered the index fund, which allowed investors to gain diversified exposure to the stock market at a very low cost, helping them keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets. His book explains why low fees significantly affect returns. It also addresses topics like mean-reversion and tax costs. The text is accessible and shorter than many other investing books, and it includes quotes from many prominent financial figures who support Bogle\u2019s claims. 2. The Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Investing, by Taylor Larimore, Mel Lindauer, and Michael LeBoeuf The advice of The Vanguard Group founder John Bogle is echoed in this comprehensive guide for investors of all experience levels. Packaged into 23 short, lighthearted chapters, this book contains practical advice and explores many aspects of investing, from how to choose the financial lifestyle that fits you to how to balance your emotions to truly master your investments. This guide also provides external resources and other information for readers who want to dive deeper into any of the topics that the longtime Bogleheads cover. The Bogleheads are investing enthusiasts who honor Bogle and his advice, living by a philosophy to \u201cemphasize starting early, living below one\u2019s means, regular saving, broad diversification, simplicity, and sticking to one\u2019s investment plan regardless of market conditions.\u201d Members actively discuss financial news and theory in a forum. 3. Morningstar\u2019s 30-Minute Money Solutions: A Step-by-Step Guide to Managing Your Finances, by Christine Benz Even if you understand investing basics, you might struggle to incorporate them into your personal finances. Executing them in manageable steps can prove even more challenging. That\u2019s the beauty of this book. Christine Benz, Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance, breaks financial planning down into bite-size chunks that anyone can handle. You start with basics like assessing your net worth and creating an organization system, and you progressively conquer more advanced topics including retirement investing, college savings, and estate planning. If you want to meld investment basics with tangible advice, this book is a great option. 4. I Will Teach You to Be Rich, by Ramit Sethi Advisor and The New York Times bestselling author Ramit Sethi outlines a six-week program for 20- to 35-year-olds to learn the four pillars of personal finance: banking, saving, budgeting, and investing. Sethi shares his strategies for eliminating student loans and debt; finding a balance with saving and spending every month; and preparing to purchase a house or car. In the newest edition, he includes stories from readers and insights on the psychology of investing. Sethi strives to demonstrate to investors how to make investments that grow with them and their goals, and how they can spend their money on the things they want without feeling guilty. 5. The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing, by Benjamin Graham Benjamin Graham is known as the father of value investing. He taught Warren Buffett, a modern investing icon. His book lays a framework for evaluating a business\u2019 worth based on financial value, not short-term trading techniques. In his book, Graham defined many important investing concepts such as \u201cmargin of safety,\u201d which is an important input in the Morningstar Rating for stocks. The revised edition includes commentary from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s personal-finance columnist Jason Zweig that contextualizes and modernizes the text. With Zweig\u2019s commentary on every chapter, the book is north of 500 pages, which is a lot; however, it\u2019s a thorough introduction to investing. If getting through means skimming a few chapters, no judgment here. 6. A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, by Burton Malkiel If Graham teaches you how to evaluate a business, Burton Malkiel explains why that might not help you. The Princeton economist argues that markets demonstrate efficiency because people are analyzing a company\u2019s value. (Efficiency means a company\u2019s share price reflects its current worth, and its price will change when new information alters a business\u2019 worth.) Malkiel recommends earning the market\u2019s return instead of beating it, which he compellingly argues is good enough. The book was first published in 1973, but updated editions have added contemporary topics. These include exchange-traded funds and investment techniques like smart beta (which Morningstar prefers to call \u201cstrategic beta,\u201d but I digress). 7. The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, by Warren Buffett Many consider Warren Buffett to be the best modern investor. He has risen to fame as Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s CEO, a position he\u2019s held for over 50 years. Berkshire Hathaway invests in high-quality businesses with strong growth potential. But Buffett only buys such companies when they\u2019re selling at an attractive margin of safety (hat tip to his mentor, Benjamin Graham). This makes Buffett an extreme stock-picker. Under his reign, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s growth has far surpassed that of the S&P 500, a testament to the success of his approach. Each year, Buffett writes an annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, and all of them are published on the company\u2019s website, so anyone can read them. Buffett writes in a straightforward style that is accessible to investors of all skill levels, and he\u2019s often very funny to boot. The Essays of Warren Buffett weaves together Buffett\u2019s essays into a sequential, cohesive book. Morningstar employees and investing specialists recently shared their latest book picks. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re recommending: 1. How to Think About Money, by Jonathan Clements \u201cJonathan Clements is an honest-to-goodness legend in investment writing, someone who manages to combine extreme clarity of thought with wisdom and wit. I\u2019ve read practically every word that Jonathan has written since discovering him in the 1990s, and his work very much influenced my own career trajectory. Like all of Jonathan\u2019s books, this one recognizes that successful financial plans are invariably rooted in thrift, knowing your values, and good old-fashioned common sense.\u201d Christine Benz, Director of Personal Finance and Retirement Planning 2. Your Best Financial Life: Save Smart Now for the Future You Want, by Ann Lester \u201cI thought this was a great introduction for younger investors.\u201d Amy Arnott, Portfolio Strategist 3. Just Keep Buying, by Nick Maggiulli \u201cJust Keep Buying focuses squarely on something that should be obvious but that seems to get criminally underplayed in the financial media: the importance of growing your income as an avenue to greater savings and investing opportunities. It also emphasizes the virtue of staying disciplined about investing by using a dollar-cost averaging program. It\u2019s beautifully written.\u201d Christine Benz, Director of Personal Finance and Retirement Planning 4. Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics, by Richard H. Thaler \u201cThis is actually a core book for behavioral economics, so I\u2019m a little late to the game, but it\u2019s a good refresher of some core behavioral principles. It\u2019s also interesting to get the \u2018economics perspective\u2019 versus the \u2018psychology perspective\u201d of some of these principles. Both groups thought about these inconsistencies in human behavior differently, so it\u2019s fascinating to get an insider\u2019s view on how both lines of thought became intermingled.\u201d Samantha Lamas, Senior Behavioral Researcher Still have room on your shelf? Check out these titles. Why Moats Matter: The Morningstar Approach to Stock Investing, by Heather Brilliant and Elizabeth Collins If you\u2019re looking for a breakdown on the legendary Warren Buffett\u2019s economic moat concept, this is the book for you. With this guide, you will learn how to find great companies at equally great prices, gain a better understanding of Morningstar\u2019s approach, and more. Thinking, Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman This book looks at financial planning and decision-making from a psychological standpoint. How do our biases and faults influence our financial plans and judgment of the stock market? To find the answer, psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman explores how two systems work together. \u201cSystem 1\u2033 is fast, instinctive, and emotional, while \u201cSystem 2\u2033 is slow, deliberative, and logical. Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets, by Nassim Nicholas Taleb This is another book that addresses how our emotions and past experiences affect how we make decisions, specifically financial ones, in our lives. Nassim Nicholas Taleb also focuses on randomness. He believes that humans look for or come up with explanations when there aren\u2019t any, emphasizing that sometimes things just simply happen. Seeking these explanations then affects our financial decisions and can form certain habits. The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor, by Howard Marks Chairman and co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management Howard Marks shares his journey in investment management and uses his experiences to shine a light on what is going on in the stock market today. Marks challenges readers to resist following the crowd and instead invest with a more critical, contrarian approach. If You Can: How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly, by William Bernstein In this particularly short, 50-page read, financial theorist and neurologist William Bernstein keeps finance simple. He teaches the very basics to help get young individuals off on the right foot with their investments and retirement plans. Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties, by Beth Kobliner If your financial to-dos include paying down debt, boosting your credit score, steering clear of financial missteps, and figuring out the world of personal finance in general, then this is the book for you. Beth Kobliner\u2019s goal is to help investors in their 20s and 30s get their financial lives in order. In her words, \u201cIt\u2019s time to get a financial life.\u201d The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness, by Morgan Housel Money defines a lot in our financial lives, including what you can invest in and when you can retire. It also defines our behavior. In this collection of stories, Morgan Housel explores how money affects the way we make financial decisions from a psychological perspective. Investing Success, by Lynnette Khalfani-Cox The best thing about this former The Long View podcast guest\u2019s book? Her advice is simple, straightforward, and works in any financial environment. No matter how familiar\u2014or unfamiliar\u2014you are with investing, Lynnette Khalfani-Cox will help you take the right steps to building a solid financial life. Here are the key investing steps for all of life\u2019s stages and some portfolios to get you started. Use these resources to help you set up retirement savings, tackle debt, and begin investing.

        "body": "Election years are a ripe opportunity for behavioral mistakes. There seems to be a lot at stake given the potentially huge change coming around the corner. Uncertainty hangs in the air, taking up all the oxygen in the room. With all these stressors at play, it\u2019s no wonder our minds ramp up our use of cognitive shortcuts, some of which are bound to lead us astray. As we inch closer to the 2024 election, here are a few cognitive biases and consequences I\u2019m keeping in mind. If someone were to ask me which bias I hate the most, I would probably say confirmation bias. This is our tendency to pay more attention to and more easily accept information that supports our existing beliefs. The reason for my ire is that even if a person is diligently researching a topic to make a well-rounded decision, their brain may be fastidiously working to latch onto research that supports their existing beliefs. In other words, even the most well-meaning of investors may fall prey to this bias. When preparing for an election, we may all be doing some sort of research to understand our preferences for key issues. As we do our due diligence, we must acknowledge that confirmation bias may be at play, swaying our opinion toward our preconceived notions. Existing research even notes that as we examine evidence that does not support our opinion, we are more likely to be critical of that evidence. On the other hand, we ask fewer questions regarding evidence that supports our opinions. For example, if we see a social-media post that supports our preferred political candidate, we may be less likely to question the accuracy and sourcing of the statistics featured in the post or the credibility of the author. However, we may be much less forgiving for a post that criticizes our preferred candidate. Confirmation bias is a conniving one, but we are not completely powerless to it. Before conducting your research, try to come up with a list of questions to judge the efficacy of evidence and ask those same questions for each piece you encounter. For example, maybe you want to ensure the research study sample was large enough and representative of the United States. Also, make sure to read the same number of articles that support and oppose your existing opinion\u2014this can help make sure you at least expose yourself to diverse opinions. Past research suggest that elections do not have a meaningful medium to long-term impact on market performance. In other words, though the election itself may cause some volatility, it\u2019s only for the short term. If one were to read various media articles prophesizing doom and gloom for certain industries based on who is elected, this research finding may seem hard to believe. That\u2019s because front-page/trendy media can be misleading and capitalize on behavioral biases to garner a strong reaction, like availability bias (our tendency to overweigh information that comes more readily to mind) and negativity bias (our tendency to pay more attention to things of a negative nature). These biases prompt us to latch on to doom and gloom media and disregard the fact that these stories usually haven\u2019t played out in the past. This results in our minds believing this election will be the one to solidify our fate\u2014even though we probably felt that way about past elections, too, and things turned out OK. The best way to avoid these decision-making errors is to conduct an information audit. Write down the news and information sites you believe are unbiased (or as unbiased as possible) and that report well-balanced, factual arguments. Make sure to include sites that support and oppose your political affiliation. Now, devote your attention to these sites. Don\u2019t click on those eye-catching articles from questionable sites. Unfollow any influencers with dubious (yet somehow popular) claims. Delete any apps on your phone that may lead you to those in-demand but unhelpful posts. For example, I don\u2019t keep the Apple News app on my phone. An election year puts a deadline on our decisions. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make a change before X becomes president, we are goners!\u201d This looming deadline and all the milestones leading up to an election may prompt investors to feel that they are under immense time pressure when making decisions. Unfortunately, this time pressure may prompt a scarcity mindset: Because we feel like we don\u2019t have sufficient time, we are more likely to engage in reflexive responses, a more narrow and concrete style of thinking, and fail to think critically about the problem. To avoid this decision-making trap, prepare for these supposed dire circumstances before they happen. For example, implement a trading rule that states you will not make any changes to your portfolio unless it falls by X%. Also, don\u2019t forget about the possibility of choosing to do nothing at all. As Danny Noonan found in his research, based on historical data, investors are better off ignoring Washington, D.C., entirely. Presidential elections are important, and there is much at stake, but investors must remember that regardless of who wins, they are better off staying invested for the long term. As you consider your investing decisions amid the hubbub of the election year, keep these cognitive biases in mind."

        "body": "New retirees frequently rhapsodize about the joys of tossing their alarm clocks into the trash and filling their days with whatever activities they find gratifying. But if they\u2019re honest, most new retirees find the financial aspect of the retirement transition to be a little jarring. Switching from spending current employment income to spending from a portfolio might not feel great. And, of course, figuring out how much you can safely withdraw is more art than science, too. Estimating actual cash flow needs is a tricky business, too. While retirees are often counseled to estimate that they\u2019ll spend 75% to 80% of their working incomes in retirement, a paper by David Blanchett, formerly of Morningstar and now at PGIM, demonstrated that there can be huge variations in income-replacement rates among retirees\u2014with factors such as preretirement income and savings rates serving as key swing factors. Based on Blanchett\u2019s findings, higher-income, higher-saving households may well need just 60% (or even less) of their preretirement income during retirement, while lower-earning, lower-saving households may need closer to 90%. Ultimately, it may be difficult to forecast your actual income-replacement needs with a great deal of precision. Even as you attempt to anticipate every in-retirement expense to the penny, unforeseen expenditures such as healthcare costs can buffet spending around on a year-to-year basis. But because anticipated income needs are such a key ingredient in the retirement-income puzzle, it's helpful to come up with as realistic a figure as possible while also being realistic that your own expenditures are apt to vary over time. Here are the key steps to take as you do so. A key starting point when determining an income-replacement ratio is your working income. If you\u2019re close to retirement and seek to maintain a standard of living in retirement that\u2019s similar to what you had while you were working, using your current salary as a baseline is reasonable. But if you\u2019re younger\u2014say, in your 40s\u2014it may be wise to nudge up your baseline income for retirement-planning purposes, because your current income may not be reflective of what you\u2019ll want to spend when you eventually retire. Not only are you apt to receive cost-of-living adjustments as the years go by, but career gains could also lead to a higher salary over time, which you may want to \u201creplace\u201d in retirement. As Blanchett noted in his paper, the average college-educated individual will make a 50% higher salary at retirement than he or she did at age 25. Gains in salary over time are less pronounced for people with lower levels of educational attainment. The next step in arriving at your customized income-replacement rate is to take a look at what percentage of your salary you\u2019re saving\u2014or expect to save by the time you retire\u2014and subtract that from your baseline salary amount. One of the reasons that higher-income individuals typically have lower income-replacement rates than lower-income people is that the former are able to save a higher percentage of their salaries during their working years; they need less of their salaries to fund basic living expenses. A household saving 20% of its income will see its income-replacement rate drop to 80% right out of the box, even without factoring in any planned lifestyle changes, such as downsizing homes. If you\u2019re several years from retirement, it may be that you\u2019ll kick up your savings rate if your income grows. (See above.) Because they\u2019re no longer paying Social Security or Medicare taxes, many people realize tax savings when they retire. Those gained savings tend to be more pronounced for higher-income workers than lower-income ones. More-affluent households may see a bigger percentage drop in taxes in retirement than lower-income households because they have greater control over their taxable income now that they\u2019re no longer earning a paycheck; the less they pull from their portfolios, the less they\u2019re taxed on. Moreover, even as both types of households are drawing income from their portfolios to fund in-retirement living expenses, the higher-income household is apt to be able to have more levers available to keep taxes down\u2014for example, drawing just enough assets from traditional, Roth, and taxable accounts to stay within the lowest tax bracket. Housing costs are another line item with the potential to change substantially in retirement. Is your plan to come into retirement without a mortgage, for example? Or perhaps you intend to relocate or downsize in some fashion? Even though the main goal of downsizing may be to add the home-sale proceeds to your retirement kitty, it can have the salutary effect of reducing property taxes and lowering outlays for insurance, utilities, and maintenance. As a senior homeowner, you may also be able to qualify for a reduction in your property taxes, depending on where you live. Of course, not every household sees a drop in housing costs during retirement; some retirees stay put in their primary residences while also purchasing second homes that actually add to their total housing-related outlays. Retirement-planning guides often urge retirees to factor in changes in other expenses, such as commuting, clothes for work, and meals out while on the job or due to busy work schedules. For some households, these expense changes may be minimal, but for others, they may be more substantial. As with housing costs, lifestyle-related outlays aren't guaranteed to decline in retirement, so don't assume a reduction in yours without crunching the numbers. If a heavy travel schedule or an expensive hobby are on your retirement to-do list, you might see any cost reductions on line items like food offset by increased expenditures elsewhere. Thus far, we\u2019ve focused on ways that retirees might expect to see their expenses drop in retirement. But there\u2019s one major area where they\u2019re likely to increase, and that\u2019s in the realm of healthcare. A recent Fidelity study showed that the average lifetime out-of-pocket healthcare outlay for a 65-year-old retiring today would be nearly $160,000, and that figure doesn\u2019t even include long-term-care expenditures. Higher healthcare costs later in life are the key reason Blanchett identified what he calls \u201cThe Retirement Spending Smile.\u201d That\u2019s the tendency for household expenses to be on the high side just after retirement (when spending on travel and leisure is apt to be high), dip in midretirement, then head back up toward the end of life as healthcare costs increase for some older adults. If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s going without long-term-care insurance, in particular, recognize that your household\u2019s total healthcare-related outlay could spike dramatically toward the end of your or your partner\u2019s lives. Working through each of these line items may get you closer to your actual income-replacement rate than relying on general guidelines such as 75% or 80% for income replacement. At the same time, it\u2019s worthwhile to approach the exercise with the knowledge that there\u2019s much about your future spending that you can\u2019t foretell. Long-term-care costs are the biggest wild card for people who don\u2019t have long-term-care insurance or for those who have policies that are capped at specific benefits. Many seniors have also been called upon to help their adult children or their families, unexpectedly increasing their financial outlays in retirement. Homeowners, too, can incur costly and unexpected repair bills at random times. All of these factors can send your expenditures out of line with what you thought they would be. The potential for those unanticipated expenses argues for nudging your own income-replacement rate a bit higher to allow for some wiggle room in your planning.

        "body": "When you buy a stock, you own a piece of the underlying business. It\u2019s important to understand the quality of the business you own, for the same reason you would test drive a new car before buying it. The best companies tend to exceed your expectations. They find investment opportunities that you might not have thought about, or that you wouldn't be able to pursue as an individual, increasing the intrinsic value of their business. Over time, these companies tend to be worth much more than they are today. Long term, our analysts think having a stake in a high-quality company will put you in a far better position than chasing market movements or the brief boom of a low-quality business. With that in mind, here are a group of rock-solid companies that are truly positioned to stand the test of time. Having a stake in a high-quality company will put you in a far better position than chasing market movements or the brief boom of a low-quality business. One of the keys to finding the best long-term investments is buying companies that can stay one step ahead of the competition. Legendary investor Warren Buffett originally coined the term \u201ceconomic moat\u201d to refer to a company\u2019s ability to keep competitors at bay over time. Morningstar builds on this idea to rate companies based on their \u201cmoat,\u201d or the strength and sustainability of their competitive edge. We\u2019ve compiled a list of the best companies our analysts cover that are available to U.S. investors. These companies have successfully carved out wide moats between them and their industry competitors, and we\u2019re confident that they will produce returns that outweigh their costs for the next 20 years or more. In other words, these companies will reliably be able to produce returns for investors over a long period even as they invest in their growth. The strength of their competitive advantages is also either steady or increasing, which adds to our confidence in their long-term growth. A company\u2019s longevity and competitive advantage are inherently tied to sustainability, so our analysis takes environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, considerations into account. The best companies have business models that allow them to effectively navigate evolving ESG issues that could materially impact their business. Cutting corners or taking on too much risk may work in the short run, but these tactics won\u2019t give a company enduring success. The companies that make our list also have predictable cash flows (or predictable amounts of money going into and out of a company), so our analysts can more accurately estimate how much the businesses are worth. These companies also make smart decisions about how they manage and invest their money. We aren\u2019t advocating that you buy shares of every company on this list today. Even the greatest company can be a bad investment if you overpay. The share prices of many companies on this list overestimate their real value, so it may not be the right time to buy. Still, we believe these companies are essential for any stock investor\u2019s watchlist. We\u2019ve grouped the companies on this list according to the overall sectors of the economy in which they compete. Start your free 7-day trial of Morningstar Investor.

Note: If you\u2019re having trouble viewing lists on this page, please try another browser. The consumer defensive sector isn\u2019t what it sounds like. Think brands you find in your home\u2014companies that manufacture household and personal products, food, and beverages. It also includes discount stores. These companies provide services that consumers always need, so changes in the economy, like downturns, generally don\u2019t have much impact on the sector. That\u2019s where the \u201cdefensive\u201d of consumer defensive comes in: The sector isn\u2019t impacted by the ups and downs of the economy. Many of the companies below have strengthened their positions by developing a strong relationship with shoppers and offering either lower prices than their competitors or a strong brand identity that justifies higher pricing. The financial-services sector includes banks, asset managers, financial research and data companies, credit services, investment brokerage firms, stock exchanges, and insurance companies. Just as the services they supply differ, the companies below fend off competition in distinct ways. The most common characteristic among them is that their customers face relatively high hurdles when they want to switch service providers. Many companies in this sector are economically sensitive with interest rates, the level of the stock market, and financial health of consumers and businesses affecting results. Healthcare is another sector that generally holds steady no matter what is happening in the economy. The healthcare sector includes companies in biotechnology, diagnostics and research, drug manufacturing, and health information services.  Planes, trains, and heavy machinery. Companies in the industrials sector support and transport all things industry. The sector includes companies that produce machinery, hand-held tools, and industrial products. It also includes aerospace and defense firms as well as transportation services. More companies from the industrials sector made our list than from any other group. Many of these companies benefit from their incumbent position in their respective industries. It allows these businesses to develop brands and patents that give them their edge. Many further benefit from a cost advantage, operating in industries where infrastructure or regulation limitations make it expensive for new competitors to enter the market. Technology is an area that is infamously ripe for disruptors, but some companies have been able to carve out pockets of stability. Companies in the technology sector are engaged in the design, development, and support of computer operating systems and applications. This sector also includes companies that make computer equipment, data storage products, networking products, semiconductors, and components. Many of the companies that made our list are software application developers that keep their position by providing services with high switching costs. Customers find it difficult to stop using their services because it\u2019s hard to do, expensive, or risky to make the switch. The companies below represent various sectors: basic materials, communication services, consumer cyclical, energy, and utilities. Most of these sectors, except for utilities, ebb and flow with the overall economy, so predicting companies\u2019 cash flows is more difficult. Many of these companies also operate in highly competitive or evolving industries where it can be hard to create a sustainable competitive advantage. The companies on this list are covered by Morningstar Research Services\u2019 equity analysts and have shares available to U.S. investors. This means that Morningstar equity analysts have calculated fair value estimates for the shares of the companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. As a result, most of the companies on this list are based in the United States. Within that coverage list, the best companies meet the following criteria: Companies with moats have one or more of the following characteristics: To\u00a0maintain analysts\u2019 independence,\u00a0Morningstar Research Services does\u00a0not\u00a0publicly\u00a0rate\u00a0its parent company of Morningstar, Inc.

        "body": "Investors from almost every part of the world exhibit a certain amount of home bias: the tendency to prefer domestic equities to international ones. This makes sense. Investors are likely more familiar with these brands and consequently are more comfortable putting their money toward them. But in today\u2019s investing world \u201cadding international exposure is one of the first steps toward a diversified portfolio,\u201d according to Morningstar portfolio strategist Amy Arnott. If, for example, the US dollar weakens, exposure to European or Asian equities can soften the impact. With that in mind, how can stock investors tackle international investing? First, it\u2019s important to remember that at Morningstar, we don\u2019t view investing through the lens of daily price movements or hot tips. We see owning a single stock as similar to owning a small part of the company or the underlying business itself. Consider the amount of effort we devote to researching and comparing options before buying a car. It tends to be a lot, and it tends to work out well for our needs, exceeding expectations and providing a reliable form of transportation. This is the same approach we take to buying a stock. One of the best ways to identify high-quality companies is by checking out the Morningstar Economic Moat Rating, which assesses a company\u2019s competitive advantage. The term \u201ceconomic moat\u201d was coined by Warren Buffett, who said, \u201cThe key to investing is \u2026 determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.\u201d We used the moat rating as a starting point to compile a list of the best companies you can own. As the best companies in our coverage, they have wide economic moat ratings, the strength of their competitive advantages is either steady or increasing, they have predictable cash flows, and they allocate their capital effectively. (You can learn more about this methodology here.) Here are the 35 companies based outside of the United States, but available to US investors, that made the cut. Industrials is the most represented sector on this list with 10 companies. Consumer defensive and healthcare are close behind with nine and seven, respectively. A note of caution: This list is not a call to action for you to buy all these companies immediately. Rather, it is a list of stocks you should keep an eye on and look for attractive entry points. Even the greatest company can be a bad investment if you overpay, and many firms on this list are currently overvalued. That said, we note two of the stocks on the list that earned Morningstar Ratings of 5 stars as of April 19, 2024, meaning they are undervalued according to Morningstar\u2018s fair value estimates. They are Switzerland-based Roche Holding RHHBY, a global pharmaceutical and diagnostic company, and China-based Yum China Holdings YUMC, the country\u2019s largest restaurant chain. Here\u2019s what our analysts have to say about these two undervalued names from the list. \u201cWe think Roche\u2019s drug portfolio and industry-leading diagnostics conspire to create maintainable competitive advantages. As the market leader in both biotech and diagnostics, this Swiss healthcare giant is in a unique position to guide global healthcare into a safer, more personalized, and more cost-effective endeavor. Strong information sharing continues between Genentech and Roche researchers, boosting research and development productivity and personalized medicine offerings that take advantage of Roche\u2019s diagnostic expertise. \u201cRoche\u2019s biologics focus and innovative pipeline are key to the firm\u2019s ability to maintain its wide moat and continue to achieve growth as current blockbusters face competition. Blockbuster cancer biologics Avastin, Rituxan, and Herceptin are seeing strong headwinds from biosimilars. However, Roche\u2019s biologics focus (more than 80% of pharmaceutical sales) provides some buffer against the traditional intense declines from small-molecule generic competition. In addition, with the launch of Perjeta in 2012, Kadcyla in 2013, and Phesgo (a subcutaneous coformulation of Herceptin and Perjeta) in 2020, Roche has somewhat refreshed its breast cancer franchise. Gazyva, approved in CLL and NHL and in testing in lupus, as well as new bispecific antibodies Columvi and Lunsumio will also extend the longevity of the Rituxan blood cancer franchise. Roche\u2019s immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq launched in 2016, and we see peak sales potential above $5 billion. Roche is also expanding outside of oncology with MS drug Ocrevus ($9 billion peak sales) and hemophilia drug Hemlibra ($6 billion peak sales). \u201cRoche\u2019s diagnostics business is also strong. With a 20% share of the global in vitro diagnostics market, Roche holds the number-one rank in this industry over competitors Siemens SIEGY, Abbott ABT, and Ortho. Pricing pressure has been intense in the diabetes-care market, but new instruments and immunoassays have buoyed the core professional diagnostics segment.\u201d \u2014Karen Andersen, strategist \u201cThe covid-19 pandemic provided Yum China the opportunity to accelerate store openings at more favorable lease terms. The company added more than 3,700 locations from 2020 to 2022, equivalent to a 36% increase from 2019. Now that China\u2019s zero-covid-19 policy is in the rearview mirror, we expect these new restaurants to not only deliver significant incremental revenue but also be accretive to the overall margins. Over the next several years, we expect Yum China to speed up new unit openings. We share management\u2019s view that there remain plenty of expansion opportunities in lower-tier cities\u2014evidenced by nearly 1,200 Chinese cities still with no KFC presence. \u201cOver the longer term, we believe there are several opportunities for Yum China to gain a share in the fragmented, USD 700 billion Chinese restaurant market. In China, chains account for roughly 18% of restaurant spending compared with 61% in the US and 34% across the globe. Our conviction in rising fast food penetration is underpinned by three long-term secular trends: longer working hours for urban consumers; rapidly rising disposable income; and ever-smaller family sizes. Coupled with strong brand recognition and an unrivaled supply chain, Yum China is set to be the prime beneficiary of growing Chinese fast-food spending. We\u2019re also optimistic about Yum China\u2019s various top-line drivers, including value platforms, menu innovations, new restaurant formats, enhanced digital marketing efforts (underscored by 300 million loyalty program members), unrivaled delivery capabilities, and nascent brand expansion potential in Lavazza, Taco Bell, and Huang Ji Huang. \u201cAt its 2021 investor day, Yum China management committed a five-year budget of USD 1 billion-USD 1.5 billion to technology and digital development. We believe the company is beginning to reap the fruits of its investments. We believe a significant amount of cost savings will be passed through to the bottom line simply because these investments at scale are not likely to be replicated by competitors. This underpins our forecast for operating margin expansion over the long term.\u201d \u2014Ivan Su, senior equity analyst Editor\u2019s Note: This article is based on the 2024 edition of Morningstar\u2019s Best Companies to Own.

        "body": "\u201cDisruptive innovation\u201d can conjure up images of flying cars, lightsabers, or a brave new world. But these technologies may not be as far off as they seem. Tech companies are using disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence to analyze large, complex datasets. Research and development in the healthcare industry has created lifesaving drug therapies and treatments. And climate change is forcing energy and utilities companies to focus on renewable energy. Investing in such disruptive innovation can be tricky, says Dave Sekera, Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist. \u201cBecause disruptive technology is such a broad, wide-reaching concept, it is difficult to identify companies that fall within the group,\u201d he says. The Morningstar Exponential Technologies Index holds about 200 stocks that Morningstar analysts expect to experience significant economic benefits from using or producing a new technology. The companies covered in this index touch on any combination of nine themes: Big Data and analytics, cloud computing, energy transition, financial technology innovation, healthcare innovation, hyperconnectivity, nanotechnology, next-generation transportation, and robotics. (Explore more about each theme in the index\u2019s rule book.) But which of these companies, representing these nine emerging themes, have the competitive advantages and management teams to thrive? Here are the 18 companies in the Morningstar Exponential Technologies Index that also made our Best Companies to Own list for 2024. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what Morningstar thinks of Broadcom AVGO, which is exposed to four of the nine themes, tied for the most with Analog Devices ADI and Texas Instruments TXN among the companies on our Best Innovative Companies to Own list. Themes: Big Data and analytics, nanotechnology, hyperconnectivity, and cloud computing. Broadcom, which released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report on June 12, 2024, is the sixth-largest semiconductor company globally and has expanded into various software businesses, with over $30 billion in annual revenue. It sells 17 core semiconductor product lines across wireless, networking, broadband, storage, and industrial markets. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split that takes effect on July 15. \u201cBroadcom is an amalgamation of high-value chip and software businesses that on the whole are differentiated and moaty, in our view. Broadcom is a terrific aggregator of firms, big and small. Its ability to acquire and streamline generates strong profits and cash flow and fuels its robust dividend. We laud the firm for its execution and operating efficiency, which build upon its large organic investment and help it to outperform its end markets organically. \u201cIn our view, Broadcom\u2019s networking and wireless chip businesses are its strongest and contribute heavily to the firm\u2019s wide economic moat. We anticipate it maintaining a technological lead in thin-film bulk acoustic resonator, or FBAR, filters, which it sells exclusively into Apple\u2019s AAPL iPhone. We also expect it to maintain product leadership in merchant silicon for switching and routing applications and to defend its strong relationships with heavyweight equipment vendors Cisco Systems CSCO and Arista Networks ANET. Broadcom\u2019s software businesses sell virtualization software, mainframe software, and cybersecurity software, and we see its offerings as highly competitive. Broadcom\u2019s focus on strategic large software customers like financial institutions, governments, and large enterprises\u2014where it is deeply embedded\u2014elicits steep switching costs. We also see upselling opportunities with VMware under the firm\u2019s belt. \u201cGoing forward, we see Broadcom benefiting from moderate, steady growth from data center networking, Apple unit sales, and upselling for its software customers. We believe artificial intelligence will become a material organic driver to the networking business, as applications like large language models require advanced network switching, where Broadcom\u2019s chips are best-of-breed. We expect acquisitions to still be on Broadcom\u2019s radar but perhaps with larger, less frequent deals. After closing on VMware in 2023, we expect the firm to focus on deleveraging for a couple of years before tapping back into the acquisition market.\u201d \u2014William Kerwin, Morningstar equity analyst Find the full list of companies and read about our selection methodology."

        "body": "Financial-services companies provide a wide range of vital services to millions of people\u2014including credit cards, wealth and asset management, and products and research to make investing easier. Banks, asset managers, credit-services providers, and financial data providers can gain a competitive edge\u2014resulting in a wide Morningstar Economic Moat Rating\u2014for a variety of reasons. One is switching costs: Once established with a bank or asset manager, for example, customers are unlikely to leave. Another edge is the network effect: The more people who use a credit card or index, the more valuable it becomes. Cost advantages come with size and scope. Then there are intangible assets, such as brand names that inspire customer confidence. Here, we highlight the 17 financial-services companies that made our Best Companies to Own list for 2024. These companies earned their spot on the list by carving out wide moats and making smart decisions with their capital. Because this list is built for the long term, rather than to identify presently undervalued companies, it may not be the right time to buy all these names. Still, we believe they are strong choices for an investor\u2019s watchlist. The largest banks benefit from cost advantages as well as high switching costs for customers and clients. Preeminent among them is JPMorgan Chase JPM. \u201cWith leading investment bank, commercial bank, credit card, retail bank, and asset and wealth management franchises, JPMorgan is truly a force to be reckoned with,\u201d writes Morningstar equity analyst Suryansh Sharma. \u201cThe bank\u2019s combination of scale, diversification, and sound risk management seems like a simple path to competitive advantage, but few other firms have been able to execute a similar strategy.\u201d JPMorgan also boasts a Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating of Exemplary. Management has made smart investment decisions. For example, the firm avoided the mortgage-backed securities that afflicted many other banks during the global financial crisis, while investing wisely elsewhere. \u201cOver the last decade-plus,\u201d notes Sharma, \u201cJPMorgan\u2019s acquisitions, organic growth investments, and internal technology investments have built the most dominant US banking franchise.\u201d Bank of America BAC, the second-largest US money-center bank, is one of the top deposit-gatherers and a leader in retail mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and small-business lending. It also has one of the largest online retail brokerages and largest advisor forces through Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. \u201cOverall, we believe the bank\u2019s key advantage comes from its scale in certain fixed-cost, fixed-platform businesses and the breadth of products it can offer to clients,\u201d writes Sharma. This leads to sustainable cost advantages and creates switching costs for customers. \u201cPayment networks such as Visa V benefit, unsurprisingly, from a network effect,\u201d writes Morningstar senior analyst Brett Horn. \u201cThe more consumers that are plugged into a payment network, the more attractive that payment network becomes for merchants, which in turn makes the network more convenient for consumers, and so on.\u201d The same can be said for Mastercard MA. These companies have developed two of the largest payment networks, insulating them from competition. These large networks also create cost advantages. American Express AXP is much smaller, but it has the advantage of a differentiated operating model. \u201cAmerican Express issues the credit card to the consumer, operates the payment network, and establishes a direct relationship with the merchant,\u201d writes Morningstar analyst Michael Miller. \u201cBy operating as a closed-loop network, American Express can capture the full economic profit from a single credit card payment.\u201d Similar to credit card companies, financial data providers benefit from network effects. Those with established reputations, track records, and relationships also have intangible assets that make it difficult for newcomers to compete and create switching costs for customers. S&P Global SPGI benefits from such advantages on several fronts, writes equity analyst Rajiv Bhatia. \u201cWhether through credit ratings, financial indexes, or commodity price reporting, S&P Global has established a wide moat from its data-driven benchmarks. Given the embedded nature of these benchmarks, S&P enjoys a strong competitive position and strong operating margins.\u201d Moody\u2019s MCO is a market leader, alongside S&P Global, in providing credit ratings on fixed-income securities. Bank of New York Mellon BK owes its wide moat to its custody business, built on cost advantages and switching costs. Find the full list of companies and read about our selection methodology."

        "body": "Companies with wide moats are difficult to compete with. This advantage is especially appealing when paired with solid management of environmental, social, and governance risks. In other words, durability and sustainability, also called ESG, are natural partners. ESG keeps a close eye on long-term risks that aren\u2019t articulated by traditional finance. All companies face some sustainability risk, not least because of the industries in which they operate. For example, an oil and gas company will be highly exposed to potential environmental problems, while a consumer technology business will be exposed to social risks like data privacy violations. Indeed, Morningstar\u2019s research finds that the biggest ESG risk is in energy and utilities, with the smallest in technology and real estate. A company\u2019s approach to sustainability demonstrates how it anticipates and addresses these long-term risks. Companies that mishandle ESG issues could incur significant economic costs that jeopardize their ability to earn long-term, maintainable profits. Morningstar Sustainalytics measures this with the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating. It considers two main factors\u2014exposure, or a company\u2019s vulnerability to ESG risk, and management, which describes the actions taken by a company to manage a particular ESG issue\u2014and blends them into a single score. The lower the number, the lower the risk. In the table below, we refined our Best Companies to Own in 2024 list to highlight the ones with Morningstar ESG Risk Rating Assessments of Negligible or Low. This rating is based on the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating. We didn\u2019t include valuations for these companies. Rather, we focused on the criteria that set a company up for success in the long term. So, while not all of these names can be considered a buy today, this can serve as a great watchlist. Here are the 77 companies that made the cut, ranked by the risk score. A score of 0.00-9.99 is Negligible; a score of 10.00-19.99 is Low. You can explore the ESG Risk Rating score of each company under Morningstar coverage in the Sustainability tab of its stock quote page on Morningstar.com. Keysight Technologies is the leader in communications testing and measurement solutions. We think it has the strongest and broadest communications testing capabilities in the market across hardware, software, and services. Its wide Morningstar Economic Moat Rating, according to analyst William Kerwin, owes to \u201cintangible assets in the design of test and measurement equipment and software and switching costs for its portfolio of solutions.\u201d Because of Keysight\u2019s strong ESG reporting and oversight of ESG issues, Sustainalytics gives the company an ESG Risk Management rating of Strong. Sustainalytics notes that the firm has implemented a strong whistleblower program, has an adequate policy governing environmental issues, and employs solid social supply chain standards. Keysight\u2019s greatest material ESG issue is the risk of losing human capital to competitors, but we don\u2019t think this is likely to happen, and we think the firm\u2019s strong variable compensation program helps retain talent. The only recent controversy attributed to Keysight is an investigation into alleged patent infringement practices. Still, this incident had minimal impact on Sustainalytics\u2019 broader analysis of the firm\u2019s ESG practices. UK-based RELX is a global provider of business information, analytics, and decision-making tools for professionals across industries. The firm generates revenue mainly by creating and selling access to curated information databases, analytics, and journals. Morningstar senior analyst Rob Hales assigns RELX a wide economic moat based on intangible assets, switching costs, and a cost advantage. Sustainalytics gives RELX an ESG Risk Management rating of Strong. The firm has a global head of ESG and corporate responsibility who provides updates to the board and engages with senior managers on key ESG issues. And in fiscal-year 2022, the annual incentive for RELX\u2019s CEO and CFO included performance on nonfinancial measures, including targets linked to carbon reduction and socially responsible suppliers. Because RELX\u2019s revenue comes primarily from products and services in electronic formats, its main risks include exposure to elevated data privacy and security risks. Noncompliance with data privacy laws and regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, could result in litigation and regulatory fines. Furthermore, cyberattacks could lead to operational disruptions and substantial remediation costs. Consulting firm Accenture\u2019s risk is mainly related to its exposure to cyberattacks and its dependency on specialized talent, such as IT consultants and engineers, as it tries to keep up with client demand. Accenture is taking sustainability considerations seriously. Accenture CEO Julie Sweet noted during a quarterly call that sustainability \u201cis a critical area for which technology is still evolving. \u2026 We believe that every business must be a sustainable business, and yet companies are at very early stages of figuring out how to make this shift.\u201d Sustainalytics gives Accenture an ESG Risk Management rating of Strong. The board has a comprehensive data privacy policy. To attract and keep employees, Accenture has set gender and racial diversity targets and provides same-sex and gender-transition benefits. It is building employee skills in high-demand technologies like the cloud. Morningstar analyst Julie Bhusal Sharma cites Accenture\u2019s strong reputation for reliability and its \u201ctreasure trove of institutionalized industry expertise and experience.\u201d Accenture\u2019s technological and strategic know-how, paired with its attention to sustainability considerations, is helping bolster profits. Accenture\u2019s operating margin for fiscal-year 2023 was 15.4%, which we expect to expand to 16.5% by fiscal year 2028. A spot on this list doesn\u2019t mean that a company\u2019s sustainability efforts are flawless. For example, though Sustainalytics has assigned Experian EXPGY an overall ESG Risk Rating of Low, multiple data security incidents in the United States and Experian\u2019s international subsidiaries have resulted in a Sustainalytics Controversy Rating of Significant. The frequency of these incidents has contributed to operational and reputational risk, as shareholders and customers may lose confidence in the company\u2019s management. Even so, Experian holds a spot in our catalog of sustainable companies because it is on the right track to improve data privacy and cybersecurity programs. The firm has started reporting according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards, which is a best practice, and has improved its quality management system to ensure secure data management. It also has Negligible risk ratings in the areas of business ethics and product governance. Remember, this list is about long-term sustainability, not valuations. For guidance in that area, you can look to the Morningstar US Sustainability Moat Focus Index. From that perspective, not all the names in this catalog of low-ESG-risk companies with wide moat ratings can be considered a buy at the moment. Still, for investors interested in managing long-term ESG risks, they\u2019re worth keeping a close eye on. This article is based on the 2024 edition of Morningstar\u2019s Best Companies to Own. Here is the full list of companies and our selection methodology. "

        "body": "Morningstar Manager Research\u2019s latest list of overlooked or emerging fund managers and strategies includes offerings from three industry stalwarts. Here\u2019s a look at four of the 11 strategies the team added to the July 2024 Morningstar Prospects list. This international small-cap strategy launched in November 2020 (via a separate account), shortly after managers Beini Zhou and Anand Vasagiri joined Artisan Partners; the mutual fund later launched in May 2022. Zhou and Vasagiri are boomerang Artisan employees who previously worked as analysts under David Samra on foreign large-cap offering Artisan International Value APHKX, which has a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold, before leaving for portfolio management opportunities elsewhere. Zhou worked for Matthews Asia from 2013 to 2020, successfully managing a few non-US small-cap mandates; Vasagiri was a portfolio manager at Paradice Investment Management from 2010 until 2019. The managers sit within Samra\u2019s international value group at Artisan, though they operate independently. Like the broader team, Zhou and Vasagiri seek stocks trading at big discounts to their intrinsic value estimates but also emphasize quality firms with financial strength and shareholder-oriented management. That has resulted in a portfolio landing in the core section of the Morningstar Style Box. The strategy is concentrated, typically owning between 20 and 40 stocks, with position sizes sometimes approaching 10% of assets. Like most Artisan offerings, fees rank among the most expensive in the peer group. T. Rowe Price Global Multi-Sector Bond Fund\u2019s team employs a unique approach and boasts an enviable track record. The fund\u2019s manager duo averages 15 years of industry experience and brings strong foreign-currency market experience. Lead manager Kenneth Orchard, who has been with the firm for 13 years, took over this strategy in 2018. In mid-2019, the team hired an external associate manager with 10 years of industry experience to support Orchard. The team draws on T. Rowe Price\u2019s fixed-income sector managers, credit analysts, traders, quantitative analysts, and economists. While Orchard is the sole named manager, his team includes five sector portfolio managers specializing in asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities (both commercial and residential), global investment-grade, global high-yield and loans, and emerging-markets corporate sectors. A well-structured and well-executed process considers both top-down and bottom-up research for security selection, sector allocation, and duration management. Daily interactions between managers and analysts focus on portfolio characteristics and risk assessment. While Orchard guides positioning, sizing, and macro views, sector managers handle sector allocation and security selection. The portfolio takes on more credit risk than typical peers, with a maximum of 65% in below-investment-grade debt. Its 27.3% of the assets (as of June 2024) in non-investment-grade debt is more than its global bond-USD hedged Morningstar Category peer median, giving it a yield advantage. The sector strategy advisor group plays a pivotal role in assessing credit risk and making strategic decisions. Performance stands out since Orchard took the reins. Over Orchard\u2019s tenure since February 2018, the fund\u2019s I shares\u2019 2.4% return through June 2024 ranks in its category\u2019s top decile and beat the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index\u2019s 1.5%. On a risk-adjusted basis (as measured by Sharpe ratio), the fund landed in the top decile during the same period. Voya Target Retirement series combines high-quality third-party exchange-traded funds with the firm\u2019s own actively managed funds to produce cost-effective blended portfolios. The series\u2019 taps well-regarded index ETFs from providers such as iShares and Vanguard, as well as active funds managed by Voya and its subadvisors. For example, Silver-rated Nuveen S&P 500 Index TISPX anchors the equity sleeve, while Silver-rated Voya Intermediate Bond IIBZ and Gold-rated iShares Core US Aggregate Bond AGG make up the bulk of the series\u2019 fixed-income allocation. As of June 2024, 87% of the series\u2019 assets sits in funds that earn Morningstar Medalist Ratings of Silver or higher. At 25 basis points, its price is attractive compared with Voya\u2019s Solution series, which costs more than twice that amount. The Target Retirement series is one of four target-date offerings overseen by the firm\u2019s multi-asset strategies and solutions team, all of which share the same glide path and allocation process. At 95% equity, the glide path is more aggressive than peers in longer-dated (2065, 2060) target retirement year portfolios, as it aims to maximize growth while participants have a long investment time horizon. The glide path becomes more conservative than the average peer as investors approach retirement, aiming to provide better downside protection. The gap is widest at retirement, when Voya allocates 35% to stocks versus the average peer at 46%. Management takes the same active approach to asset allocation applied across Voya\u2019s suite of target-date products. At least once per year, the team reviews its long-term capital market assumptions, which inform the series\u2019 strategic asset-class and sub-asset-class exposures. Lead manager Barbara Reinhard has support from a four-member asset-allocation team to implement measured, but frequent, short-term tactical allocation changes driven by fundamentals, valuation, and sentiment. WisdomTree US Value ETF systematically collects companies offering the best combination of shareholder yield and quality. Shareholder yield measures the total payout stockholders receive via dividends and net buybacks. Screening for companies with a high total payout and favorable quality measures should result in a portfolio of sound businesses that are returning cash to shareholders. The quality screen excludes stocks with unsustainable payouts that could be riskier and keeps turnover down. The merits of a shareholder-yield strategy are disputed. On one hand, dividend-focused portfolios tend to concentrate in steady value names whose earnings stability can provide a long-term advantage. On the other hand, buyback-focused portfolios back into quality stocks but often have high turnover because firms start and stop buybacks opportunistically. Combining dividends and buybacks with measures that home in on sound businesses could offer investors an appealing combination of downside protection and growth potential. The fund has fared better than dividend- or buyback-only funds since it adopted its current strategy in December 2017. It also outpaced the Russell 1000 Value Index in that time. Incorporating buybacks increases risk compared with the benchmark and steadier dividend-only funds, but the fund has had a substantial risk-adjusted return advantage against most peers and relevant benchmarks."

        "body": "Investors gravitate to small-company stocks for a couple of reasons. Some want a dose of small companies in their portfolios to round out their exposure to the large-company stocks that dominate the market. Other investors may want to tilt their portfolios toward small caps after a long period of large-cap outperformance. The Morningstar US Large Cap Index has outperformed the Morningstar US Small Cap Index during the trailing three-, five-, and 10-year periods by significant margins. Notably, though, small caps have gained twice as much as large-cap stocks during the past month as of mid-July. Given how undervalued small-cap stocks look today and their long-term underperformance, they certainly could have more room to run. Before adding a small-company stock fund to your portfolio mix, make sure you don\u2019t already have plenty of exposure to small-company stocks through the funds you own; Morningstar Investor\u2019s Portfolio Manager can help you determine your portfolio\u2019s current small-cap stock stake. While there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d allocation to small-company stocks, less than 10% of the US equity market\u2019s capitalization is in small companies, notes Morningstar portfolio strategist Amy Arnott. That suggests small-cap funds should play pretty limited roles in an investment portfolio. If you find your portfolio is lighter in small-company stocks than you\u2019d like, you can turn to our shortlist of the best small-cap mutual funds and exchange-traded funds for ideas to investigate further. These ETFs and mutual funds all land in one of the US small-cap Morningstar Categories and have at least one share class that earned our top Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold with 100% analyst coverage as of July 16, 2024. You\u2019ll find both passive funds and active funds on our list of the best small-company funds. Passive strategies have several things going for them. First, of course, is their cost advantage: All of our Gold-rated index funds carry below-average expense ratios, which give them a lower hurdle to jump over to generate returns. Moreover, index funds tend to be more tax-efficient than active funds, which is a benefit for investors in taxable accounts. Finally, index funds are less threatened by asset growth than active funds. That being said, the small-cap part of the market is an area where some active managers have been able to add value versus their respective indexes. But investors who are considering active funds, take note: Active funds that focus on less-liquid parts of the market, such as the small-cap space, sometimes close to new investors. Why? Capacity is critical for many small-cap funds to maintain their approaches. As such, the best small-cap funds may close or otherwise limit new investments on occasion to keep their focus intact. You can find out whether a fund is limiting new investment by taking a look at its report on Morningstar.com; check the Status data point on a fund\u2019s Quote page. Some of the names on our list of the best small-cap funds invest strictly in growth stocks, others favor value stocks, and still others blend the two. Consult a fund\u2019s Analyst Report to learn more about its strategy. Given their high Medalist Ratings, we expect the top-rated small-cap stock mutual funds and ETFs on our list to outperform over a full market cycle. However, investors may want to expand their search for small-cap funds beyond this list, using parameters that matter to them. Here are three additional ways to find small-company ETFs and mutual funds to investigate further. These bond ETFs and mutual funds earn Morningstar\u2019s top rating. These dividend ETFs and mutual funds earn high ratings from Morningstar. These growth stock mutual funds and ETFs earn top ratings from Morningstar. Looking for low-cost index funds to invest in? These mutual funds and ETFs earn Morningstar\u2019s top rating. These international mutual funds and ETFs all earn Morningstar Medalist Ratings of Gold. These top-rated mutual funds and ETFs make excellent long-term core holdings. These mutual funds and ETFs invest in value stocks and earn top ratings from Morningstar. These top-rated Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds are excellent choices to buy and hold in 2024 and beyond. "

        "body": "Investor discomfort in handling financial issues is one of the most common reasons that they hire a financial advisor, according to recent research from our team. It\u2019s not just about increasing returns. For example, one respondent told us, \u201cThe market can be a daunting place and [my advisor] help[s] me navigate based on my needs. I would rather trust someone with expertise than learn on my own.\u201d This response encapsulates the thought process of many investors who\u2019ve hired a financial advisor. Clients recognize they don\u2019t have the time, knowledge, or resources to make the best decisions for their finances themselves. There\u2019s good reason to seek out help when facing discomfort with finances. On top of being unpleasant, worrying about finances can also lead to people feeling generalized psychological distress, and people who are stressed by their finances are more likely to exhibit signs of depression. Unfortunately, having money is not enough to resolve the strain that financial stress can put on someone\u2019s mental well-being. People\u2019s subjective perception of their wealth is not always linked with their monetary reality\u2014which means that even if someone is well-off, they are not immune to the feeling the stress of their finances and the negative downstream effects. To answer the question, let\u2019s look to the ABC-X model of stress, which examines how a stressor, A, leads to a stressful (or not stressful) outcome, X. This model can help explain why different clients react differently to the same financial stressors and what advisors can do to alleviate the strain those stressors can cause. Here\u2019s how this model works: In this model, any given stressor can lead to a good outcome if people have the right resources and perception of the stressor. Financial advisors can help with both of these factors. A financial advisor is another resource that people can draw upon when they are confronted by a stressor. Advisors can help them execute actions, explain important considerations, and more. But what may be less obvious is that advisors can also help shape investors\u2019 perceptions of the stressor through behavioral coaching. Advisors can help clients see new opportunities in the situation, provide perspective, and help clients identify the strengths they have that can help them cope with the stressor. To that end, we recommend that advisors who want to convert prospects into lifelong clients speak to their need for peace of mind from the start. This can involve highlighting how your expertise can reduce decision-making anxiety and provide clarity on different investment options. It may also include emphasizing your commitment to build a financial plan that will help them reach their goals. But a particularly effective way to help clients see how you will help them achieve peace of mind is through storytelling\u2014that is, providing compelling anecdotes from previous client interactions. To do so, I recommend using the ABC-X model as a framework for your story. This framework will help you show prospects how you act as a resource and provide perspective to clients when they\u2019re confronted with stressors."

        "body": "Editor\u2019s note: Today, the reciprocal of the cyclically adjusted price earnings, or CAPE, ratio (1/CAPE) is the metric many investors use to estimate the long-term expected real return of the stock market. This metric is known as the cyclically adjusted earnings yield, or CAEY. In their 1988 research paper, \u201cStock Prices, Earnings, and Expected Dividends,\u201d John Campbell and Robert Shiller introduced the use of the CAPE ratio to forecast long-term stock market returns. Since then, the CAPE 10 (the 10-year average for earnings adjusted for inflation) has been used to estimate future equity returns. However, employing a 10-year average for earnings, instead of the most current 12-month earnings, wasn\u2019t new. It was first suggested by legendary value investors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. In their classic 1934 book, Security Analysis, Graham and Dodd noted that traditionally reported price/earnings ratios can vary considerably because earnings are strongly influenced by the business cycle. To control for the cyclical effects, Graham and Dodd recommended dividing price by a multiyear average of earnings and suggested periods of five, seven, or 10 years. Providing support for the CAPE 10, in his 2016 study, \u201cPredicting Stock Market Returns Using the Shiller CAPE\u2014An Improvement Towards Traditional Value Indicators?,\u201d Norbert Keimling concluded that it was possible to forecast potential long-term returns in the S&P 500 for periods of more than 10 years (he examined periods of up to 15 years) using the CAPE 10 and that the relationship also existed internationally in 17 MSCI country indexes: \u201cIn all countries a relationship between fundamental valuation and subsequent long\u2010term returns can be observed.\u201d The following chart shows the historical relationship between CAEY and the next 10 years\u2019 real return of the US stock market. Victor Haghani and James White, authors of the June 2024 paper, \u201cIntroducing P-CAPE: Incorporating the Dividend Payout Ratio Improves Investors\u2019 Favorite Estimator of Stock Market Returns,\u201d sought to determine if the CAPE could be improved upon. They began by noting: \u201cA shortcoming of Shiller and Campbell\u2019s definition of cyclically-adjusted earnings is that it doesn\u2019t take account of the fact that, in general, companies don\u2019t pay out all their earnings as dividends each year. The fraction of earnings not paid out in dividends is either reinvested in the business or paid out via stock buybacks. Reinvesting earnings in the business is done in the expectation of growing future earnings, and this earnings growth should ideally be accounted for when smoothing earnings over the previous ten years for the purpose of predicting long-term future earnings.\u201d Their hypothesis was that a better measure of cyclically adjusted earnings is one that accounts \u201cfor the logic that retained earnings should increase earnings per share over time (whether through investment in the business or through share buybacks) in addition to the inflation adjustment already part of Campbell and Shiller\u2019s measure.\u201d They called their modified measure \u201cpayout and cyclically-adjusted earnings,\u201d or P-CAE. The earnings yield is used to compute what they called \u201cP-CAEY\u201d and the price/earnings multiple \u201cP-CAPE.\u201d \u201cFor example: if, 10 years ago, the dividend payout ratio was 60%, real earnings on the stock market index were $10, and the CAEY was 6%, the payout-adjusted earnings we\u2019d use would be: 60% \u2217 $10 + 40% \u2217 $10 \u2217 (1+6%)10 = $13.2. We then take the average of each of those ten years of payout and inflation-adjusted earnings.\u201d They noted: \u201cFor dividend payout ratios of less than 100% and for positive earnings yields, P-CAE will be higher than Shiller and Campbell\u2019s cyclically-adjusted earnings, which are only adjusted for inflation. From 1890 through May 2024, this new payout and cyclically-adjusted earnings metric was, on average, 19% higher than the standard cyclically-adjusted earnings metric.\u201d Following is a summary of their key findings: The chart shows P-CAEY and the next 10-year US real stock market returns. It is impossible to build an investment plan without estimating the returns to stocks (as well as to bonds and any alternative investments). One reason is that the estimate of returns determines your need to take risk\u2014how high an allocation to equities and other risky assets you will need to reach your goal. If your estimate is too high, it\u2019s likely you won\u2019t have sufficient assets to reach your retirement goal. If it\u2019s too low, it could lead you to allocate more to equities, which means taking more risk than necessary. Alternatively, it could lead you to lower your goal, save more, or plan on working longer. Unfortunately, many mistakes are made when looking at the historical record of the CAPE 10 (or any other measure) in terms of its forecasting accuracy. Perhaps the most common error is to consider the CAPE 10 not useful because there is much error in the forecast\u2014there are still very wide dispersions of returns. In their 2017 paper \u201cThe Many Colours of CAPE,\u201d Robert Shiller and Farouk Jivraj found that the CAPE 10 was a better predictor than any of the alternatives considered, and it provided valuable information. As you can see in the table below, they found that 10-year-forward average real returns dropped nearly monotonically as starting Shiller P/Es increased. They also found that as the starting Shiller CAPE 10 ratio increased, worst cases became worse and best cases became weaker. However, it\u2019s important to focus on not just the average returns, but the worst and best cases as well. For example: As tests of robustness, Shiller and Jivraj also found that the CAPE 10 had explanatory power for both sector and individual stock returns. What can we learn from the preceding data? First, starting valuations clearly matter, and they matter a lot. Higher starting values mean that not only are future expected returns lower, but the best outcomes are lower and the worst outcomes are worse. The reverse is true as well\u2014lower starting values mean that not only are future expected returns higher, but the best outcomes are higher and the worst outcomes are less poor, too. However, it\u2019s also extremely important to understand that a wide dispersion of potential outcomes, for which we must prepare when developing an investment plan, still exists\u2014high (low) starting valuations don\u2019t necessarily result in poor (good) outcomes. In other words, investors should not think of a forecast as a single point estimate, but only as the mean of a wide potential dispersion of returns. The main reason for the wide dispersion is that risk premiums are time varying (if they were not, there would be no risk in investing!). It is the time-varying risk premium, what John Bogle called the \u201cspeculative return,\u201d that leads to the wide dispersion in outcomes. The fact that a wide dispersion of returns occurs around the mean forecast is why a Monte Carlo simulation is a valuable planning tool. While the input includes an estimated return, it also recognizes the risks of that mean forecast not being achieved\u2014which is why volatility is another input. Because most simulators allow you to examine thousands of alternative universes, they enable you to test the durability of your plan\u2014you can see the odds of success (such as not running out of money or leaving an estate of a certain size) across various asset allocations and spending rates. The time-varying risk premium is also why an investment plan should include a Plan B, a contingency plan that lists the actions to take if financial assets were to drop below a predetermined level. Actions might include remaining in, or returning to, the workforce, reducing current spending, reducing the financial goal, selling a home and/or moving to a location with a lower cost of living. The bottom line is that CAPE\u2019s explanatory power provides significant information that investors can use to build plans. However, you must not make the mistake of overestimating the forecasting power of the CAPE 10 metric (or the new P-CAPE) and treat that forecast as what will happen. Instead, it should be used to help determine your need to take risk and then, with the understanding that risk premiums are time varying and a wide dispersion of potential outcomes is likely, to help build a plan B. Another mistake investors make when criticizing the use of the CAPE 10 is that it doesn\u2019t work as a timing tool. While valuations do provide information on future returns, the research has found that they do not provide information that allows investors to profitably time the market. For example, Cliff Asness, Swati Chandra, Antti Ilmanen, and Ronen Israel, authors of the study \u201cContrarian Factor Timing Is Deceptively Difficult,\u201d found \u201clackluster results\u201d when investigating the impact of value timing (in other words, whether dynamic allocations can improve the performance of a diversified, multistyle portfolio). They wrote: \u201cStrategic diversification turns out to be a tough benchmark to beat.\u201d Despite the evidence, many investors ignore the findings and try to use CAPE 10 valuations to time markets. They might shift from stocks to bonds when the CAPE 10 is above its long-term average and shift from US to international when international valuations are lower (as they have been for a number of years now). As we just discussed, this has not worked well. However, blaming the CAPE 10 for its failure as a timing tool is like blaming the fork for its failure as a useful tool to eat soup. It is not intended to be used to time markets, only to forecast mean expected returns. Consider the following example. Using data from AQR Capital Management, as of the end of the 2023, the CAPE 10 earnings yield was 3.5% for the US, 5.5% for developed non-US markets, and 7.1% for emerging markets. Some investors take this to mean you should underweight US stocks and overweight emerging markets. This is the wrong use of the CAPE 10 for the simple reason that doing so ignores risk. It\u2019s the equivalent of saying junk bonds with higher yields are better investments than US Treasury bonds with lower yields. The information provided is that investors believe international stocks are riskier, and thus they have higher expected (not guaranteed) returns as compensation for that risk. It\u2019s important to always keep in mind that the efficiency of the markets means that all risky assets should have similar risk-adjusted returns. Thus, your starting point when determining your asset allocation should be the global market capitalization, which is currently about one half US, three eighths developed non-US, and one eighth emerging markets. Having set your asset allocation, you should stick with it, rebalancing as needed. While Campbell and Shiller\u2019s CAPE has provided valuable information as to expected returns, Haghani and White have found an improved tool for investors to use when estimating future returns. However, it\u2019s important that the information be used in the right way, as misusing it can lead to bad outcomes and the failure of plans. You should not use a valuation metric in a deterministic way (that is, \u201cI\u2019m going to earn x percent\u201d). Instead, the forecast should only be used in a probabilistic manner. And you should not use valuations to time the market, shifting allocations toward higher expected returning assets."

        "body": "If there\u2019s a conversation about baseball, the New York Yankees are quick to be mentioned. When the topic is financial planning, similar logic applies to Michael Kitces\u2014a name that\u2019s quick to bubble to the surface. Self-titled as \u201cChief Financial Planning Nerd,\u201d Kitces has built a loyal following among financial advisors for being a one-stop shop for financial planning knowledge. His website operates like a library for financial planning, holding information on nearly every aspect of the discipline. Advisor business models, compensation structures, client acquisition, succession planning\u2014Kitces has extensive knowledge, which is why advisors often seek out his opinion. His work has gone a long way in making advisors better and more successful. This is why he was a natural selection to be a keynote speaker at the recent Morningstar Investment Conference, where he covered five key trends currently influencing the advice industry. These trends included: Kitces concluded by asking advisors one simple question: \u201cWhat are you going to spend the next 10 years being the best at, so that when someone searches a problem online, you become the answer?\u201d Morningstar Wealth Chief Investment Officer Philip Straehl had the opportunity to sit down with Kitces on June 27 in Chicago for a more in-depth exploration of these major themes shaping the future of financial advice. The conversation covered aspects of how financial advisors are differentiating, the role of technology, an industry shifting from products to advice, direct indexing, and the increasing importance of specialization to stand out in a competitive market. An edited version of that conversation follows. Philip Straehl: Your keynote presentation covered five key trends in the financial planning industry. Which trend do you feel will be the most impactful over the next five years? Michael Kitces: Differentiation. There is a huge need for it, and it will be interesting to see the way the industry starts to change as we solve for that. Essentially, what happens when more advisors start pursuing specializations, niches, and various ways to focus in on their ideal client profile? If you look at the industry at large, more than 70% of advisors say they differentiate through above-average client service. But that math doesn\u2019t work\u201470% of advisors can\u2019t be above-average. When I look at a marketplace today, we\u2019ve had this collective shift from selling products to providing advice. I joke that advisors stock the shelves with the knowledge between their ears. That\u2019s the shelf I sell now, not my company\u2019s product shelf. My value proposition is built around advice, not product distribution. And the industry is catching up. There are 100,000 CFPs [Certified Financial Planners], and the number is growing, gaining momentum. The CFP Board had its largest class of new CFPs over the past 12 months. It\u2019s their 51st year, and they\u2019re setting a new record, which to me indicates they are on the uptick of the S-curve of adoption. So, advice has been mainstreamed, and it\u2019s only gaining more momentum. What you see in the new industry participants coming in is remarkable: Merrill Lynch is basically a giant RIA. Vanguard has 700 advisors in their RIA division. Schwab and Fidelity have giant RIAs. When did we ever think the unified fiduciary front would be Merrill Lynch, Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard? But that\u2019s literally how the deck chairs are being rearranged now. And so that creates all sorts of pressures around how you really differentiate. The specialization model exists in pretty much every other profession out there. The generalist makes less than the specialist in medicine, law, and accounting. Straehl: Are there any great examples you\u2019ve seen of that recently with specialization? I think it was probably over five years ago I heard you on a podcast where you were talking about an advisor that specialized in bass fishermen. Kitces: It\u2019s still my favorite example\u2014that advisor is still doing that; it\u2019s awesome. But the short answer is it\u2019s almost anything. A very basic rule of thumb is that any financial advisor can have a wildly successful practice with 50 great clients. Most of us stack up higher because we take on some nonideal clients and then feel guilty about letting them go. But the simple math is like 50 great clients is ample, and many can do it with even less than that. And so, when you have a small number of great clients almost anything works as long as they have enough financial wherewithal to pay you for advice. People specialize in various professions\u2014doctors, lawyers, architects, bass fishermen, right? You need something where enough money goes around that you can get paid for advice. Some advisors specialize in particular problems or transitions; newlyweds and divorcees are examples of situations where there\u2019s life and money in motion. Straehl: You talked about technology as an enabling function. What role do you think technology should play in an advisor\u2019s practice today? Kitces: The rise of software is an obvious adoption trend. Software that manages portfolio models at the client and account level, aggregated across a household or an advisor\u2019s practice at the firm level, is becoming increasingly common. This includes various levels of separate managed accounts, uniform managed accounts, model marketplaces, and rebalancing software. Each of these has a slightly different use case and terminology, but they all functionally achieve the same thing. It took until we reached this stage of technology for a professional manager to manage a chunk of money for multiple clients without pooling it into one bucket. This was essentially what the mutual fund did, which was the only model available from the 1920s until the 2000s. Over the past 20 years, technology has advanced to the point where we can use the same software to manage mutual funds on a disaggregated basis\u2014one client at a time, one account at a time\u2014grouped by clients, household, advisor, firm, etc. Ultimately, this technology opened pathways that just didn\u2019t exist before and could not have existed without it. Straehl: Staying on the technology theme: What are your thoughts on AI? How will it impact the financial advice business? Kitces: Fundamentally, I\u2019m very bullish on technology of all sorts for advisors and the ways that it lifts productivity and reshapes what we do as advisors. But that said, I\u2019m very skeptical of AI, which is probably too harsh because that\u2019s like being a skeptic of computers. We\u2019re all products of our own life experiences, and my broader AI skepticism is having started out my career during the tech boom and having seen many other mini-innovation cycles along the way. (Kitces elaborated that the start of his career coincided with the dot-com bubble. From the dot-com bubble market trough, it took 13 years to reach new market highs. He hinted that the excitement around AI shares similarity traits with that period in terms of euphoria.) The key point I\u2019d make is that we often overextrapolate the capabilities of new technologies. Over time, this tendency fades, and we focus on more practical use cases of what these technologies can actually do. I do think there are some cool ones that will crop up, like meeting notes and related functions postmeeting, which are clearly a prime example of where AI has been effective. AI can generate meeting notes in an instant and then create the follow-up task in a CRM to open a Roth IRA (as just one example) and assign it to the right people. This is a super cool use case and has a very material impact for advisors in terms of efficiency. According to our data, the average advisor spends one hour of prep and follow-up for every hour of meeting time with clients. So, trimming that down is a major productivity enhancer. Straehl: Pivoting from technology, I heard you talk about a research breakthrough around the introduction of flexibility into the financial planning process. I was hoping you could unpack that idea. What does that mean? How does introducing flexibility help advisors? Kitces: This is still a challenge. We are starting to develop some tools around this, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re entirely there yet. There are a few layers to this. The first is that financial planning is premised on the idea, \u201cTell me your goals, and I\u2019ll solve for the most efficient way to get there.\u201d If the advisor is good, they can solve for it. But an issue is that many people don\u2019t know what their financial goals even are. They\u2019ve never spent time thinking about it and can\u2019t articulate them. They often pluck goals out of thin air that they\u2019ve seen in the media or heard in their personal world, such as \u201cage 65 and a million dollars.\u201d These goals are usually tied to the age of 65 being the Medicare age, and a million dollars seems like a round number. The second challenge around flexibility is that there are significant gaps in the tools available to address it. A particular version of this issue crops up when we get into retirement. We spend an immense amount of time discussing the optimal techniques to draw down portfolios to avoid running out of money, yet in practice, almost no advisors implement these techniques precisely as researched. Miraculously, 99.9% of advisors have never had a single client run out of money. The reason is that when things are not going well, people change their behavior. We basically have no tools to model how human behavior will change. The idea of who has what kind of spending volatility tolerance and how to design a retirement portfolio for them represents a significant gap in our marketplace. No one seems to be experiencing catastrophic failures with the status quo, so it might not be entirely broken. However, I think there are some gaps. The fundamental issue that worries me is that our current system systematically underspends clients in retirement. Frankly, we have a pretty healthy industry bias toward this outcome because we get paid more when clients fail to spend their wealth down. I don\u2019t think any advisor intentionally prevents their clients from enjoying their money so that the advisor can bill more, but there is a subtle incentive that contributes to this issue. Straehl: Moving from flexibility into the personalization dimension, at a high level, what\u2019s the value of personalization versus off-the-shelf? Obviously, any financial plan is personal to some extent, but what are your thoughts on the value of personalization? Kitces: I get torn on some aspects of this topic. At the most basic level, every advisor has a personal relationship with their clients. It\u2019s already personalized. It already exists that way. So, all these discussions like, \u201cYour technology will help you have personalization at scale,\u201d are a nonstarter for me. Personalization is what this business is predicated on. The primary thing I try to do as a financial advisor is find ways to standardize and systematize, because otherwise, I overwhelm myself with the sheer level of personalization that\u2019s needed for each unique client with unique preferences, circumstances, and financial plans. What it essentially comes down to is that truly personalizing portfolios does not scale advisors; it descales them. It descales the client conversation. When I have a model portfolio and 11 meetings this week, I\u2019m going to have the same portfolio conversation 11 times. I know what\u2019s doing well, I know what\u2019s not doing well. I\u2019ve already done my research; I know what my talking points are going to be. I lose that efficiency when every client portfolio is \u201cpersonalized\u201d differently. So, I think there are real challenges. It\u2019s not insurmountable, but it means, ironically, I need a lot more tools and tech to expedite these client conversations. If I have to spend half an hour prepping before every meeting, it\u2019s going to significantly impact my efficiency. Straehl: Direct indexing in some ways is a technology-driven application of personalization. You have an article on this topic where you talk about personalized direct indexing. How do you think about personalization or customization in that context? Kitces: I\u2019m fascinated with direct indexing, but I also look at it through the different use cases. Starting with the simple use case: Direct indexing for the purpose of tax-loss harvesting. This works well from a scaling perspective because I can use the same models, positions, and offerings I was using in the past. My investment story doesn\u2019t change. I can talk about tax benefits, and I don\u2019t have to change my investment conversation. That seems pretty straightforward to me. But the other end of the spectrum is when I customize for a particular client circumstance. For example, if you work at Google and own a lot of Google stock, an advisor might build an S&P 500 portfolio for the client minus Google stock. Maybe you even exclude the tech sector because Google\u2019s a close enough proxy. The investment theory for doing this makes sense. But the caveat is that the portfolio begins to track the index less, which complicates things from an advisor\u2019s perspective. If advisors start doing this for all clients\u2014Googlers, Facebookers, Exxon workers, IBM\u2014it starts to get messier because each client\u2019s portfolio shows up a little differently. And now, the prep time for meetings starts to increase. The next layer of this, to me, is what I call \u201cpersonalized portfolios,\u201d which I frame as personalization not around client circumstances but around client preferences. So, call it \u201cESG or values-based investing,\u201d in that domain. If a client dislikes guns and tobacco stocks, they may request a portfolio without those. They may also want to see their capital supporting specific causes, allocating more toward those. This, to me, is an interesting double-edged sword from the advisor\u2019s perspective, needing to manage portfolio investment results and expectations. On one hand, this approach drastically descales me because every client now has a different portfolio built around their unique preferences. No two clients will have the same preferences because humans are wonderfully unique and varied. On the other hand, I think there are advisors who dive deeper and specialize in this approach, making it their niche so it remains systematized and consistent for all of their clients in that niche. They might say, \u201cWe help investors align their capital with causes and values important to them, expressed directly in their portfolio to build a successful retirement.\u201d Straehl: Your keynote highlighted the importance of creating meaningful experiences, using Build-A-Bear\u2019s model of customer engagement through hands-on participation. Do you believe that direct indexing could similarly foster deeper connections between investors and their portfolios? Kitces: I would say \u201cTBD,\u201d but I\u2019m not optimistic. There might be something to that. But I don\u2019t see many investors who buy things they don\u2019t believe in to begin with. Straehl: Closing the loop on the experiences question: What are sources of greater attachment through experiences? Kitces: When I think about what experiences look like, they\u2019re not about the money. They\u2019re about what the money represents. Let me give you an example. One area where advisors struggle is the first step of financial planning: gathering all the client\u2019s financial data so it can be plugged into the software for analysis. For many potential clients, this is where the process breaks down. Many people are financially disorganized; they literally can\u2019t fill out an advisor\u2019s data sheet. Then, we lack the necessary data, we bug them for it, they feel bad, and often we never get the data, causing the relationship to fall apart and the client to leave. So, when I consider what this looks like from an experiential standpoint, imagine sitting down with a new client. You say, \u201cLook, part of our financial planning process involves getting a full understanding of your financial picture to help you achieve your goals.\u201d What we\u2019ve found with many clients is that they\u2019re not sure where all their money is in the first place. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing, but it\u2019s true for many. It could be an old 401(k) plan you haven\u2019t thought about in a while, old bank accounts from childhood, or maybe a 529 plan opened in the state where a child was born but then moved away. Perhaps there\u2019s a box at home filled with envelopes that nobody looks at but holds important documents. So, part of what we do for our clients is help them get financially organized. For the next meeting, here\u2019s how it works: I\u2019ll ask you to bring in that box wherever it may be. We\u2019ll go through it together, bit by bit. I\u2019ll show you what documents to keep and what can be discarded so you don\u2019t have to deal with it in the future. We\u2019ll introduce a simple file folder system, color-coded with labels, that will help you stay organized moving forward. It\u2019s straightforward, effective, and you\u2019ll love it. It might take an hour or two, but you\u2019ll leave feeling more financially organized than ever before in your life. That\u2019s what I envision when I think about creating an experience. It\u2019s nothing elaborate, but it has an enormous impact. Straehl: We\u2019ll stop here, this was fantastic. All great insights, thank you for the time! Kitces: You\u2019re welcome. I hope it\u2019s food for thought."

        "author": "Denise Appleby",
        "body": "The IRS issued its highly anticipated final regulations for required minimum distributions on July 19, 2024. These regulations incorporate rules from both the Secure and Secure 2.0 acts. With these final regulations, the IRS answers many burning questions, including whether designated beneficiaries must take RMDs on an annual basis. Proposed regulations were also issued for the Secure 2.0 Act. Roth accounts: Owners of Roth accounts are not subject to RMDs. That has always been the case for Roth IRAs. For designated Roth accounts, or DRAs, which are Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b), and Roth 457(b) accounts, that rule became effective for years after 2023. As a result, the rules that apply to beneficiaries of Roth IRAs and DRAs for 2024 and after are the same as those that apply to beneficiaries who inherit traditional accounts from someone who died before they were supposed to start taking RMDs. These rules will be covered in an upcoming column. IRAs vs. Employer Plans: The explanations covered in this article apply to both IRAs and employer plans. If there is an exception where a rule applies to only one of the two, that exception will be stated. Employer plans: These are qualified plans, such as 401(k) and profit-sharing plans, 403(b) annuity contracts, 403(b) custodial accounts, 403(b) retirement income accounts, and eligible governmental 457(b) plans. IRA owners and employer-plan participants: For this article, both are collectively called \u201cparticipants.\u201d Certain definitions must be known when discussing the RMD rules, particularly for beneficiaries. Since I will use these definitions to share my findings from the final RMD regulations, I will include some key ones here. Applicable Age: The year for which your first RMD is due from your own (not inherited) retirement accounts. Required minimum distribution (RMD): The minimum amount to be withdrawn from an IRA or employer plan (retirement account) for a year. The RMD rules for participants differ from those that apply to beneficiaries. Designated beneficiary: Any individual designated as a beneficiary by the participant. The use of \u201cindividual\u201d is intentional here and excludes nonperson beneficiaries such as estates, charities, and corporations. Exceptions for see-through trusts: Certain trust beneficiaries are treated as designated beneficiaries if the trust is a \u201csee-through trust.\u201d Consult with your estate planning attorney regarding the pros and cons of designating a trust as your beneficiary and whether the trust is or should be a see-through trust. Eligible designated beneficiary: A designated beneficiary who, as of the date of the participant\u2019s death, is: Special rules apply for determining if a beneficiary is disabled or chronically ill. Your estate planning attorney can help to determine whether you meet the requirements. Required beginning date (RBD): April 1 of the year following the year you reach your applicable age. This April 1 date is the deadline by which your RMD for your applicable age\u2014your first RMD from your own retirement account\u2014must be taken. Uniform Lifetime Table: The life expectancy used to calculate RMDs for participants. This table assumes the participant\u2019s beneficiary is 10 years younger than the participant, regardless of the beneficiary\u2019s age. Joint and Last Survivor Table: This table is used to calculate RMDs for a participant whose spouse is their sole primary beneficiary and who is more than 10 years younger than the participant. Single Life Expectancy Table: This table determines the life expectancy that a beneficiary must use to calculate annual RMDs for their inherited accounts. Successor beneficiary: A beneficiary who inherits a retirement account from the primary (original) beneficiary. These are some of the definitions that form the foundation for applying the RMD regulations. You must take RMDs from your IRA or employer plan account (retirement account) beginning the year you reach your applicable age and continue every year for the rest of your life. The applicable age was increased from age 70\u00bd to age 72 for account owners who reached age 70\u00bd after 2019. This was a Secure Act change. The Secure 2.0 Act increased the applicable RMD age from 72 to 73 and 75 for those born after 1950. However, a technical error caused those born in 1959 to have applicable ages of 73 and 75. The final RMD regulations partially corrected that error by excluding 1959 from applicable ages 73 and 75, leaving the status as \u201creserved.\u201d The applicable ages, as provided in the final RMD regulations, are as follows: The final RMD regulations do not include an applicable age for those born in 1959. However, under the proposed regulations for Secure 2.0, the applicable age for a participant born in 1959 would be 73. Your RMD must be taken by Dec. 31 of the year it is due. However, an exception applies to your RMD for the year you reach your applicable age. Under that exception, your RMD can be taken as late as April 1 of the following year\u2014your required beginning date, or RBD. Please note: A plan can allow qualifying participants to defer their applicable age past the ages above until retirement. For some employer plans, RMDs can also start earlier than the ages above. Check with your employer to confirm your applicable age. Whether the annual RMD requirement for certain 10-year beneficiaries would stay is one of the most anticipated explanations for the final RMD regulations. Ten-year beneficiaries must fully distribute their inherited accounts no later than the 10th year after inheriting. A 10-year beneficiary who is subject to annual RMDs is one who inherited a retirement account after 2019 and is either of the following: These regulations confirm that the annual RMD requirement applies to these beneficiaries. Further, the 10-year deadline is not extended. Therefore, a 10-year beneficiary who inherited a retirement account in 2020, for instance, must ensure that the account is fully distributed no later than 2030, whether or not they took RMDs for the waived years. For additional explanations of this rule, see IRS Extends Waiver of Excise Tax for Inherited IRAs, but Not RMDs. If a participant dies on or after their RBD, their beneficiary is subject to the \u201cat least as rapidly,\u201d or ALAR, rule. Under the ALAR rule, beneficiaries must continue taking annual RMDs. These annual RMDs for beneficiaries would be calculated using the Single Life Expectancy Table, not the Uniform Lifetime or Joint Life Expectancy tables the participant would have used. However, the language in the Secure Act led many to believe that beneficiaries subject to the 10-year rule would not be subject to the ALAR rule. The proposed RMD regulations clarified that all beneficiaries, including 10-year beneficiaries, are subject to the ALAR rule. Therefore, if the account owner dies on or after their RBD, their designated beneficiary must take annual RMDs over their single life expectancy beginning the year following the participant\u2019s death and continuing for every year after up to the 10th year when the account must be fully distributed. In response to backlash about the confusing language in the Secure Act, the IRS waived the excise tax that would have otherwise applied to any of these 10-year beneficiaries who did not take RMD for 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 If you are a 10-year beneficiary, you must take your 2025 RMD in 2025. If you want to take any RMDs you did not take before 2025, you may do so, but that is optional. When deciding, consider that the 10 years are not extended and consult your tax advisor regarding how to proceed for tax-efficiency purposes. Under the ALAR rule, eligible designated beneficiaries must take annual RMDs over the longer of the beneficiary\u2019s single life expectancy or the remaining single life expectancy of the decedent. However, the proposed regulations penalized beneficiaries older than the decedent by requiring such a beneficiary to fully distribute the account when the beneficiary\u2019s life expectancy ends. The final regulations removed this requirement, which means that a beneficiary who is older than the participant may take distributions over the full life expectancy of the participant. For example, John died in 2020 at age 75, after his RBD. Therefore, the ALAR rule applies to his beneficiary. John\u2019s beneficiary is his 80-year-old sister, Kim. Kim is an eligible designated beneficiary because she is \u201cnot more than 10 years younger\u201d than John. Therefore, she must take distribution over her single life expectancy or John\u2019s single life expectancy, whichever is longer. In this case, John\u2019s life expectancy is longer. The following is a comparison of John\u2019s and Kim\u2019s life expectancies. In this example, the proposed regulations required Kim to fully distribute the account no later than 2031, when she would be 91, and her life expectancy would be less than one. But, under the final RMD regulations, Kim can now extend her inherited account to 2034 when John\u2019s life expectancy ends. For how life expectancy is determined, see Avoid RMD Shortfalls With These 5 Top Rules on Life Expectancy. The final regulations are 260 pages long and cover other pertinent information about the RMD rules for account owners and beneficiaries. This article only scratches the surface. As with most regulations, the IRS is anticipated to provide further clarifications when necessary. I will provide additional explanations over the coming weeks. In the meantime, please consult with your advisor regarding your RMD obligations and options for your own retirement accounts and any that you inherit. Denise Appleby will be speaking about \u201cMaximizing the Benefit of Inherited Retirement Assets\u201d at the WealthCounsel 2024 Symposium in Las Vegas, Sept. 24\u201326, 2024."

Here are a few excerpts from Duhigg\u2019s conversation with Morningstar\u2019s Christine Benz and Amy Arnott. Benz: In the book, you talk about three conversation types: the conversation about what\u2019s this really about, how do we feel, and who are we. How do you think financial advisors could use the three conversation types to develop better relationships with their clients? Duhigg: I think there\u2019s a huge number of opportunities to use this. There are a couple of stories in the book. There\u2019s a story about the CIA officer who is trying to recruit an overseas agent, and he is just terrible. He is really bad at recruiting. This is his first job, and he can\u2019t figure it out. And there is this story about a doctor, a surgeon who kept on telling his patients, I don\u2019t think you need surgery. And his patients would just insist on the surgery. And I think that\u2019s similar to what financial consultants and financial advisors face, which is oftentimes you have a client who comes in and you give them great advice. And it\u2019s just as if they cannot hear your advice. Or it seems like they\u2019re distracted or you\u2019re not having the conversation with them that it seems like they want. And I think what often happens in those situations is that we go in assuming that they want a practical conversation. They came to me for advice. I\u2019m going to give them advice on whether to get the surgery or not. I\u2019m going to give them advice on what to do for retirement, how to structure their portfolio. And they\u2019re actually saying I want advice, but actually if we ask a couple of questions, what we discover pretty quickly is they need to have an emotional conversation first. Because before they can have that practical conversation, before they can hear that advice, they need us to acknowledge their feelings and they need to voice their feelings: \u201cI\u2019m feeling anxious because retirement is coming up, and I\u2019m not certain that I\u2019ve saved enough, and I don\u2019t know what my life is going to be like, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to provide for my kids as they get older and help them buy a house.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m feeling chagrined because it\u2019s embarrassing\u2014we\u2019re supposed to know about money, and the fact that I don\u2019t know some basic stuff and I\u2019m coming to you and asking you for advice. I want to prove to you first that I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m smart. And we\u2019ve got to get that off the table before I can hear your advice.\u201d The more that we have the ability to try and figure out what kind of conversation this person wants to have, the better we can serve them and the better we can get to the stuff that\u2019s really important. The surgeon that I mentioned, what he found is that rather than giving people advice as soon as they came into his office, if he started the conversation by saying\u2014he is a cancer surgeon, he works on prostate cancers\u2014if he started the conversation by saying his first question was, tell me what this cancer diagnosis means to you? Oftentimes people would open up, and they would start talking about things like watching their parents get sick, or being concerned about the financial impacts of getting sick, or just concerned about the state of the world. What kind of world are we leaving for our children with climate change and everything? They would talk for 10 minutes without mentioning their cancer or medical questions or concerns about pain or questions about treatments because they wanted to first have this emotional conversation. And when he matched them, when he would talk about his own father getting sick and what that meant for him and his family, then he was able to say, can we talk about some treatments that I might suggest? And the other person was ready to listen to them. For financial advisors, I think one of the best things we can do is start that conversation by inviting folks to answer the broadest question possible, which is when you came in today, what does this meeting mean to you? What are you hoping to walk away with? What is it that\u2019s keeping you up at night that I can help you with? Because oftentimes the answers are going to surprise us. Arnott: You also talk about the idea of adding new items to the table as a way of testing out how the other person might like the conversation to unfold. Can you give us an example of how that might work? Duhigg: What often happens, particularly at the beginning of a conversation, is something that\u2019s known as a quiet negotiation. And a quiet negotiation is interesting because the goal of a quiet negotiation is not to win the negotiation. The goal of a quiet negotiation is to figure out what the other person wants. And sometimes they don\u2019t know what they want, or they don\u2019t know how to elucidate what they want. And the way that we get to that is by running little experiments. So, take the financial advisor meeting. You come in and you say, \u201cI\u2019m here to talk about my retirement. But it just doesn\u2019t seem like the conversation just isn\u2019t moving forward. I bring something up, and you don\u2019t seem to really click with it.\u201d I might want to add something to the table and say, \u201cLook, in addition to retirement, can I just ask you what kind of legacy you want to leave for your kids, when you think about how you want to help them as they get older and maybe inheritance?\u201d OK, I\u2019m going to add that to the table. I\u2019m going to see if that resonates with you because it might set off something where suddenly I see the big issue here is that you\u2019re worried that your retirement is going to drain the accounts and you won\u2019t have anything to leave for your kids and leaving something for your kids is really important. Or I might ask you, \u201cHow do you think about philanthropy? Is it important to you? Is it something that you\u2019ve benefited from? Is it an important part of how you see your place in the world?\u201d And again, what I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m adding items to the table and I\u2019m seeing if they spark anything within you. Someone might very well say, \u201cI give plenty of money to philanthropy. I don\u2019t really care about it that much. It\u2019s not something I need to think about.\u201d OK, now I know. Now I know that is not part of the set of issues that you\u2019re thinking about. But when I add items to the table in a way that is open-ended, that says tell me what your thoughts are about X. Tell me what this diagnosis means to you. Tell me about how you think of yourself as a financial creature. What I\u2019m really doing is saying, tell me what you want from this conversation. And that\u2019s really powerful. Arnott: It seems like it might be hard for people to do that, especially if it\u2019s someone like a doctor or a financial advisor who is an expert and probably has ideas in mind for what that person needs in their particular situation. But it sounds like you need to take a step back before presenting a solution based on your knowledge, just making sure you understand what the other person is really looking for from the conversation. Duhigg: That\u2019s exactly right. And I think that\u2019s what the best advisors do. The best advisors aren\u2019t the best advisors because their advice is so good. Their advice is good. But advice is something you can get from anyone. The best advisors are so successful because the people that they\u2019re talking to feel listened to. They believe that their advisor understands them. In part, they feel like the advisor is customizing their answers to their unique problems, as opposed to just trying to give them the same advice that they give to everyone. Even if it ends up being the same advice you give to everyone, it feels personalized because I feel like you\u2019ve listened to me."

        "body": "There\u2019s long been talk of a looming retirement crisis in the US. However, our research suggests a more nuanced reality. In our new report, my colleague Jack VanDerhei and I analyzed the likelihood that today\u2019s US workers will have adequate financial resources in retirement using the new Morningstar Model of US Retirement Outcomes. This new model aims to provide a comprehensive and realistic assessment of the retirement landscape. It features a sophisticated simulation framework, incorporating realistic investor behavior in the simulation. For example, savings rates are not static in our analysis. Instead, they vary based on various investor factors and plan features, reflecting the reality that investors do not maintain the same savings rate over the course of a lifetime of contributing to their retirement accounts. We also reflect key postretirement considerations such as longevity risk, investment risk, and catastrophic healthcare costs into the analysis, simulating health states and retirement expenses, including those associated with long-term services and supports. The model integrates detailed household financial data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances into the analysis. Our most salient finding is that participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans significantly improved projected retirement outcomes. Specifically, we found that 57% of people not participating in a defined-contribution plan in the future may run short of money, compared with only 21% for those with 20 or more years of future participation in a defined-contribution plan. (Although, of course, people who contribute to a plan can still undermine their retirement by taking preretirement withdrawals or cashing out upon job termination.) Results of this analysis are displayed below. Note that we are focusing on the results corresponding to a retirement-funding ratio less than 1. A ratio less than 1 indicates that projected income across all retirement years (the numerator of the ratio calculation) fell short of the projected expenses across all retirement years (the denominator in the ratio calculation)\u2014that is, the lower the ratio, the less prepared the individual is for retirement. Note that we also incorporate bequests (that is, any leftover assets at the time of death) in the numerator of the retirement-funding ratio calculation, which is why ratios can be greater than 1. Plan participation matters because Americans who participate in a defined-contribution plan are much more likely to save for retirement than workers who do not participate. For example, using the 2022 SCF, we noted that the average account balance (including retirement and nonretirement accounts, which refer to accounts where contributions are made on a post-tax basis) for Americans currently saving in a defined-contribution plan was about 4 times higher than for those who were not saving into a defined-contribution plan. We also analyzed retirement funding ratios across income quartiles. We found that there is considerable dispersion in retirement outcomes, with lower-income workers much more likely to experience shortfalls. Namely, almost 75% of households in the second-lowest income quartile with 0 years of future participation in a defined-contribution plan were projected to run short of money in retirement. However, retirement deficits for this income quartile were notably lower in cases in which household members were simulated to participate in a defined-contribution plan for 10 or more years. For example, focusing on the second income quartile, only about 28% of the households experienced retirement shortfalls when participating in a defined-contribution plan for 20 or more years. This finding reinforces the point that policymakers and plan sponsors should focus on improving defined-contribution plan access and plan participation. Long-term services and supports expenses are a big reason why lower-income households are so much more likely to experience retirement shortfalls. While we do project LTSS needs for higher-income households, there is not a significant impact on retirement adequacy because these households typically have sufficient assets to cover the costs. Lower-income households, however, do not have extra savings to cover health shocks, meaning that one or two years of LTSS can often deplete their savings. We also analyzed retirement outcomes from a generational and race and ethnicity perspective. On the former, we found that baby boomers and Generation Xers are more at risk of retirement insecurity than later generations. And on the latter, we noted that Hispanic and Black Americans are much more likely to experience retirement shortfalls. The report underscores that participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans significantly enhances retirement outcomes. Workers without access to these plans face a higher risk of financial shortfalls in retirement. The Morningstar Model of US Retirement Outcomes will serve as a baseline for future research. In particular, we plan on assessing the impact of legislative and regulatory proposals (such as changes to the Social Security regime) on retirement outcomes. We also plan on studying the effects of plan design modifications in order to help policymakers and employers make informed decisions to enhance retirement outcomes. "

        "published": "Jul 26, 2024",

        "author": "Christine Benz",
        "body": "In a recent article, I examined the statistics on the likelihood that a 65-year-old in the US would end up needing long-term care. The data reveal a head-scratching gap: While 22% of the population of people 65 and over will need long-term care for more than five years, just 4% of the population over age 65 is expected to need paid long-term care for longer than five years. Unpaid caregiving, often delivered by family members, especially adult children, and close friends, explains the difference. Such care is often provided to save older adults from exhausting their resources to pay for care and/or needing to receive care through Medicaid funding. But delivering unpaid care also has the potential to exact a steep toll on the individuals providing it: on their careers and own finances, as well as their physical and emotional health. It can also create strife within families, as the burden of care inevitably falls on a single sibling or two. For those reasons, it\u2019s important to think through the implications of relying on unpaid long-term care. And if you think you might need to rely on friends and family for caregiving, it\u2019s helpful to think through logistics and create a formal plan to help head off some of the challenges that informal caregivers may confront. More than two thirds of older adults who need long-term care receive it from family and friends, and the estimated economic value of that care amounted to roughly $600 billion in 2021, according to a report from AARP. For some context around those very large numbers, Americans paid $433 billion out of pocket for all other healthcare in 2021 and $245 million out of pocket for long-term care (to paid caregivers and nursing homes, for example). The economic value of unpaid long-term care is also growing by leaps and bounds as the population ages, longevity boosts the incidence of cognitive decline, and the cost of paid care escalates. AARP\u2019s estimate of the value of unpaid care was $354 billion in 2006. The fact that so many people are providing care without remuneration has implications on multiple fronts, and those effects are often magnified for lower-income workers, Black and Hispanic people, women, and the growing ranks of \u201csandwich generation\u201d caregivers\u2014people who are simultaneously providing unpaid care to an older adult while also caring for children and grandchildren. Careers: More than 60% of unpaid caregivers are employed on a part-time or full-time basis, and more than half of them are paid on an hourly basis. In a 2019 survey, 19% of working caregivers said they had quit a job in order to cover care for a family member. Meanwhile, 70% of working caregivers said that they have had to leave work early or decline promotions so that they could provide care. No doubt because of these work disruptions, unpaid caregivers had higher levels of debt and lower savings than people without caregiving responsibilities, according to a report from TIAA Institute. Out-of-Pocket Costs: In addition to the career-related toll of unpaid caregiving, unpaid caregivers also frequently reported out-of-pocket expenses associated with their caregiving responsibilities\u2014to help with housing and healthcare costs, for example. Those costs average more than $7,000 a year per unpaid caregiver, according to the TIAA Institute report. Physical and Emotional Health: Research from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that those who provided substantial healthcare assistance, compared with those who provided none, were more likely to report caregiving-related emotional difficulty (34% versus 15%) and physical difficulty (22% versus 6%). Given all of those challenges for informal caregivers, the question is how to protect your loved ones from incurring them. Here are the key steps to take: Assess resources and develop a plan for paying for care. The key first step in ensuring that you don\u2019t burden loved ones with your care is to determine how you might cover the cost of care if it should arise. The key options are to purchase pure long-term-care insurance or a hybrid product, self-fund long-term-care expenses and factor that into your retirement-spending plan, or rely on government resources. (I\u2019ll write more about each of these options in future articles.) If it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll need to rely on Medicaid for all or part of your care, plan to visit a Medicaid-planning attorney early to learn the rules in your state. Like any legal advice, that can be costly, but it can be money well spent if it helps ensure that you qualify for Medicaid-provided care when you need it. Most communities have groups that provide free legal aid, and most communities also have eldercare agencies that can provide assistance. However, there are often long waiting lists for help, accentuating the importance of information-gathering before you\u2019re in a crunch. Once you\u2019ve determined your most likely avenue to pay for your care, communicate the details of that plan with your loved ones. Let them know if you have long-term-care insurance, of course, or if you\u2019d like them to sell your home or use specific assets to pay for your care. Discuss the potential for long-term-care needs long in advance of a care need. Financial planner and medical doctor Carolyn McClanahan says that it\u2019s wise to start discussing long-term care\u2014and not just the financial aspect\u2014when you\u2019re in your 50s and 60s. She recommends first asking where you\u2019ll live if a long-term-care need arises. If your current home is the answer, assess whether it\u2019s aging-friendly or needs modifications. Next assess the extent to which family will participate in your care, including providing or coordinating care, managing home upkeep, managing finances, and participating in healthcare decisions. And if you are opposed to the idea of your loved ones providing care for you, be sure to communicate that to them, too. McClanahan advises her clients to document in writing the results of these conversations. She says that this is also the time to discuss with your family how care will be paid for. If there is a chance that your assets or insurance won\u2019t cover your care, make sure your family understands the resources available in their state and how to qualify so that they\u2019re not scrambling when a care need arises. I\u2019ll chime in here and say that if your plan is to age in place, it\u2019s crucial to consider the full gamut of care that you might need and factor in the implications for family and friends. My parents had in-home care and lived in an aging-friendly home; they had a house cleaner and someone to do lawn maintenance. But I was nonetheless there constantly: to manage the caregivers and help with time off, to grocery shop and pay bills, and to manage household maintenance. I loved my parents, lived close by, and had an exceptionally generous employer (thanks, Morningstar!). But it was a stressful time for all of us. If you don\u2019t have an extremely committed adult child or other loved one nearby, think twice about aging in place. Once a care need becomes evident, create detailed family agreements. If a family member or other loved one is providing care on an ongoing basis, McClanahan recommends consulting with a Medicaid-planning attorney early in the process to determine the next steps. While some older adults may pay their children or other loved ones for care, out of pocket and without any documentation, that can be a mistake, especially if Medicaid may need to cover care at some point. That\u2019s why it\u2019s often advisable to formalize the caregiving arrangement with what\u2019s called a personal care agreement. That\u2019s a contract that stipulates in writing the compensation that will be provided for such care, the type of services that will be provided, and the expected duration of the care, among other factors. Having such a document helps ensure that you\u2019re paying payroll taxes for the caregiver and that the caregiver\u2019s compensation is not a gift, an important factor in case you eventually need to qualify for Medicaid-provided care. In addition to creating a personal care agreement, McClanahan says a Medicaid-planning attorney should educate the family on the other documentation they might need to qualify for Medicaid, such as a ledger of the hours and type of care the family caregiver has provided. In addition to the personal care agreement, which is mainly for paid caregiving arrangements, McClanahan also creates family agreements for unpaid caregiving and other responsibilities. Such agreements help ensure that both parties understand and are on board with the arrangements."

        "body": "Editor\u2019s note: This article originally ran on Feb. 28, 2017. It\u2019s a rare newbie investor who has the financial wherewithal\u2014and foresight\u2014to hit the ground running on a retirement savings plan, making the maximum allowable IRA and 401(k) contributions at the same time she\u2019s getting her career off the ground. Instead, most investors tiptoe into retirement savings. They might start with token investments in their 401(k) plans (or get automatically enrolled in them, if they\u2019re not paying attention). Then, as their finances allow or if they\u2019re dissatisfied with their 401(k)s, they \u201cgraduate\u201d into other investment vehicles for their retirement nest eggs, such as IRAs and taxable accounts. One question investors often ask is, if they have a fixed sum of money to invest every month or every year, how should they deploy that cash for their retirement savings? Which receptacle gives them the biggest bang for their buck? As with many financial-planning questions, there are no one-size-fits-all answers: Variations in investors\u2019 company retirement plans, tax situations, and time horizons mean that a retirement savings hierarchy that makes sense for one may not add up for another. That said, the following framework for retirement savings will be a good starting point for many investors. (Note that this hierarchy does not factor in nonretirement financial goals, such as amassing an emergency fund, saving for college, or investing for short- and intermediate-term financials.) Stop 1: Invest enough in a 401(k)/other company retirement plan to earn matching contributions. Why prioritize it: To take advantage of free money. Deprioritize if: Your 401(k) offers no matching contributions. In that case, proceed directly to Stop 2. Diversification has been called the only free lunch in investing. But there's another: 401(k) matching contributions. Even if a company's match is lackluster\u2014say, $0.25 on every dollar invested\u2014it's going to be difficult to outearn that rate of return by investing outside of the 401(k) (or 403(b) or 457 plan). And remember: Those matching contributions are in addition to any investment earnings. Thus, the first stop for individuals just starting out is to contribute at least enough to earn the full match. If the company provides a match of $0.50 for every dollar invested, up to 6% of pay, the employee should target a 401(k) contribution of at least 6%, too. Stop 2: Invest in an IRA. Why prioritize it: Low costs, flexibility, and the ability to contribute to a Roth. Deprioritize if: Your company retirement plan features all the bells and whistles, including ultralow costs and a Roth option. Alternatively, if you need the legal protections of a 401(k). In any of those instances, contribute the maximum to the 401(k) before funding an IRA. It doesn\u2019t get much more simple than making contributions to a 401(k) plan: The money comes out of the investor\u2019s paycheck, like it or not. Moreover, IRAs enjoy no special tax advantages over 401(k)s. So, why bother with an IRA? Why not fill up that 401(k) to the max, assuming you can spare the $23,000 maximum allowable contribution ($30,500 for savers older than 50)? Costs are one of the key reasons: Many 401(k) plans feature a layer of administrative fees, whereas investors buying into an IRA can invest without that layer. (Investors with very small IRAs may, however, be on the hook for account-maintenance fees.) And while 401(k) investors are typically wedded to a specific menu of investment choices, some of which may be high-cost, IRA investors are free to invest in a broad gamut of securities, including ultralow-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds. Additionally, some individuals simply cannot contribute to a 401(k) because their employers don't offer one. Finally, not all 401(k) plans offer a Roth option, whereas all IRA investors have the option to contribute to a Roth. (High earners will need to go in through the \u201cbackdoor,\u201d as outlined here.) Roth IRA investors also readily have access to their contributions without any strictures. Of course\u2014and here\u2019s one of the big exceptions to the hierarchy\u2014some 401(k) plans are rock-solid, featuring no layer of administrative expenses, extra-low-cost investment options, and a full range of features, including the ability to make Roth contributions. If your 401(k) plan ticks all of those boxes, you can go ahead and make a full 401(k) contribution before moving to an IRA. Stop 2a: Invest in a spousal IRA. Why prioritize it: Amass retirement savings for a nonearning spouse. Deprioritize if: The 401(k) of the spouse with earnings is rock-solid; in that case, fully funding that 401(k) plan could reasonably come before funding IRAs for either spouse. For married couples with a nonearning spouse, funding a spousal IRA should come next in the hierarchy. Assuming the earning spouse has enough income to cover both her contribution and that of her spouse, the nonearning spouse can accumulate retirement savings in his name and also help build up the couple's joint retirement nest egg. Because nonearning spouses don't have the opportunity to contribute to company retirement-savings vehicles such as 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and 457 plans, the spousal IRA is the only game in town. Stop 3: Invest in your company retirement plan up to the limit. Why prioritize it: The ability to enjoy tax-free contributions and tax-deferred compounding (traditional), or tax-free compounding and withdrawals (Roth). Deprioritize if: You have plenty of assets in accounts that will be taxed upon withdrawal and you\u2019re close to retirement. If that\u2019s the case, you may want to prioritize saving in a taxable (nonretirement) account instead of maxing out the company retirement plan. Ditto, if there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll need the money before retirement. For higher-income investors who have significant assets to invest toward their retirement savings, taking advantage of all tax-sheltered retirement-savings options should precede investing in nonretirement accounts. And that\u2019s true even if the 401(k), 403(b), or 457 plan isn\u2019t best of breed. Investors in traditional 401(k)s contribute pretax dollars and enjoy tax-deferred compounding; further, making pretax contributions reduces adjusted gross income, thereby increasing eligibility for valuable credits and deductions. Investors in Roth 401(k)s, meanwhile, enjoy tax-free compounding and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Those tax benefits are the key reason that investing in a 401(k)\u2014even one that\u2019s subpar\u2014trumps investing in a taxable account. However, it's worth noting that the benefits of investing in a 401(k) are magnified over longer time horizons; investors who are close to retirement will benefit less from the tax deferral of a traditional 401(k) simply because the money will have less time to compound in the account. Moreover, such investors may value tax diversification in retirement. By investing in a taxable account, they'll be able to avoid required minimum distributions and pay capital gains taxes\u2014rather than ordinary income taxes\u2014when they eventually withdraw the money. If that's the case, they may want to prioritize investing in a taxable (nonretirement) account over making additional 401(k) contributions as they get close to retirement. Stop 4: Make health savings account contributions up to the limit. Why prioritize it: Health savings accounts offer a tax break every step of the way: pretax contributions go in, funds can be invested and grow inside the account with any tax benefits, and qualified withdrawals for healthcare outlays are also tax-free. Deprioritize if: You can\u2019t contribute; you must be covered by a high-deductible health plan to contribute to an HSA. Health savings accounts aren\u2019t technically retirement savings vehicles. Nonetheless, they can be treated as such if you invest your HSA assets and let the money compound until retirement. In retirement (or sooner), qualified withdrawals are tax-free. In a worst-case scenario where you save more in an HSA than you have in healthcare expenses, withdrawals after age 65 receive the same tax treatment that withdrawals from traditional IRAs or 401(k)s do. Stop 5: Make aftertax 401(k) contributions to the limit. Why prioritize it: The ability to enhance a portfolio\u2019s share of Roth assets, eventually\u2014provided the 401(k) plan allows for the contribution of aftertax dollars. Deprioritize if: The 401(k) is especially poor or especially good, as outlined at the bottom of this article. Investors who have already made the maximum 401(k) contribution of $23,000 ($30,500 if older than 50) can contribute at an even higher level\u2014up to $69,000 in total contributions in 2024\u2014provided their plans allow for contributions of aftertax 401(k) dollars. Those aftertax 401(k) contributions can be converted to Roth inside the plan, assuming the plan allows for it, or once the investor has retired, left the company, or is taking in-service distributions from their plans. Such contributions will tend to be less attractive for investors who have particularly poor or costly 401(k) plans; the costs of investing in a very poor plan have the potential to erode the eventual tax savings associated with having more Roth assets. Stop 6: Invest in a taxable account. Why prioritize it: You\u2019re aiming for tax diversification in retirement and already have a sizable share of your assets in tax-deferred and Roth accounts. Ditto if there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll need to take out your money before retirement or you expect to be in the 0% tax bracket for capital gains when you withdraw your money. Deprioritize if: You haven\u2019t yet taken advantage of tax-advantaged accounts that are available to you and you have a long time horizon for your money. Investing inside of a taxable (nonretirement) account offers the most possible flexibility, albeit without the tax breaks that accompany the aforementioned investment wrappers. Not only can you invest in nearly anything inside of a taxable account, but there are no withdrawal requirements either. You can pull the money out whenever you need it, but you can also let it build for as long as you want; any taxable assets that your heirs inherit from you will receive a step-up in basis, too. And while you\u2019ll need to invest aftertax dollars in the account, you\u2019ll owe capital gains taxes (lower than ordinary income taxes) when you sell. This article hails some of the important benefits that come along with taxable accounts. As attractive as all of that flexibility is, the tax benefits conferred by IRAs and company retirement plans usually make up for any extra costs or other drawbacks associated with those plans, especially for investors with longer time horizons."

        "body": "Christine Benz: Hi, I\u2019m Christine Benz from Morningstar. The penalties for missing required minimum distributions from tax-deferred accounts recently changed. Joining me to discuss what you need to know about these penalties and how to avoid them is tax and IRA expert Ed Slott. He is the author of a new book called The Retirement Savings Time Bomb Ticks Louder. Ed, thank you so much for being here. Slott: Great to be back here. Thanks. Benz: It\u2019s great to have you here in person. Before we get into some of these penalties and the changes that have recently come to penalties, let\u2019s talk about the accounts that are subject to required minimum distributions and the ones that aren\u2019t. Slott: Well, all IRAs are, traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs, never. Roth 401(k)s, never. 401(k)s are, but there are ways around that. If you\u2019re still working for a company, they can be delayed till retirement. But other than that, IRAs are the main focus of the RMDs. Benz: Let\u2019s talk about how the penalties have changed. It used to be that if you missed your required minimum distribution, you\u2019d have to pay, what, 50%? Slott: Fifty percent. It was draconian. It was unbelievable. It was so high that I think even the IRS felt bad about it. I only saw one case ever where they assessed it, and it was only because the person had a representative or a tax advisor that didn\u2019t understand it and asked IRS to assess the penalty because they thought they would give them some other benefits. So, IRS said, \u201cOK, if you insist.\u201d But other than that, they rarely assessed it, because even they had to think losing half a year, you know, it\u2019s crazy. Benz: Right. Slott: The penalty was 50% of the amount you should have taken out but didn\u2019t. And remember who this affected; it affects beneficiaries, too, but generally older, seniors getting into a new phase of life. They\u2019ve been putting money in and putting money in, now the rules are so confusing. So, if they missed it and made up the shortfall, IRS\u2014they have to file a Form 5329\u2014would waive the penalty in almost every case. Now, Secure 2.0 lowered that penalty down. I know, it\u2019s still a large penalty, \u201cOh, only 25%,\u201d but even 10% if you make up the missed distribution within two years. But there\u2019s still a way where IRS can still go back to the other system and waive the whole penalty if you make up the back distributions and you show a reason. You have to file Form 5329 and you attach it to your return. You could actually file it as a separate return, but most people would attach it to their return. And you have to give a little explanation. You don\u2019t have to overdo it. Just, you know, a death in the family, there was an illness, I was confused about the rules, bad advice from my advisor. In fact, there was one case recently that an advisor took over a new account, and they updated the account with the new financial company, and they put the person\u2019s date of birth as Jan. 1, whenever they took it, 2000, when the person was born in 1939. And it was off by 60 years of life expectancy. The proposed penalty was over $100,000. So, mistakes happen, and IRS realizes that. You just have to say, I took the back distributions, and they will waive it. IRS has already said, \u201cWe\u2019ll still stick to that deal.\u201d We don\u2019t know about the lower 10% penalty, because they were very generous and liberal with the 50%, which is almost understandable. But I wonder if they\u2019re going to be as nice and liberal when the penalty is only 10%. I\u2019d rather pay 50% on nothing than 10% on something. Benz: Right. Slott: But then there was another snag that came out, Secure 2.0. Because the problem was, and I guess Congress and IRS realized this, people weren\u2019t filing Form 5329. So, there was no statute of limitations. And it happens. I remember having a client years ago, who was 80 years old, came in new. I just met him. I said, where are your RMDs? \u201cDo I have to start?\u201d And it was 10 years already, and they just didn\u2019t know. So, IRS said, \u201cWell, if you file Form 5329 to get us to waive the penalty and take the back distributions, we can waive the penalty.\u201d But if you don\u2019t file Form 5329, even though you file your personal return, the statute never begins to run. So, they fixed that. They said, all right, you know, that\u2019s a problem. People wouldn\u2019t know they missed an RMD, so they wouldn\u2019t know to file Form 5329. The statute could go back indefinitely. And by the way, this only applies, this new statute, for three years and six years, two different versions, for 2022 and later. So, the 50% penalty is still out there. So, what happens is now they have these two versions. They say you can get a three-year statute of limitations, which means they can only go back three years from the date you file your personal tax return. It won\u2019t hinge on the 5329 anymore. But you have to make up the distributions, but you also would have to attach an explanation of how you calculated a list of all your IRAs, the balance, your age\u2014nobody\u2019s doing that that I know of. So, if you don\u2019t do that, it falls to the six-year statute. So now, you\u2019d have to make up six back years. Nobody has done that yet because we\u2019re not six years out from when Secure 2.0 started. But it created this mess of confusion. So, I would just tell people to be really diligent about making the right calculation. But you could see how people make mistakes. They have IRAs all over the place. In fact, I saw you on a program, I was telling you earlier, where you said this may be one of the reasons to consolidate your IRAs, so you don\u2019t have them out there. You go to the bank or the broker, and they will do the calculation for you, but they don\u2019t know what you have at the other place, at this place. They don\u2019t know the whole story. So, really, it\u2019s best to consolidate to make it easier for yourself. It makes it a little more complicated if you have a 401(k) subject to RMDs, that has to come from the 401(k). IRAs have a special rule where you can take your RMD based on the value of all your IRAs, including SEP and simple IRAs, figure it on that, but you can take the RMD from any one or combination of them, but you have to know what the whole RMD is. This is very complicated for seniors. Now that the age is raised to 73, people are older who are entering this cycle, so you can see it\u2019s a recipe for disaster. Benz: Definitely. Consolidation seems like a great point. Any other tips for people who want to be sure that they do not miss their RMD? Slott: Well, you would take an inventory of all your accounts and maybe get some professional guidance on that. But you have to tell them, you can\u2019t forget about certain accounts that are out in left field somewhere you forgot about, and that\u2019s where consolidation comes in. Because right now, you don\u2019t need a lot of IRAs. People had them years ago because they felt they got certain investments in this one and a toaster in that one or whatever they got. Now you can diversify all in one IRA, which I think was your point on the program you were on, and this way makes it a lot easier if you know you only had to calculate your IRA RMD on one IRA and have somebody check the calculation. And then, if you really want to make extra double belt-and-suspenders sure, file the 5329 anyway with an attachment showing the IRS how you made the calculation, at least that would lock in the three-year statute. Benz: Well, Ed, helpful advice as always. Thank you so much for being here. Slott: Thanks. Benz: Thanks for watching. I\u2019m Christine Benz from Morningstar.

        "body": "Conventional wisdom holds that renewable energy stocks are young, fast-growing companies with volatile share prices, lofty valuations, and dividend payouts that are skimpy at best. However, there are well-established companies with strong profiles that offer high dividend yields and trade at attractive prices in this space. For this article, we looked at the Morningstar Global Markets Renewable Energy Index, which includes companies that derive at least 5% of revenues from renewable energy or green transportation, as well as those that use renewable energy for at least 25% of their energy requirements, as measured by the Sustainalytics Sustainable Activities Involvement Metrics. We screened for stocks covered by Morningstar analysts and then sorted them by forward dividend yield to find the five with the highest payouts. All these stocks are undervalued, carrying Morningstar Ratings of 4 or 5 stars. Here\u2019s a closer look at the five stocks: With a forward dividend yield of 18.23%, this Belgian telecom operator tops our list. Proximus\u2019 stock is down 1.53% this year. Over the last 12 months, it is up 21.14%. Analyst Javier Correonero writes, \u201cWe are pleased with Proximus\u2019 performance on the revenue front, as it can pass price increases to customers with little impact on churn rates.\u201d European telecom giant Vodafone has the second-highest forward dividend yield in the index, at 10.76%. Vodafone\u2019s stock is up 9.47% in the year to date and 11.16% in the last 12 months. Vodafone is currently trading at 0.71 GBP per share. Correonero writes, \u201cWe are maintaining our GBP 1.25 fair value estimate and see the shares as undervalued, although we do not see any near-term catalyst in place ... However, it is worth noting that this high dividend yield will not last forever.\u201d He expects Vodafone to halve its dividend in fiscal 2025 to \u201ca maintainable level.\u201d Engie is a global energy firm that operates Europe\u2019s largest gas pipeline network in France and a global fleet of conventional and renewable power plants. The stock yields 10.1%. The shares are down 2.06% in the year to date but up 4.50% over the last 12 months. Analyst Tancrede Fulop calls the shares, currently at EUR 14.16, undervalued. He adds: \u201cRecord profits posted in 2022 and 2023 drove a surge in the dividend. In the future, the dividend will decrease in the wake of the profits normalization, although we expect Engie to apply the high end of the payout ratio\u201d to lessen the dividend decline. Currently, the company pays 65%-75% of earnings as dividends. German auto giant Volkswagen has a forward dividend yield of 8.46%. Its stock has risen 3.94% in the year to date. Over the last 12 months, its stock has fallen 5.32%. The stock is trading at EUR 107.15, the steepest discount to fair value in the Global Markets Renewable Energy Index. Nicolas Owens notes that Volkswagen \u201cis successfully executing a global automotive strategy and has one of the most aggressive plans to switch to battery electric vehicles from internal combustion powertrains.\u201d Rounding out our list is another German auto giant, Mercedes-Benz, with a forward yield of 8.28%. Its stock is up 10.79% so far this year. Over the last 12 months, its stock is down 4.26%. The stock is currently trading at EUR 64 per share. Analyst Krzysztof Smalec writes that \u201cdespite near-term headwinds, our long-term outlook is unchanged, and we reiterate our EUR 117 per share fair value estimate.\u201d"

        "body": "Though natural gas remains the dominant fuel source for US power generation (accounting for over 40% of generation in the first quarter of 2024), the overwhelming majority of new capacity additions have been concentrated in renewable energy, including solar, wind, and battery storage. Natural gas benefits from its US abundance (low cost) and baseload qualities. But coal generation has steadily declined since mid-2021: Wind and solar power appear to be taking over this share of the market, with notable upward progress in the past two quarters. Renewables (excluding hydroelectricity) accounted for nearly all new generation capacity in first-quarter 2024. They benefit from their zero-emission profile, low cost, tax incentives, and small average investment size (no large project risk). We expect renewables to continue to comprise the bulk of new capacity additions, with select natural gas additions to ensure reliability. Looking longer-term, we believe wind and solar will rise to nearly 45% of generation by 2032, approximately 3 times current levels. The bulk of the share gains will be from coal, which we forecast to continue to decline because of its high emission profile. Solar capacity additions rose 155% between the first quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, up to 5.9 gigawatts from 2.3 gigawatts. We expect 2024 additions to surpass 2023\u2032s record. Based on EIA data for planned capacity additions in 2024, net solar capacity additions are expected to see another year of strong growth. Overall, the EIA anticipates more than 35 gigawatts of installed solar to be added. Over the medium term, renewed uncertainty regarding solar panel imports could delay projects, like what we saw in 2022. In March 2024, a group of US solar manufacturers filed an antidumping/countervailing duty petition against certain Southeast Asian countries. This has created increased uncertainty in the market regarding future imports. Ultimately, we believe the current administration will balance the interests of US manufacturers with solar developers, ensuring any bottleneck does not persist for too long. Onshore wind installations, for their part, fell another 30% for a third consecutive quarter, down to 1.26 gigawatts from 1.8 gigawatts in first-quarter 2023, largely because of US tax credit policy. While we still expect 2024 installations to represent near-trough levels, based on EIA pipeline data, the industry should rebound in the coming years. The Inflation Reduction Act supports a long-term extension of the wind tax credit, which we expect to drive a rebound in industry activity. GE Vernova GEV, given its leading market share in US onshore wind, should benefit from the anticipated recovery in onshore wind installations in coming years. Improving profitability in the company\u2019s wind segment is a key part to achieving its long-term profitability targets. California\u2019s widely anticipated Net Energy Metering 3.0 policy change came into effect in 2023, spurring a surge in customer demand in the third quarter as customers rushed to install rooftop solar and take advantage of grandfathering under the prior regulatory regime. However, that demand started to dissipate in fourth-quarter 2023, and it remained weak in first-quarter 2024. We see cost declines or interest rates as key potential catalysts to stimulate non-California demand. As California adjusts to this new regulatory regime, we expect installations will continue to decrease, but the state will maintain its top spot for installations. It\u2019s states with large populations and low penetration, such as Florida and Texas, that will be critical to long-term rooftop solar growth in the US. California demand also continues to drive residential battery installations; they increased 33% compared with the same quarter last year. We see this uptick as insight into the rest of 2024 and beyond as battery installations pair well with other renewable sources. California is seeing a sharp uptick in batteries added to installed solar systems because of the NEM 3.0 policy change. Attachment rates reached approximately 50% in recent months versus roughly 10% a year earlier, and we expect them to continue to rise over the long term. We see Brookfield Renewable Partners as the most attractive valuations in the renewable energy space. Brookfield Renewable Partners BEP Brookfield Renewable holds a well-diversified global portfolio of clean energy technologies assets. The company targets 12%-15% returns (best-in-class) via a combination of organic growth and mergers and acquisitions. Acquisitions are central to Brookfield\u2019s strategy, in which it invests alongside Brookfield Asset Management\u2019s private equity funds. We think the current market volatility provides opportunities for Brookfield to find attractive deals, as evidenced by its history (Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating of Exemplary).

        "body": "An eclectic group of 10 companies is pushing the envelope to grapple with climate change, according to a new study by Morningstar Sustainalytics. Just one of the companies, Walmart WMT, hails from the United States. The rest include Canadian Natural Resources CNQ, Taiwan Semiconductor 2330, Siemens SIE, Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories 500124, Cathay Financial 2882, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield URW, Lundin Mining LUN, Acciona Energias Renovables ANE, and Vodacom Group VOD.  The study, titled \u201cNavigating Material Climate Risks in the Global Equities Market,\u201d evaluates how companies are doing in the transition toward a low-carbon economy, given \u201cintensifying concerns\u201d about global warming and the rise of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming is a major threat to the financial system, posing financially relevant risks for companies in all sectors and all manner of investments. Thus, nations aim to limit global warming to well below 2.0 degrees Celsius and preferably at 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial levels, as negotiated in the 2015 Paris Agreement. That would involve adopting goals to hit net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a 45% reduction in emissions by 2030. [For a primer on net zero and other climate terms, read this.] A growing number of financial institutions are prioritizing climate change in their investment strategies, writes a team of analysts at Morningstar Sustainalytics. Increasingly, climate change is viewed as a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d that can intensify the impacts of a wide range of hazards facing people\u2019s occupations, livelihoods, and portfolios. Meanwhile, investors and companies are all facing pressure to meet emissions targets amid tightening regulations, political debates, and the physical impacts of climate change. All these pose risks but also opportunities. The new study integrates the Sustainalytics Low Carbon Transition Rating, Physical Climate Risk Metrics, ESG Risk Ratings, and Morningstar equity research. (The transition rating expresses a company\u2019s alignment with a net zero economy as the temperature increase above preindustrial levels that would occur if the entire global economy were as misaligned as this company. For example, firms between 3\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C are considered highly misaligned.) The study looks at 3,373 companies for which Sustainalytics provides a Low Carbon Transition Rating and which are in the Morningstar Global Markets Large-Mid Cap Index. It also assesses the companies using Sustainalytics\u2019 Physical Climate Risk Metrics. Virtually all the companies are \u201cto some extent misaligned\u201d with net zero targets, the study found. Meanwhile, companies generally underreported carbon emissions, especially the scope 3 emissions that aren\u2019t in their direct control. And while physical climate risks \u201cvary widely,\u201d companies in most sectors face estimated losses of between 1% and 5% of their operating cash flow annually. Still, the analysts identified 10 companies that lead their sectors. We list them in the table below, as well as relevant metrics if you\u2019d like to research them further as investments. 1. Vodacom Group  2. Canadian Natural Resources  3. Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield  Analyst: Alexander Prineas Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield was formed in 1968, acquiring several large malls through to 1995 and offices thereafter. In 2000, it launched a conventions and exhibitions business and is now a European leader in the sector. In 2007, Unibail merged with Rodamco, becoming the largest retail REIT in continental Europe. Alexander Prineas writes in a recent report, \u201cThe group\u2019s assets remain high quality, owning centers that are among the best in Europe and the US. Its iconic assets include the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris, Westfield Mall of Scandinavia in Stockholm, Westfield centers at Stratford and Shepherd\u2019s Bush in London, the Westfield World Trade Center in New York, and many flagship malls throughout California. We expect URW\u2019s malls to perform strongly, particularly as rival low-quality malls in the US close their doors. However, URW\u2019s large debt load puts the balance sheet under pressure. URW was able to issue debt during the covid-19 crisis at cheap prices but needs to reduce debt.\u201d 4. Cathay Financial Holding  5. Siemens  Analyst: Matthew Donen Siemens is a disparate portfolio of high-quality businesses in different sectors. The spinoff of its cyclical energy and wind turbine divisions has enhanced the group\u2019s return profile and provides more durable returns than in the past. Further deconsolidation appears unlikely. All its businesses have strong product portfolios to compete in long-term attractive end markets that benefit from the secular growth trends of digitalization and the energy transition. In a recent report, equity analyst Matthew Donen writes, \u201cSiemens entered its 2024 financial year with a healthy order backlog, which, combined with robust demand for electrical products within its smart infrastructure segment, supports our 4% organic revenue growth forecast for 2024, offsetting short-cycle weakness in automation. Our slight downward revision to fiscal 2024 organic revenue is driven by the ongoing destocking for automation products, particularly in China. We forecast annualized organic revenue growth of 5% during our five-year forecast.\u201d 6. Corporacion Acciona Energ\u00eda Internacional  Analyst: Tancrede Fulop, CFA A renewables developer, Acciona Energia was spun off from Spain industrial conglomerate Acciona in July 2021. The floating share is 17.3%. The rationale of the IPO was to revive capacity growth that had been subdued since a 2013 regulatory change in Spain drove a sharp cut in renewables\u2019 returns. Equity analyst Tancrede Fulop notes in a recent report that \u201c70% of Acciona Energia\u2019s capacity is onshore wind, 7% hydro dams, 18% solar photovoltaic, and 2% is battery. 44% of its capacity is in Spain. The three biggest markets outside Spain are the US, Mexico, and Australia.\u201d Fulop adds that \u201cThe firm targets an internal rate of return 200-300 basis points above its weighted average cost of capital. We surmise it will achieve the lower end of the range.\u201d 7. Lundin Mining  8. Taiwan Semiconductor  Analyst: Phelix Lee Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world\u2019s largest dedicated contract chip manufacturer, or foundry. It makes integrated circuits for customers based on their proprietary IC designs. The firm has long benefited from semiconductor firms around the globe transitioning from integrated device manufacturers to fabless designers. Morningstar equity analyst Phelix Lee, in describing the bulls\u2019 perspective, recently wrote, \u201cTSMC should consistently earn higher gross margins than competitors thanks to its economies of scale and premium pricing justified by cutting-edge process technologies.\u201d 9. Walmart Analyst: Noah Rohr Writes Morningstar analyst Noah Rohr: \u201cWide-moat Walmart\u2019s unrivaled scale relative to its brick-and-mortar retail peers provides the firm with the rare ability to formidably adapt to a dynamic retail landscape. Walmart benefits from an expansive physical footprint and entrenched position in the communities it serves, putting the retailer in close proximity to the vast majority of US consumers. The firm\u2019s unique promise of a wide assortment of goods at low prices has allowed Walmart to retain its status as the nation\u2019s preeminent retailer for over 30 years. \u201cWe believe Walmart boasts a solid financial position as its $9 billion of cash on hand, $15 billion of undrawn lines of credit, modest amount of outstanding debt, and history of positive operating cash flows enable the firm to continue reinvesting in the business while making shareholder distributions.\u201d 10.

        "body": "Sometime in your investing journey, you\u2019ve probably encountered the term ESG. It celebrates its 20-year anniversary this year, and it stands for environmental, social and governance analysis of companies and investing. It evolved from an early approach called \u201csocially responsible investing.\u201d Sometimes, the term ESG is confused with the broader term \u201csustainable investing,\u201d which includes a wide array of approaches, including ESG analysis. (You can learn more about the prehistory of ESG here.) As the planet warms, and as younger consumers and investors make sustainability a priority, ESG has never been more financially relevant. But while it\u2019s been roundly criticized in recent years, it\u2019s here for good. We asked Morningstar analysts and other sustainable-investing experts how it came about, and what the next 20 years may hold. ESG evolved from values-based investing as people sought more systematic ways to describe risks that weren\u2019t strictly financial. In 2004, the UN Global Compact published \u201cWho Cares Wins,\u201d which discussed the concept of \u201cenvironmental, social and governance\u201d factors to describe these nonfinancial issues. It provided a systematic way of accounting for nonfinancial risks\u2014the changing climate, say, or human rights violations\u2015and rejected the view that investment should happen from a purely financial perspective. \u201cIn many cases, for example, responsible investors are compensating for a lack of effective public policy,\u201d says Thomas Kuh, head of ESG Strategy for Morningstar Indexes. Next, the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer showed that ESG issues are relevant for financial valuation and consistent with fiduciary duty. That laid the groundwork for using ESG analysis. Its report was commissioned by the United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative, the first of a number of studies showing that fiduciaries needed to consider ESG issues, when they were material. The same UN body launched the Principles for Responsible Investment in 2006, creating a framework for institutional investors to incorporate ESG into their investment processes. The Freshfields report \u201cwas a turning point. It said that not only are investment funds allowed to include nonfinancial factors, but that they arguably must, because the time horizon for what\u2019s material to financial returns is long and nonfinancial factors present all sorts of risk and opportunities for investors,\u201d says Lisa Cooper, founder, Figure 8 Investing Strategies. \u201cSoon you had big European pension plans asking banks and asset managers to figure it out.\u201d  In 2015, the Paris Climate Accord and the Sustainable Development Goals were signed. The Paris Agreement, now ratified by 180-plus countries, sets goals for curbing global warming. The UN also established Sustainable Development Goals, calling for nations to address challenges related to poverty, inequality, climate change, and peace by 2030. The SDGs embrace actions that corporations and others can take to achieve the goals. This sets a framework by which business leaders and investors could speak the same language and work toward shared targets.  Soon after, \u201cCorporate Sustainability: First Evidence on Materiality\u201d was published, which showed that focusing on financially relevant ESG factors had a positive effect on shareholder value. For example, \u201cIf climate change matters for investors\u2019 decisions, then climate risk is material even if the company is not inclined to state that in regulatory documents,\u201d says Kuh. Issues that weren\u2019t on investors\u2019 radar were now financially relevant. The 2008 global financial crisis showed how unchecked financial system weaknesses could erode value. Investors began framing the climate crisis as a market failure, providing momentum for the Paris Agreement, says Jackie Cook, who leads the proxy-voting advisory service for Morningstar Sustainalytics. As they adopted ESG analysis, investors found new risks. Consider factory farming, where ESG analysis underscored risks such as food contamination and labor issues. The coronavirus pandemic disproportionately affected vulnerable communities and thrust companies in the public glare. \u201cRemember workers in slaughterhouses continuing to work during covid? Suddenly, people realized \u2018Oh, we\u2019re looking at ESG issues,\u2019\u201d says Maria Lettini, executive director of US SIF, the trade organization for sustainable investing. \u201cCovid highlighted how food system risk affects economies and commodities and access to food.\u201d To help address the challenges of achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the G20 and Financial Stability Board created the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to help people understand \u201ccarbon-related assets in the financial sectors.\u201d TCFD would become a regulated reporting requirement across many global regions. By 2022, 61% of G250 companies disclosed information in line with at least one of the framework\u2019s pillars. In 2018, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink urged fellow CEOs to position for long-term profitability by focusing on the role of the corporation in society. Companies focused on minimizing negative environmental and social impacts and accentuating positive ones would be rewarded by customers, protect their brands, and attract top talent, enabling them to better navigate the transition to an increasingly low-carbon and digital economy, Fink wrote. Previously, the economist Milton Friedman\u2019s doctrine of shareholder primacy held sway. By 2019, the powerful Business Roundtable also reversed its stance on shareholder primacy, saying that other stakeholders\u2014customers, employees, suppliers, communities\u2014are also important. \u201cThe shift toward a stakeholder view of the firm and how it should be governed was already happening well before the COVID pandemic\u2014fueled by a post-financial crisis awakening to the systemic vulnerabilities introduced by short-termism, as well as a growing urgency for global action to halt climate change,\u201d says Cook of Sustainalytics. \u201cHowever, [the pandemic] brought to the fore fundamental flaws in shareholder primacy-style governance. The economic and political fallout ignited a collective awareness of the overlapping interests of stakeholder groups in securing resilience across systems.\u201d In 2016, Morningstar introduced the Sustainability Rating for funds and ETFs and established its sustainability indexes. Jon Hale, a prominent sustainable-investing commentator and former Morningstar head of sustainability research, helped create the rating. Hale recalls: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how complex and sophisticated the frameworks had gotten. I asked Joe [Mansueto, Morningstar\u2019s founder], \u2018Can we do this?\u2019 He said, \u2018Sure.\u2019 And once he said that, then people said, OK, we\u2019ll shake loose some resources. When we launched the rating, it focused attention on sustainable investing. Academic papers were written. Morningstar had given its stamp of approval on this idea of sustainable investing. It got a lot of heads nodding.\u201d  More big investors began to use ESG analysis. \u201cIn 2014, we noticed in our trends reporting that the biggest jump was in the use of the ESG integration strategy,\u201d says Bryan McGannon, managing director of US SIF, the trade group for the sustainable-investing industry. \u201cIt began to permeate mainstream finance.\u201d As the value proposition grew clear, consolidation took place throughout the sustainable-investing ecosystem. Eaton Vance bought Calvert Research & Management in 2016, followed by Impax purchasing Pax World Management, both prominent sustainable-investing boutiques. In 2017, Morningstar took a stake in data and analytics provider Sustainalytics, which provided the data for its fund sustainability ratings, and bought the rest of the firm in 2020. Morningstar analysts covered socially responsible funds PAX World Fund, Dreyfus Third Century, and the Calvert funds, starting in the 1980s. Sustainalytics established global ESG research and ratings offerings in 2010 and expanded its offering to include governance research and carbon solutions in 2015. Morningstar\u2019s approach to its own corporate sustainability drew on its approach to research, centering on independence, materiality, and transparency. \u201cWe\u2019re founded on the idea that investors deserve transparency into what\u2019s in their portfolios and the tools to make better decisions,\u201d said Gabriel Presler, global head of enterprise sustainability for Morningstar. \u201cStakeholders, meaning our employees, shareholders, and clients, deserve that same transparency. Environmental, social, and governance information provides stakeholders with a more complete view of an issuer or investment or an organization\u2015not only its value in the market and the risk it presents, but also the externalities, good and bad, it is creating.\u201d In 2017, the European Commission presented its sustainable finance action plan to refocus capital on a low-carbon economy. The plan included proposals for regulation of disclosures on sustainable investment and sustainability risks. The European Green Deal came in 2019, followed by a separate plan to help companies and investors identify economic activities that are environmentally sustainable, as well as an anti-greenwashing rule that makes fund managers and others communicate the environmental and social impact of their transactions. Such moves accelerated the adoption of ESG. By 2023, Morningstar\u2019s coverage of ESG funds was worth $2.8 trillion dollars, with Europe representing more than 80% of these global ESG fund assets. It was a big year in 2023: The EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive became law, new sustainability reporting standards were finalized, and California enacted two broad-based climate-related reporting laws. In 2024, the SEC finally adopted a sweeping rule to make companies listed in the US report climate-related risks and their plans to adapt to them. Today, according to the SEC, some 90% of companies in the Russell 1000 Index already disclose this kind of sustainability data. Other jurisdictions go further than the SEC: For example, companies that do business in Europe or California are preparing to make more detailed disclosures than what the SEC requires. (For more on sustainability reporting requirements around the globe, download Morningstar\u2019s \u201cSustainability Reporting Requirements\u201d white paper). Increasingly, people use the term ESG investing for a vast array of approaches, whether investing according to their values, such as screening out stocks or finding companies that have an impact, or pursuing values based on nonfinancial factors, or some combination of approaches. ESG as a tool becomes conflated with the broader notion of sustainable investing. Properly understood, ESG is an analytical framework that uses ESG factors to approach an investment, says Morningstar\u2019s Kuh. \u201cIt\u2019s is a useful tool for informing investment decisions.\u201d There is no such thing as an \u201cESG company,\u201d for example. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2021, highlighted contradictions, inconsistencies, and conflicts between the E, the S, and the G, points out Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research for Morningstar Sustainalytics. For example, in Europe, governments reneged on their environmental goals by turning to fossil fuels to reduce dependence on Russian gas. The war also boosted oil and gas shares, making fossil-fuel-light ESG funds underperform by comparison. It highlighted the need for a strong defense industry, \u201csomething that doesn\u2019t align with the values of investors focused on sustainability,\u201d says Bioy. Meanwhile, as fund managers chased after new clients, greenwashing charges grew\u2014just as critiques of sustainable investing were on the rise. In 2023, DWS, an investment firm controlled by Deutsche Bank, settled with the SEC over misstatements regarding its ESG investing. Separately, critics slammed ESG on grounds that it overpromises on performance or reduces motivation by governments to solve climate change. Others said it violates fiduciary duty because it ventures outside the economic interest, narrowly defined, of investors. Says Kuh: \u201cGreenwashing can be seen as primarily overreach on the part of fund managers but also unrealistic expectations on the part of investors.\u201d In 2021, Texas prohibited government contracts with companies it thought were punishing the fossil fuel and firearms industries and banned public pension funds from using ESG principles in investing. Republican opponents also slammed companies for venturing into social issues, dubbing ESG \u201cwoke capitalism.\u201d This year, Florida effectively bans the term \u201cclimate change\u201d from its state laws.  Today, dozens of states have passed either pro- or anti-ESG bills related to financial institutions and other large companies. The decisions have financial consequences: Wharton says decisions to ban certain banks as municipal bond underwriters in Texas means cities will pay an additional $303 million to $532 million in interest on $32 billion in bonds. As the term \u201cESG\u201d became a political football, companies and investors shied away: BlackRock CEO Fink said he\u2019d stop using it because it\u2019s become weaponized on both sides, the right and the left, and it\u2019s become too polarizing. Says Andy Behar, CEO of shareholder advocate As You Sow: \u201cESG is about the relationship between shareholders and companies they own. Companies need to disclose [ESG information] honestly and in a standardized format for shareholders to make a good decision,\u201d much as the SEC required standardized financial disclosures decades ago."

        "body": "There are more than 50,000 sustainability indexes. They\u2019ve played an important role in the growth of sustainable investing, representing strategies ranging from ESG to climate to impact, according to a 2022 Index Industry Association survey. The indexes cover a range of asset classes, countries and regions, size segments, factors, and themes. Climate-investing indexes alone encompass ex-fossil fuel, low carbon, climate transition, and investment themes like green bonds, renewable energy, clean technology, and climate solutions. Since environmental, social, and governance investing turns 20 years old this year, it\u2019s worth looking at where ESG indexes come from\u2014and the origin story of the first ESG index. The early history of sustainable investing was shaped by entrepreneurs. In the early days of sustainable investing, there were no established standards and practices. Yet the early ESG index entrepreneurs forged ahead, developing tools and products to address a vision of aligning portfolios with investor values and their views about sustainability. A prominent example is the Domini 400 Social Index (Domini 400), launched in May 1990. With a track record of over 34 years, it is the first ESG index and has the longest continuous performance history. It has served as the basis of investable products since June 1991 and is the benchmark for the popular and widely followed iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF DSI. What is so special about this index that it has withstood the test of time? The story behind the Domini 400 is instructive for understanding the development of sustainable investments and the crucial role of indexes in the evolution of new investment practices. The index was originally the brainchild of Peter Kinder, Steve Lydenberg, and Amy Domini, founders of Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co. of one of the first socially responsible investing research firms. Based on its long track record and consistent methodology, the Domini 400 Index is widely cited in academic and practitioner literature analyzing the financial performance of ESG investments. Every index has a purpose and an investment thesis. KLD created the Domini 400 to provide data to identify coverage of companies that meet ethical and ESG standards and provide data on the risk and return characteristics of SRI. KLD\u2019s founders believed that companies exhibiting strong ESG credentials could also manage risk and perform well over the long run. This perspective challenged the prevailing view that limiting one\u2019s investment universe would be a drag on performance. (After becoming the first managing director of indexes at KLD in the early 2000s, I had the opportunity to observe the workings of the Domini 400 committee and then shepherd the index through some of its later incarnations, from 2001 to 2017.)  Like an old house that adapts and changes to stay relevant in a more modern world, the Domini 400\u2032s methodology evolved over time, paralleling the evolution of sustainable investing. KLD initially constructed the Domini 400 by applying product-based exclusions (alcohol, tobacco, gambling, military weapons, and nuclear power) and then selecting companies whose records on community, employee relations, environment, product quality and safety, and women and minorities (later called diversity) stood out from their peers. The process started with constituents of the S&P 500, then considered to be the best benchmark for the US equity market. Aiming for similar sector diversification, the committee selected about half its constituents, added about 100 mid-cap companies that stood out in their industries, and about 50 small caps with exemplary records, for a total of 400. Like with the S&P 500, constituent decisions were made by a dedicated committee based on written guidelines. In the absence of accepted standards and systematic research on ESG issues, KLD developed its own analytical framework and conducted its own research. This was a herculean task in the predigital world where pertinent information was scarce, particularly around ESG. Companies did not routinely disclose relevant data, were reticent to respond to questionnaires, and rarely returned phone calls. KLD scoured newspapers, periodicals, journals, and government databases, and it sought information from nonprofits about companies and issues. The internet was a boon to ESG research as information became more abundant and accessible. Companies began publishing sustainability reports, and corporate stakeholders gained a platform to advocate for more sustainable business practices. The combination of Big Data and quantum computing power greatly expanded the range of data used in ESG ratings. It also contributed to greater corporate transparency, giving shareholders more material information on ESG issues for making investment decisions. Today, 96% of S&P 500 companies publish sustainability reports, up from 20% in 2011. The Domini 400 went through several name changes during its first two decades, reflecting the transition of ESG investing from niche to mainstream: KLD 400 Social Index, FTSE KLD 400 Social Index, and MSCI KLD 400 Social Index. Its methodology also changed in response to advances in ESG research, best practices in index management, and the evolving preferences of ESG investors. The framework added analysis of corporate governance and human rights, as well as screens for civilian firearms, thermal coal, and other topics. Today the index is entirely rules-based, uses ESG ratings (which did not exist in the 1990s) and controversy scores, and has greater emphasis on climate-related issues. Stock market indexes may appear to be dry, technical financial tools. But they play an integral role in capital markets as scorekeepers, facilitators, and validators. As scorekeepers, they provide a stream of objective data on risk, return, financial fundamentals, and other factors. As facilitators, they are tools for passive investments and performance benchmarks for actively managed strategies. As validators, they test the financial efficacy of the data used in their construction. Similarly, ESG indexes provide transparent, rules-based, and cost-efficient exposure to ESG, climate, and impact factors. Their rules codify new approaches to investment. They function like the broad market capitalization-weighted indexes that most investors are familiar with, noting that their credibility is primarily determined by the quality of the underlying sustainability data and the index methodology. So, investors should verify that their ESG benchmark comes from a trustworthy index provider and the sustainability data inputs come from a reputable source. Scorekeepers. In addition to their function as performance benchmarks, ESG indexes enable investors to measure sustainability characteristics related to ESG, climate, and impact of different investment approaches. For example, with the growing interest in climate investing, investors can now measure the carbon intensity of their investments and compare it with that of a climate transition fund and a broad market beta fund. So, sustainability indexes are benchmarks for measuring both financial and sustainability standards. Facilitators. Passive funds based on ESG indexes represent approximately 30% of the $3 trillion total assets in global sustainable funds with 39% of US sustainable assets in passive funds, according to a recent Morningstar report. Investors are attracted by the transparency and low cost, in line with global trends favoring passive investments. Validators. By providing information on how well sustainability data achieves its objectives, indexes are a proving ground for this sustainability data. Perhaps the most important contribution the Domini 400 story illustrates is how the disciplined and systematic data requirements of indexes contributed to the advance of ESG research. KLD created company-level ESG scores\u2014precursors to ESG ratings\u2014to support its growing index business. Today, the use of ESG research in portfolio management has benefited from the strict quality standards that indexes require. Politicians criticizing ESG investing claim that it violates fiduciary duty, challenging evidence that ESG strategies can generate risk-adjusted returns that match or exceed the market. By providing unbiased financial and sustainability data, ESG indexes will be instrumental in adjudicating this dispute. While the founders of KLD may not have anticipated the growth trajectory and popularity of sustainable investing, the essential purpose of the Domini 400 Index set the stage for a new class of financial benchmarks that have had\u2015and will continue to have\u2014a profound impact on the investment landscape."

        "body": "IShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF HYG provides broad exposure to US high-yield corporate bonds. But difficulties trading these bonds limit its breadth and hamper the advantages of its market-value-weighted portfolio. The fund tracks the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid High Yield Index, which holds the most-liquid portion of the US high-yield corporate-bond market. Eligible bonds must have at least $400 million in outstanding face value and 1.5 years remaining until maturity. There\u2019s also an issuer-level minimum outstanding face value threshold. The index excludes certain types of bonds, including those with equity and convertible features, floating-rate notes, and bonds from emerging-market issuers. It weights bonds by their market value, subject to a 3% cap on issuers\u2019 weighting in the index. The resulting portfolio holds a broad and diversified slice of the US high-yield bond market. However, a broad indexing approach leaves much to be desired. The wide return dispersion among the lowest-rated bonds puts it at a disadvantage relative to its Morningstar Category peers. Active managers with more flexibility and sound credit research can use more discretion with riskier bonds to better exploit those that are mispriced. Some managers may take on a small stake in bonds rated BBB to cushion the portfolio during credit shocks. The index has some shortcomings. It leaves out the less-liquid portion of the market to alleviate transaction costs, but this limits its opportunity set. And market-value weighting tilts the fund toward the most indebted issuers. Recent fee cuts from other passive high-yield bond funds make the fund\u2019s 0.49% annual fee less attractive, though it still lands in the cheapest quintile of its category. Despite being cheaper than average, it has struggled to consistently outperform the category average. The fund has a middling track record with fleeting bursts of outperformance, despite its fee advantage. It outpaced the category average by only 8 basis points annualized from its 2007 inception through March 2024. The fund invests across the credit rating spectrum in the high-yield market, and its broad scope allows it to capture credit rallies well. It outperformed the category average by 1.80 percentage points as the market recovered from the coronavirus-driven drawdown between late March and December 2020 when credit spreads rapidly compressed. However, the wider return distribution among the lowest-rated bonds can dent its performance more than its actively managed category peers with more flexibility. It lagged the category average by 1.57 percentage points at the trough of the pandemic shock in early 2020 and 1.01 percentage points during the 2022 market meltdown. Difficulties continued in 2023. The fund trailed its average peer by 49 basis points between September and October 2023, when credit spreads rapidly widened as sticky inflation data pushed back expectations for rate cuts. It recouped this loss in the last two months of 2023 as the market bounced back and credit spreads tightened. This episode demonstrates the fund\u2019s volatility. Its standard deviation of returns clocked in at 9.86% from its 2007 inception through March 2024, versus the category average of 8.78%. The fund\u2019s risk-adjusted return (as measured by Sharpe ratio) was slightly lower than the category average over this period."

        "body": "Spot ethereum exchange-traded funds made their US market debut on July 23, 2024. The nine new ETFs, including one converted from an existing trust, are listed below: In a surprise move in May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved 19b-4 proposals for the first spot ethereum ETFs in the US. It\u2019s the first cryptocurrency to receive such approval since spot bitcoin ETFs burst onto the scene this January. Spot ethereum ETFs will directly hold ether, the cryptocurrency that supports the ethereum blockchain. Ether currently trades on cryptocurrency exchanges, like Coinbase COIN, and is the second-largest cryptocurrency to bitcoin. Like spot bitcoin ETFs, spot ethereum ETFs will be set up as grantor trusts, meaning investors will own a share of the ether held by the trust. The main difference between spot ethereum ETFs and spot bitcoin ETFs is the cryptocurrency they hold; otherwise, they should be much the same. Spot ethereum ETFs all offer the same exposure to ether. Picking the best ETF for you depends on a few things, which we refer to as the total cost of ETF ownership: 1. Trading Costs First, crypto ETF traders that buy and sell often should focus on the most liquid ETF, meaning the one with tight bid-ask spreads and substantial assets. We don\u2019t know which ETF will serve as the liquidity center for ethereum ETFs right off the bat, but it may start with Grayscale and its head start on assets. If spot bitcoin ETFs are an indicator, expect iShares and Fidelity to quickly take over Grayscale as the top ethereum ETFs by assets and volume. Best bets: iShares Ethereum Trust ETF and Fidelity Ethereum Fund. 2. Holdings Costs Other ETFs may have small differences that impact holding costs, but spot ethereum ETFs uniformity distills these costs down to fees. The difference between a 15- and 25 basis-point fee is small, so even buy-and-hold investors should balance fees with trading costs and choose an issuer with staying power. Best bets: Anything other than Grayscale Ethereum Trust. 3. Issuer Preference Crypto ethos may be important to investors, and issuers vary on their commitment to crypto. Choosing an issuer that gives back to the crypto community may hold an edge for such investors. Best bets: Bitwise Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, and Fidelity Ethereum Fund. 1. Fees Fee wars broke out in ethereum ETF S-1 filings as issuers jockeyed for position as the low-cost provider. Fee waivers only build on spot ethereum ETF\u2019s advantage over current alternatives, like ethereum futures ETFs, which start for a fee of 0.66% to as high as 2.50% for Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE. Grayscale plans to keep the same fee after converting its private trust to an ETF, so spot ethereum ETF\u2019s fee advantage only extends to the other seven ETFs. New buyers of ethereum ETFs should avoid the expensive Grayscale ETF. 2. Futures Drag on Performance Futures-based ETFs typically gain exposure to ether by holding the ethereum futures contract that\u2019s closest to expiring. Each month, the fund has to sell out of the expiring contract and roll into the next month. The further from expiration, the higher the price, so these ETFs end up paying a higher price for the same ether exposure at each futures roll. The cost is small, but the advent of spot ethereum ETFs renders it pointless. ETFs\u2019 tax magic comes from their in-kind creation/redemption process, which means they don\u2019t have to sell holdings (and therefore realize capital gains) to meet redemptions. Spot ethereum ETFs won\u2019t benefit from these in-kind creations or redemptions (at least, not yet). The SEC only approved cash creations and redemptions, meaning the ETF will need to bear the costs of buying and selling ether when ETF shares are created or redeemed. Trading costs could eat away at the edges of spot ethereum ETF performance. The extent of these costs remains to be seen. Investors on the fence about whether to buy a spot ethereum ETF may prefer to stick with traditional ETFs until this inefficiency is resolved. Staking is at the heart of the SEC\u2019s issue with ether. Cryptocurrencies run on blockchains, which are ledgers validated by peers (bitcoin miners, for example) rather than intermediaries. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system that rewards the first miner to validate a block and add it to the blockchain. Unlike bitcoin, ethereum uses a proof-of-stake model after switching from proof-of-work in 2022, commonly known as The Merge. The proof-of-stake model operates more like a lottery system than a competition: Rather than being first to mine rewards, ether holders could \u201cstake\u201d (that is, commit) their ether to be used to update the ledger and receive rewards. Staking generates passive income for ether investors willing to lock up their coins. The SEC sued Coinbase based on this interpretation, claiming that staked tokens qualify as investment contracts and should therefore be considered securities (Coinbase disagreed). The SEC relies on precedent known as the Howey Test in its conclusion. Where bitcoin fails and ether passes the Howey Test is in the expectation of profits from the efforts of others. Bitcoin miners earn their rewards, while staked ether is lent for rewards, almost like interest on a savings account. The SEC approved these ETF filings only after staking was disallowed for the ETFs. The average annual reward for ether staking is roughly 2-4 percentage points. Unlike bitcoin, holding ether directly could hold a meaningful performance edge over spot ethereum ETFs for investors willing to engage in staking. Unlike bitcoin, holding ether directly could hold a meaningful performance edge over spot ether ETFs for investors willing to engage in staking. As to ether\u2019s viability as an investment, ether is a cryptocurrency that should continue to garner investor attention. Ethereum is a major platform that operates using ether as its cryptocurrency. Ether\u2019s $420 billion market cap was second only to bitcoin\u2019s $1.3 trillion market cap as of July 19, 2024. No other cryptocurrency was particularly close to its size. That said, any ethereum price predictions are guesswork and should be taken with a grain of salt. Ethereum is highly volatile, and investors should only invest as much as they are willing to lose. While the SEC decision-making process around crypto has been mercurial, I don\u2019t expect approval of other cryptocurrencies without them first having a regulated market. So far, that regulated market has been Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures. Spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs were made possible by predecessor bitcoin and ethereum futures ETFs, the futures held by those ETFs being listed on the CME. But the CME doesn\u2019t currently list any other cryptocurrency futures. It stands to reason that ETF approval is distant for cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin and ethereum.   "

        "body": "Ryan Jackson: Even the best investments can go through slumps. Whether it\u2019s because the market they target is out of favor, a couple of bad calls set them back, or some combination of both, rough patches are an unavoidable\u2014and unenjoyable\u2014part of investing. But when good ETFs perform badly, their outlook may grow brighter. That makes the bottom of the barrel an intriguing place to hunt for new investments. In that spirit, here are three ETFs whose shaky recent performance leaves them with compelling upside potential. Let\u2019s start overseas with Vanguard Total International Stock ETF, which trades under the ticker VXUS. This market-cap-weighted index fund holds nearly every stock in the foreign market. That broad reach and its low fee earn it a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold. This fund stands out for its diversification. Its 8,500 holdings come in various shapes and sizes. The top 10 of them represent less than 10% of the portfolio, and its 20% stake in financials marks its largest sector allocation. The strategy provides an accurate snapshot of the foreign stock market, which should amplify the impact of its rock-bottom fee. It may be harsh to say this fund is in a slump. Long term, it has measured up well against its peers in the foreign large-blend Morningstar Category. The problem is that foreign stocks have lagged well behind their US rivals\u2014a trend that has persisted since VXUS hit the market in 2011. Over the past decade, the fund trailed behind its US counterpart in 83% of rolling 12-month periods. There\u2019s no telling when\u2014or if\u2014the foreign-stock breakout will come, but VXUS looks relatively cheap right now. It traded at 15 times earnings as of April 2024 compared to 24 times for the US market. That runway may serve it well in the years to come. Coming back stateside, let\u2019s turn to iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, ticker IJR. This small-cap strategy has scuffled recently. It gained a paltry 2.1% from the start of the year through May 20, nearly 10 percentage points behind the S&P 500 and worse than 85% of small-blend peers. But this index strategy boasts a Silver Medalist Rating for good reasons. Its benchmark applies liquidity and profitability screens that filter out a lot of the junk that plagues more-lenient small-cap products. The index is also market-cap-weighted. That cost-efficient approach allows the fund to charge just a 0.06% fee\u2014far cheaper than its active rivals. Years of trailing larger stocks have left small caps with plenty of room to grow. According to the Morningstar price/fair value ratio, they traded at a 20% discount entering May. Large caps came at just a 1% discount that has likely already vanished. IJR is a good way to target small caps on sale. Sticky inflation and the higher interest rates that followed have made it a tough couple of years for bond strategies. There\u2019s no guarantee the hard times are over, but with yields near their highest levels in more than a decade, the outlook is attractive for bonds. Bronze-rated Invesco Total Return Bond ETF, ticker GTO, is a good way to capitalize. This active offering sits in the intermediate core-plus bond Morningstar Category. It lost 3.7% annually over the three years through April 2024, which ranked in the middle third of its peer group. It has stayed mostly flat this calendar year, shedding 0.2% from Jan. 1 through May 20. But there\u2019s reason for optimism. The portfolio managers at the helm delivered strong long-term results on the open-end version of the strategy. It\u2019s a collaborative group with a wealth of experience and broad resources at their disposal\u2014a combination that merits an Above Average People Pillar rating. The team executes a strategy that pairs its macro views with bottom-up credit research. The top-down component considers broad economic and market conditions, an important backdrop for the best security ideas proposed by corporate credit and securitized analysts. All told, it\u2019s a sensible, repeatable strategy that should bode well if the tide turns for bonds. Watch 3 Solid ETFs Off to a Slow Start in 2024 for more from Ryan Jackson."

        "body": "IShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF\u2019s AGG conservative portfolio and razor-thin expense ratio make it a compelling option. IShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF tracks the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, which includes taxable, investment-grade US bonds with at least one year until maturity. Issuing activity in that market, which is dominated by US Treasuries, will dictate the portfolio\u2019s composition. Market-value weighting emphasizes the most liquid issues by harnessing the market\u2019s collective wisdom on the relative value of each bond. The US investment-grade bond market is highly efficient and liquid, giving this fund an edge on pricier active strategies that must take greater risk to recoup their fees. Active managers allocate a higher percentage of assets to lower-quality bonds than this fund, and the performance of those credit-risky bonds helps steer peer-relative performance. About 74% of the fund\u2019s assets carry an AA or AAA credit rating, higher than most category peers as of May 2024. Some competitors also hold a small allocation to high-yield bonds; this fund does not. With less credit risk comes less reward, and IShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF leaves yield on the table by focusing on US Treasuries and other highly rated debt. Its average coupon and 12-month yield consistently lag the Morningstar Category average, both falling around half-a-percentage point short of the category norm, as of April 2024. However, the current rate environment gives even the safest portfolios an appetizing yield. The fund\u2019s SEC yield of 4.7% as of April 2024 is more than double what it was in early 2022. Since credit risk is muted, interest-rate risk primarily drives this fund\u2019s performance. Its average effective duration was 6.0 years as of May 2024. Its duration remains slightly little longer than the category average, despite it narrowing recently. This makes the fund more sensitive to interest-rate movements than some peers. From its 2003 inception through April 2024, iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF outperformed the category average by 19 basis points annualized, with similar volatility. Much of its outperformance can be attributed to its low fee and conservative credit risk profile, which helps protect the fund during credit shocks better than category peers. For instance, the fund outperformed the category average by 1.4 percentage points during the coronavirus-driven shock from Feb. 20, 2020, through March 23, 2020. On the other hand, IShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF\u2019s quality tilt has worked against it when credit spreads tightened. The fund lagged the category average by 1.6 percentage points when markets recovered from the pandemic-fueled selloff in the last nine months of 2020. A longer duration than peers can lead to underperformance when interest rates unexpectedly rise. In the final five months of 2016, when long-term bond yields climbed on the back of inflation concerns, the fund also trailed the category norm by 77 basis points. However, in the Fed\u2019s most-recent tightening cycle, the fund has held its own. From March 2022 through February 2024, it fared slightly better than the category norm, as lesser credit risk more than offset heightened interest-rate risk. Performance differences will occur from time to time, but long term, its conservative portfolio and razor-thin expense ratio should support a durable advantage."

        "body": "Investing against the crowd is not easy. Contrarian investors often make bold bets that may take time\u2014sometimes years or longer\u2014before paying off. Contrarian investing comes in many different shapes. It encompasses any strategy that diverges from mainstream market views on where and when to invest. One straightforward and commonly used contrarian approach is rebalancing a portfolio back to a target allocation. This requires investors to sell well-performing assets and buy underperforming ones. Rebalancing allows investors to consistently manage their portfolio risk in hopes of benefiting when market sentiment proves incorrect. Exchange-traded fund investors can deploy contrarian strategies by using value ETFs or those tracking fundamentally weighted indexes like Invesco FTSE RAFI US 1000 ETF PRF and Schwab Fundamental US Large Company ETF FNDX. Value ETFs typically hold only stocks that are cheap relative to their book value or a similar fundamental metric and often cut more expensive names. On the other hand, fundamentally weighted ETFs target the entire stock market, including growth stocks, but use metrics like operating cash flow, sales, and book value to size their positions instead of market cap. Their weightings reflect the current economic footprint of the underlying companies instead of relying on the market\u2019s opinion of future prospects, breaking the link between prices and portfolio weightings. For example, PRF weights the 1,000 largest constituents from the FTSE US All Cap Index by their fundamental size, which includes a firm\u2019s book value, sales, cash flow, and dividends (averaged over the trailing five years). Companies with large economic footprints top the portfolio, such as Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, ExxonMobil XOM, and Microsoft MSFT. In contrast, the strategy underweights companies with more growth built into their valuation. Nvidia NVDA made up only 0.17% of PRF at the end of April 2024, or 4.18 percentage points lower than its weighting in the Morningstar US Market Index. Shunning stocks whose prices have grown expensive relative to their fundamentals imparts a value orientation in line with more conventional market-cap-weighted value ETFs like iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF IWD. This has been evident in the average valuation of PRF and IWD, as shown in Exhibit 1. While IWD and PRF sport similar valuations, their construction philosophies differ. IWD selects stocks in the cheaper half of the market based on their price/book ratios. It then weights stocks by market cap. If a holding\u2019s price goes up, its weighting in IWD\u2019s portfolio increases, tilting it toward the largest and more expensive names. PRF does not screen for cheaper stocks. It targets the largest 1,000 US stocks across the value-growth spectrum and weights them by fundamental size. If a company\u2019s stock price declines relative to its fundamental size, PRF will increase its exposure at the next rebalance. Similarly, if a stock\u2019s price goes up relative to its fundamentals, PRF will trim its exposure. This buy-low, sell-high mechanism limits PRF\u2019s exposure to richly valued stocks and tilts it toward cheaper stocks, capturing the essence of value investing. To understand how fundamentally weighted strategies like PRF implement their contrarian bets differently from traditional value index funds, I will examine the buy-low, sell-high approach embedded in their rebalancing. For each holding in PRF\u2019s portfolio, I pulled its price/book, price/sales, and dividend yield before and after the rebalance to approximate the metrics PRF uses to select and weight stocks. I split the portfolio into two cohorts based on whether a holding\u2019s weighting increased or decreased and compared their characteristics after controlling for how much each stock\u2019s weighting changed. Stocks whose weightings increased at the rebalance were cheaper relative to their fundamental metrics, like book value or sales, while the opposite was true for holdings whose weightings decreased. Exhibit 2 demonstrates the weighted average characteristics of stocks with increased weightings versus those that were trimmed down, as well as the before and after characteristics of PRF\u2019s portfolio. While reweighting pushed the portfolio toward cheaper stocks, the opposite was true of positions that entered or exited the fund. Stocks entering the top 1,000 US companies by fundamental size had healthier fundamentals than those departing. This distinguishes PRF from a market-cap-weighted value index fund like IWD. PRF\u2019s contrarian strategy occurs in the reweighting of holdings, while IWD\u2019s contrarianism stems from stocks moving in and out of its portfolio altogether. Well-performing stocks in IWD graduate to iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF IWF, as Meta Platforms META did in 2023. PRF merely trims back any names that increase their price multiples. PRF cut Meta\u2019s weighting to 0.92% from 2.13% at its last rebalance in March 2024. Likewise, PRF doesn\u2019t flinch when valuations drop. PRF increased its stake in Microsoft after a disappointing 28% decline in 2022. Microsoft went on to rally and returned 58 percentage points in 2023. In contrast, IWD hasn\u2019t owned Microsoft shares since the end of June 2019. IWD tethers its portfolio to the value half of the market, but that isn\u2019t the case for PRF. Growth stocks improving their fundamentals increase their long-term weighting in PRF, even if their weightings are trimmed back when their prices balloon. PRF can take on a growth bias compared with large-value peers when growth stocks\u2019 fundamentals outstrip those of value stocks. But its value tilt can also sharpen when top-performing stocks are built on future growth, not fundamentals. As of April 30, Nvidia made up just 0.17% of PRF\u2019s portfolio despite being the third-largest holding in the Russell 1000 Index. But PRF heavily overweighted fundamentally stronger mavens in the index\u2019s top 10 holdings: Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co JPM. Holding growthier companies adds a quality tilt to PRF that should temper some of the risks of value traps and shore up the portfolio\u2019s durability. Exhibit 3 illustrates PRF\u2019s consistently higher profitability, as measured by return on invested capital, over IWD. Investors intuitively group fundamentally weighted ETFs with conventional value ETFs because they live on the same block of the Morningstar Style Box. However, unpacking their portfolios and rebalancing techniques paints a picture of two divergent philosophies. IWD buys only cheap stocks. PRF buys everything, but it sizes its bets according to the fundamentals of the underlying companies instead of price. This way, PRF avoids overpaying for stocks across the value-growth spectrum while still focusing on stocks with cheap valuations and a tilt to quality. Contrarian investing can come with elevated volatility and the possibility of underperforming the market for a significant period. Understanding how contrarian ETFs work, especially when they reshuffle their portfolios, can keep investors grounded when markets go against them so they can reap the rewards when their contrarian bets deliver."

        "body": "The holy grail of investments is one with a risk premium that is uncorrelated with the economic cycle risks associated with traditional stocks and bonds. (Stock market crashes don\u2019t cause earthquakes, hurricanes, or other natural disasters, and natural disasters tend not to cause bear markets, either in stocks or bonds.) Catastrophe bonds\u2014commonly called cat bonds\u2014fit that profile, providing diversification benefits with the potential for higher risk-adjusted returns with lower volatility. Cat bonds are income instruments typically structured as floating-rate, principal-at-risk notes. Common sizes range from $50 million to $500 million, although the market has at times supported deals as large as $1 billion to $2 billion. Maturity tends to be in the one- to five-year range, with three to four years being the norm. Bond proceeds are commonly held in a dedicated collateral account within a special-purpose reinsurance vehicle, which protects counterparties from credit risk\u2014the risk is the insurance risk from predefined catastrophes. Typically, the terms of the bond will allow the collateral to be invested in government-backed debt or other highly rated and highly liquid debt instruments. Market convention since the global financial crisis is to invest the collateral in US T-bill money market funds or floating-rate IBRD (World Bank) debt. The investors receive quarterly or monthly coupons for the term of the bond, made up of the return on the collateral plus the risk premium paid by the insurance company counterparty to transfer the risk. An open-end mutual fund focused on cat bonds (such as Stone Ridge High Yield Reinsurance Risk Premium SHRIX, Ambassador EMPIX, and Pioneer Cat Bond CBYYX) invests in the liquid subset of the insurance-linked securities market (which includes quota share agreements generally found in interval funds that provide only quarterly liquidity). The more liquid subset of the asset class in a mutual fund structure offers an opportunity for investors who prefer daily liquidity. Catastrophe bonds may cover specific or multiple perils in one or more locations. Coverage can be based on several different event definitions, such as \u201cper occurrence\u201d losses (exposure to a single event), \u201cannual aggregate\u201d losses (exposure to multiple events over the course of a year), or \u201cfrequency\u201d losses (exposure once a specific second or third event has occurred within a defined risk period). Should any of the predefined events occur, assets are liquidated from the collateral account and paid to the sponsor to cover the insured loss claims, and coupon payments are reduced or ceased. Most cat bonds do not have a binary trigger for the loss of principal. This means that bonds may be only partially impaired if an event occurs. Each bond has an attachment point (the loss amount which, when exceeded, triggers a payout from the bondholder) and an exhaustion point (the maximum loss amount for which the bondholder is liable). Most cat bonds come with an \u201cextension period,\u201d which the sponsor can use to extend the maturity of the bond when a qualifying event has occurred but the ultimate loss is not yet known. This allows time to receive third-party loss estimates or collect claims and calculate the final balance sheet impact. How quickly this process can be undertaken depends on the type and structure of the bond: It can be as long as three or four years but is typically quicker. An extension spread is paid over this period. Finally, at maturity, or following the extension period, the investor receives the principal remaining in the collateral account net of any payouts to the sponsor. The cat bond market covers a wide range of defined perils. While this includes several non-natural perils, such as mortgage insurance risk, aviation, marine, extreme mortality, life, healthcare, and terrorist attacks, the majority cover damage from natural catastrophes. This includes windstorms, earthquakes, flooding, and wildfires. US wind-related risk represents a large proportion of the risk transferred into the cat bond market because US hurricane and earthquake exposure is the biggest risk on the insurance industry\u2019s balance sheet. Regionally, Japan and Europe have the most coverage after North America. Cat bonds offer attractive potential risk-adjusted returns. Cat bond indexes have demonstrated annual positive returns in 21 of the past 22 years. The table below shows returns of the Swiss Re Global Catastrophe Bond Total Return Index, a noninvestable index of all natural catastrophe bonds in the market. The annualized return over the period was 6.7% (a premium over one-month Treasury bills of 5.4 percentage points), and the standard deviation of returns was just 5%. That combination produced a Sharpe ratio of 1.16, virtually double that of the Sharpe ratio of the Vanguard S&P 500 Index VFIAX of 0.49. Note that the strongest returns came after periods of weak returns caused by some significant natural disasters. The poor returns led to higher premiums and tighter underwriting standards (including larger deductibles). Cat bonds are outcome-oriented investments that have had low correlation to US equities, commodities, investment-grade bonds, and high-yield bonds, as their returns are driven mostly by nonfinancial events. The diversification benefits can be seen in hypothetical portfolios combining cat bonds with an investment in the S&P 500 index. The table below shows the returns to the S&P 500 as well as the Swiss Re Global Catastrophe Global Bond Total Return Index. Portfolio 1 is a hypothetical allocation of 95% S&P 500 and 5% Swiss Re, and Portfolio 2 is 90% S&P 500 and 10% Swiss Re. Annual rebalancing was assumed. Note the improvement in the Sharpe ratio with the addition of the allocations to cat bonds. Cat bonds\u2019 returns are negatively skewed, as positive returns are limited by the size of the premium and the interest on collateral, while losses could be as large as 100%. Cat bonds have provided investors with strong diversification benefits while providing equitylike returns (a risk premium of 5.4%), with volatility that has been less than one third that of equities. The result has been attractive risk-adjusted returns. Investors willing to accept the left tail risk associated with catastrophe risk should find cat bonds an attractive diversifier to the risks of traditional stock and bond portfolios. With that said, it is worth noting that, for investors willing and able to forgo the daily liquidity provided by cat bonds, there is a more financially rewarding alternative in funds that provide exposure to quota shares as well as cat bonds. Quota shares are risk-sharing agreements with reinsurers that can be held in interval funds that provide limited quarterly liquidity\u2014typically a minimum of 5% a quarter. Given that investors prefer liquid assets, illiquid assets come with significant risk premiums. In addition, the interval fund is more diversified geographically and includes more perils. On the other hand, because it tends to have contracts that are less \u201cout of the money\u201d (it has lower deductibles), while the interval fund\u2019s expected returns are higher, its risks are also higher. Thus, while the interval fund\u2019s expected returns are higher, its risks are also higher."

        "body": "Bond funds\u2019 ability to make money when falling yields lead to higher prices for their bonds was on full display in late 2023. After the yield on the benchmark US Treasury 10-year note briefly touched 5.0% intraday on Oct. 19, the Morningstar US Core Bond Index surged 9% over the next 50 trading days to close out the year as the 10-year Treasury yield fell about 110 basis points. With yields ticking back up in 2024\u2019s first half, investors may want to consider funds poised to benefit from another drop in yields as well as those that tend to flourish in other types of bond market rallies, such as when the market rewards credit risk. The upside/downside capture ratio can help investors assess a fund\u2019s likelihood to outperform in bond market rallies as well as its ability to preserve capital in downturns. The upside portion shows the degree to which a fund has gained more than an index in a particular period. For example, if the Morningstar US Core Bond Index returns 5% in a given calendar year, a fund that returns 6% will have gained 1.2 times the index and have an upside capture ratio of 120%. Conversely, a fund that loses 6% versus a 5% drop for the index would have a downside capture ratio of 120% for that calendar year. Whether a fund assumes more interest-rate risk (longer duration) or achieves higher returns through a yield advantage versus the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, these three funds are solid long-term performers and feature high upside capture ratios relative to their downside protection. BlackRock fixed-income CIO Rick Rieder leads the team that manages BlackRock Total Return MDHQX, which has a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold. This intermediate core-plus bond Morningstar Category offering blends top-down and bottom-up elements, and it typically dips into below-investment-grade and emerging-markets debt to take more credit risk than its Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. The yield advantage of these sectors has helped it outperform in rallies. The fund doesn\u2019t take as much duration risk as some peers, yet it still managed to capture 111% of the benchmark\u2019s upside over the past five years, versus a downside capture ratio of 109% over the same period. Silver-rated PGIM Total Return Bond PDBAX blends longer duration and a yield advantage to achieve its upside potential. This intermediate core-plus bond fund\u2019s bias toward corporate bonds and securitized assets helps it outyield its typical peer. In addition, the fund\u2019s duration tends to be longer than that of most rivals, which helps its upside capture ratio. Over the past five- and 10-year periods, the fund\u2019s 120% upside capture helped it beat the benchmark in rallies, while its downside capture ratio was about 116%. Its average 6.6-year duration was longer than the index\u2019s, while its 4.6% trailing 12-month yield was more than 120 basis points ahead of the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index\u2019s VBTLX, a representative passive competitor. Bronze-rated Western Asset Core Bond WATFX, an intermediate core bond fund, captures more upside than peers through its longer-duration bias versus most rivals. The fund\u2019s 7.2-year average duration over the past three years was about 1.25 and 0.75 years longer than that of its typical peer and benchmark, respectively. The fund\u2019s 10-year 118% upside capture ratio is one of the category\u2019s highest. When long-term yields fell in 2019, for example, this fund\u2019s 10.6% gain was about 1.9 percentage points better than the index\u2019s. However, this upside potential comes with a bumpier ride; the strategy\u2019s downside capture ratio was 119%, while its standard deviation, a measure of volatility, was also among the category\u2019s highest.

        "body": "While recent interest-rate increases tank bond prices, they also create juicier starting yields, increasing expected prospective returns. That sounds like a good thing, but where should investors start? Options abound for those looking to branch outside of traditional core bond allocations. Three such specialty allocations are bank loans, high-yield bonds, and corporate bonds. Funds in these categories can complement a diversified portfolio, but it\u2019s important to remain cognizant of their unique purposes and risks. As has been the case across all fixed income, yields in these categories have shot up in recent years. Most bank loans are rated below investment-grade, but they offer decent yields and protection against rising rates. The asset class\u2019 credit risk and inherent illiquidity were apparent in the depths of the coronavirus panic from Feb. 20, 2020, to March 23, 2020, when the average loan fund lost 19.7%. That was in line with the average high-yield bond fund\u2019s 20.0% loss and among the harshest across fixed-income categories. But loans shone as the Federal Reserve hiked rates from 2022-23; the average bank-loan fund\u2019s 2.6% loss in 2022 was much less than the average corporate-bond fund\u2019s 15.2% loss, owing to the latter\u2019s greater rate sensitivity. Fidelity Floating Rate High Income\u2019s FFRHX scale and research depth make it among the category\u2019s most compelling options. At over $13 billion, it is by far the category\u2019s largest strategy, and it also has strong relationships with private equity sponsors that give it access to harder-to-source deals. The fund yielded 8.7% as of March 2024, as measured by SEC yield, which estimates the average current yield of all bonds within a given fund\u2019s portfolio. High-yield bond funds had the highest correlation with equities of any fixed-income Morningstar Category over the trailing 10 years through April 2024. While that spelled trouble during 2020\u2032s covid selloff, the category bounced back better than bank loans on its way to posting a 4.8% gain for that year, middle-of-the-pack relative to other fixed-income categories. With a shorter-than-average duration, funds in this category can offer some meaningful protection from rate changes. The average high-yield bond fund\u2019s 11.8% return in 2023 trailed only bank loans as the best in fixed income. PGIM High Yield\u2019s PBHAX breadth and depth of leveraged finance research set it apart from competitors. The strategy benefits from the firm\u2019s ample resources, too, including an impressive proprietary risk-management system that closely monitors tracking-error budgets. That helps make returns relatively predictable for the fundamental-focused strategy that eschews equities, convertibles, and non-US currencies. The fund yielded 7.3% as of March 2024. While corporate-bond funds are correlated with equities, they tend to take on less credit risk and more interest-rate risk than their respective bank-loan and high-yield bond fund counterparts. Indeed, the category average\u2019s 12.5% loss from Feb. 20, 2020, to March 23, 2020, was more than 7 percentage points less than the bank-loan and high-yield bond category averages. But its average effective duration is typically around 7.0 years, more than twice that of the average high-yield bond fund. That contributed to corporate bond-funds lagging high-yield bond funds in the first quarters of 2021 and 2022 by about 5 and 3 percentage points, respectively. Pimco Investment Grade Credit Bond\u2019s PIGIX strong leadership and resourcefulness continue to make it one of the category\u2019s best funds. The strategy\u2019s more recent track record isn\u2019t as strong as its longer-term one, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the approach\u2019s appeal. Lead manager Mark Kiesel and company regularly explore out-of-index sectors, such as high-yield, corporate, emerging-markets debt, and securitized fare, to add value. The group\u2019s strong credit-picking capabilities make it a good bet to outperform over the long term. The fund yielded 5.2% as of March 2024. While all three of the above categories are typically among the highest-yielding in the asset class, they are also more strongly correlated to equities. The latter point is especially important given that investors often use fixed income as a ballast and volatility damper in portfolios. Be sure to look beyond gaudy yields, and carefully weigh each category\u2019s unique risk/return trade-offs. This article first appeared in the April 2024 issue of Morningstar FundInvestor.

        "body": "Susan Dziubinski: And then pivoting over to bonds, how should investors be thinking about the duration of their fixed-income positions heading into the second quarter given Morningstar\u2019s outlook for interest rates? David Sekera: The bond market has continued to struggle thus far this year. So, the Morningstar US Core Bond Index\u2014and, again, that\u2019s our proxy for the full overall fixed-income market\u2014that\u2019s down a little bit under 1% year to date. Essentially what\u2019s happened here is that we have seen long-term bond interest rates rise. And, of course, as interest rates go up, that pushes the bond prices down, and that more than offset that underlying yield carry that you generate on bonds. But based on our interest-rate forecast, I do think investors are still best served in what I call longer-duration bonds. That five- to seven-year, even out to that 10-year duration, I think looks pretty attractive. I think at this point you can lock in kind of the currently higher interest rates that we see. When I look at the yield curve, we do project in the short term that the federal-funds rate yield will fall over the course of the second half of this year, getting down to 4.00% to 4.25% by the end of the year. But we expect that to fall even further next year in 2025, getting down to a 2.50% to 2.75% range. So, you are getting very high yields today in the short term, but I do think that those yields will start going down over time. Now, in the longer end of the curve, our economics team does project that the yield on the US Treasury of the 10-year will average 4% this year, so that does mean that will be going down in the second half of this year. But then the US economic team does look for that still to fall further in 2025, averaging 3% next year. Dziubinski: Dave, within fixed income, what\u2019s your take today on government bonds versus high-quality corporate bonds versus junk bonds? Sekera: Well, at this point, I think investors are going to be better served overweighting US Treasuries in that fixed-income portion of their portfolio. Again, our base case is still looking for that soft landing for the economy. But when I look at the corporate bond market, I would say credit spreads there have tightened to the point where I no longer think you\u2019re really getting adequately compensated for the added risk of defaults and downgrades. When we ran our numbers for this most recent outlook, the average credit spread of the Morningstar US Corporate Bond Index, which is our proxy for investment-grade bonds, was only 86 basis points over Treasuries. And then the high-yield index, that average spread was only a little over 300 basis points. So, a lot of people may not understand what that means. By way of comparison, I would just say that at the beginning of this year in our 2024 outlook, we had moved to a market weight in corporate bonds. The investment-grade spread at that point was 98 basis points and the high yield spread was 338. And at the end of 2022, when we had recommended an overweight in corporate bonds, the average spread for investment-grade was 130, and the average spread for high yield was 457. When I look at corporate bonds and I look at credit spreads since 2000, so over the past 24 years, when I look at how credit spreads and how tight they are today compared to that time frame, I think only 2% to 3% of the time have credit spreads traded at tighter levels than what we see today.

        "body": "JPMorgan Core Bond\u2019s JCBUX deep resources, as exemplified by a smooth recent manager transition and the 2023 addition of securitized bond specialist Andy Melchiorre and rates expert Edward Fitzpatrick to the manager roster, prompted a March 2024 upgrade of the fund\u2019s People Pillar rating to High from Above Average. Increased confidence in the team\u2019s bottom-up security-selection process and its focus on higher-rated fare also drove an upgrade of its Process rating to High from Above Average. As a result, the Morningstar Medalist Rating of its cheapest share class rose to Gold from Silver. Melchiorre and Fitzpatrick joined an already-proven manager roster. Lead manager Rick Figuly has steered the fund to strong risk-adjusted returns since September 2015, and Justin Rucker joined him as comanager in March 2019. True, fixed-income CIO Steve Lear was a comanager of this fund when he left the firm in March 2024, but he wasn\u2019t involved in the day-to-day management of the strategy. Lear also telegraphed his plans to retire nine months in advance, which allowed the firm to bolster the roster with Melchiorre and Fitzpatrick. The team\u2019s approach to portfolio construction is cautious and appealing. The team limits credit risk by only purchasing investment-grade securities, and it avoids big interest-rate bets versus the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. The team often adds value by focusing on various forms of securitized debt, investing in structures with positive convexity (those that will gain more when rates decline than they will lose when rates rise). As a result of this strategy, the fund has typically held up well when credit suffers or interest rates jump. Key Morningstar Metrics for JPMorgan Core Bond Morningstar Medalist Rating: Gold Process Pillar: High People Pillar: High Parent Pillar: Above Average The team that manages Guggenheim Core Bond Fund GIUSX, Guggenheim Limited Duration GIKRX, Guggenheim Macro Opportunities GIOSX, and Guggenheim Total Return Bond GIBRX earned an upgrade of its People rating to High from Above Average. As a result, the Morningstar Medalist Rating of the cheapest share classes of each of the four funds rose to Silver (from Bronze in each case except for Limited Duration, which had been rated Neutral). The team suffered a substantial, unexpected loss when CIO Scott Minerd died in late 2022. But he had set up the team for success through savvy hires. New CIO Anne Walsh, a longtime manager on three of the four portfolios, named veteran manager Steven Brown the new fixed-income CIO. As of January 2023, Adam Bloch and Evan Serdensky were named comanagers on all the funds. And the managers are backed by a 50-strong corporate credit team as well as dedicated groups specializing in macro, interest rates, and structured credit. The team also makes good use of its resources, allowing separate groups to make decisions in their areas of expertise and avoiding quick, rash calls. Thus, the team should be able to continue to execute well across these four distinctive mandates. Key Morningstar Metrics for Guggenheim Core Bond, Limited Duration, Macro Opportunities, and Total Return Bond Morningstar Medalist Rating: Silver Process Pillar: Above Average People Pillar: High Parent Pillar: Average An overly complex approach erodes our confidence in JHancock Multimanager Lifetime target-date series, meriting a downgrade of its Process rating to Below Average from Average. The cheapest share classes of the series continue to earn a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Neutral, though three other share classes were downgraded to Negative. The team that runs this series, led by multi-asset CIO Nathan Thooft and US head of asset allocation Robert Sykes, remains adequate. But the series features too many moving parts. Strategic allocations are determined by the team\u2019s five-year asset-class forecasts, and allocations can shift significantly if the forecasts do. The team can also make tactical shifts based on its 12-18-month macro views. These moves are made by adjusting the weightings of the underlying funds\u2014a sprawling lineup, even after some streamlining, of 26\u201333 portfolios depending on the fund within the series. However, two of the series\u2019 largest holdings, JHancock US Sector Rotation NAV and International Strategic Equity Allocation NAV, make tactical shifts of their own, which may neutralize or exaggerate tilts implemented by the target-date team. Furthermore, those two funds have struggled to add value in recent years.

        "body": "Fiduciary financial advisors have reason to celebrate a long-awaited change in the financial landscape. New regulations from the US Department of Labor extend fiduciary protections to IRAs, effective Sept. 23. This means even advisors who are not registered investment advisors must put their clients\u2019 interests first when it comes to IRAs. With more and more baby boomers retiring, there has been a huge flow of 401(k) rollovers into IRAs. This has presented a tremendous opportunity for advisors but has also opened the door for nonfiduciary advisors (like stockbrokers and insurance agents) to generate unreasonable commissions. Until now, a gap existed in the protective regulations affecting individuals rolling their hard-earned retirement funds into IRAs. Although all advisors had to act in clients\u2019 best interest for 401(k)s, only RIAs were held to Erisa\u2019s fiduciary standard on IRAs (and other investment accounts). The new regulations require all advisors on IRAs to act in the best interest of their clients, not their own wallets. Here\u2019s what this means for you and your clients: Are these regulations necessary? In my opinion, yes. For example, I was alerted to an inappropriate recommendation made to a friend just two weeks ago! My friend just retired, and her $1 million 401(k) was being rolled into an IRA. Her \u201cadvisor\u201d recommended an immediate annuity paying out 5.5% a year for the rest of her life \u201cto ensure she doesn\u2019t run out of money.\u201d I asked my friend if she would like to receive $55,000 a year for the rest of her life, with no increases for inflation or for market growth, while giving away her $1 million. She was horrified. She anticipated averaging greater than 5.5% annualized returns. This meant she could draw at least $55,000 a year without giving up her principal! Yet, absent talking to me, she would have gone along with her advisor\u2019s suggestion. Had these new regulations been in place, my friend would not have had to face this potentially harmful advice. Although these regulations should be universally applauded, some in the industry have expressed concerns. At a minimum, even RIA firms will be faced with increased compliance requirements. All firms need to adjust internal processes and implement new training programs. Of course, these changes will be much more cumbersome for non-RIA firms. Some advisors\u2014especially those who are commission based\u2014claim these changes could reduce the number of advisors willing to work with smaller accounts. It\u2019s true that change typically causes some degree of discomfort. But the ultimate goal is worth the pain: protecting clients\u2019 retirement dreams. Here\u2019s how advisors can navigate this change and even leverage it to their advantage: As they say, a rising tide lifts all boats. By embracing these regulations, we can help our clients build stronger retirement plans while uplifting the reputation and trust in our industry."

        "body": "I recently presented a webinar to Morningstar\u2019s women employees to help with their finances. I focused on insurance, taxes, and saving for retirement. The participants were enthusiastic about the information, and I got a number of great questions. I\u2019d like to share them with you, along with my answers. And remember, you don\u2019t need to be a woman to benefit from increasing your financial knowledge! In Part 1, I\u2019ll address the insurance and tax questions. Stay tuned for Part 2 on retirement saving. Q: Regarding health insurance, do you have any tips for deciding whether to keep your employee plan or switch to your partner\u2019s after getting married? A: This is a great question that does not come with a simple answer. Here are the factors to consider. Financial: Practical: Once you have evaluated all of these factors, you can make a good choice for your health insurance. Q: I\u2019m in the first year after getting married. Is it always advantageous to file jointly? Does it matter if you were only married part of the year? A: It\u2019s not always advantageous for married couples to file jointly. The best way to find out is to actually calculate your total tax both ways\u2014filing jointly or filing separately. Note that your marital status for tax purposes is determined at the end of the year. If you are married on Dec. 31, the IRS treats you as married all year. So, your filing options for your first year of marriage are married filing jointly or married filing separately. You cannot file as single or head of household. In most cases, it will be advantageous to file jointly. Joint tax brackets are broader than single tax brackets, so it\u2019s likely joint tax will be lower than the total tax for each of you filing separately. Additionally, filing jointly allows you to combine deductions and credits as well as claim a higher standard deduction than for single filers. At times, it could be beneficial to file separately. For example, if one spouse has significantly higher income (and it won\u2019t be considered \u201ccommunity\u201d earnings), filing separately might avoid pushing the higher earning spouse into a higher tax bracket. Another time filing separately could be best is when one spouse has student loan interest or high medical expenses. Filing separately could allow these deductions by avoiding percentage limitations imposed by filing jointly. Again, the best way to choose how to file is to do the calculations both ways. Tax software can help; better yet, consult with a tax professional. Q: What kind of tax applies if one buys stock right after they sell it? A: I believe you are asking about the wash-sale rule. This rule only applies if the sale resulted in a loss. If you sell stock at a gain and then buy it back within 30 days, you\u2019ll pay tax on the gain, and the new stock you bought will have a higher cost basis (equal to what you paid). If you sell stock at a loss and replace it within 30 days, the IRS won\u2019t let you take the write-off on your tax return, and your cost basis for the new shares will be increased by the amount of the loss. To get around this rule, either wait 31 days to repurchase the stock or, if you really want to buy back right away, choose something similar that\u2019s not identical. For example, if you sold Ford F, you might buy General Motors GM. If you sold a large-cap index fund, buy an actively managed large-cap fund or a large-cap growth index fund. Q: Are there any dependent deductions if you are caring for aging parents or an adult child who is either a student or disabled? A: Yes, you can potentially claim dependent tax benefits for all of these situations. You can claim an elderly parent as a dependent if you meet the following requirements: You can claim your adult child as a dependent if they are a qualified student or permanently disabled. To claim an adult child who is a student, the following requirements must be met: There is no age limit for claiming a disabled adult child as a dependent. To receive tax benefits, these requirements must be met: As with an elderly parent, to the extent adult daycare or in-home care is needed for your disabled child (and you work), you could qualify for additional credits. Please know that this is a general summary of the rules, which are actually quite complex. I recommend consulting with a qualified tax professional to determine how these rules apply to you. Q: We plan to donate less than $1,000 this year. Do we need to document the contributions even though we\u2019ll likely be claiming the standard deduction? A: No, it\u2019s not necessary to document your donations under $1,000 if you plan to claim the standard deduction on your taxes. But before assuming you\u2019ll be taking the standard deduction, be sure to add up all your potential deductions. You\u2019ll need to include your charitable contributions, deductible mortgage interest, state and property taxes (up to $10,000 per year) and medical expenses greater than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. If that total is more than the standard deduction, you\u2019ll want to itemize\u2014and document those contributions. For 2024, the standard deduction is $14,600 for single filers and $29,200 for married couples. If all the rules seem complicated, they are! Consulting a professional is a good idea to help in sorting through them all."

        "body": "Retirement is supposed to be about spending time with grandchildren, traveling, and winning the local pickleball league, not worrying about running out of money. But one of the most challenging parts of retiring is the transition from living off paychecks to paying yourself. That seismic shift means the average retiree faces numerous unknowns, a slew of psychological obstacles to maneuver, and, on top of all that, math. And, as current savings and spending patterns show, retirees need help making these monumental decisions. The number of retirees who need help navigating their income is also set to skyrocket over the next several years. One estimate from the Alliance for Lifetime Income, a nonprofit educational organization, suggests that more than 4 million people in the US will hit the retirement age of 65 every year through 2027. BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink is optimistic that the firm\u2019s newly launched BlackRock LifePath Paycheck target-date series, which includes an annuity as part of the glide path, can be the solution retirees are looking for. Below, we explore how we got here with a brief, and imperfect, history of retirement-income solutions. No rule says you have to get help when developing a retirement-income strategy. But just like there\u2019s no rule that says you can\u2019t have ice cream for every meal, there may be some discomfort associated with going solo. (Astute readers will note the risk of outliving your retirement savings is a relatively new problem.) In exchange for a lump sum of money, an annuity contract guarantees you regular income until you die (provided the other side of the contract doesn\u2019t go bankrupt first). These types of contracts have been around since Ancient Egypt, but they didn\u2019t become popular in the US until the 1930s when the Great Depression drove people to look for some insurance against running out of money. Since then, the types of annuities have multiplied\u2014and so has their complexity. Breaking down income annuities and savings annuities. Six picks that earn a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold. Our annual study suggests that new retirees can spend more from their portfolios. John Rekenthaler on the ins and outs of calculating your retirement payouts. Pensions, or defined-benefit plans, gave workers the peace of mind that they would have a regular income stream in retirement provided by their employers. It\u2019s a great deal for workers, but for companies, it\u2019s much easier to transfer that responsibility to the individual. Pensions have been gradually disappearing and being replaced by defined-contribution plans, where the amount to save and where to invest are left to the individual. Social Security remains a valuable source of retirement income, especially if you have the wherewithal to delay your benefits until age 70. But for most people, Social Security will only replace a percentage of their salary in retirement, so they still need some supplemental savings to cover the rest, plus other goals like leaving money behind for heirs. Defined-contribution plans were born out of corporations\u2019 desire to no longer provide pension benefits. Although they don\u2019t offer the same guarantees as a pension plan, defined-contribution plan features, like auto-enrollment and auto-escalation, help investors along the way to retirement. For many, their investments in these plans are their entire retirement savings. Target-date strategies aren\u2019t specifically designed to deliver income in retirement, but they are the most popular default investment option in defined-contribution plans. These strategies offer a hands-off solution for investors that automatically allocates contributions to a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. The allocation is aggressive but gradually becomes more conservative as it nears the retirement date, and some continue to lower the percentage of equities for longer. The passage of the Secure Act in 2019 reduced the fiduciary liabilities for a defined-contribution plan sponsor that offers annuities for its participants. This opened the door to the dozen or so target-date series with an annuity component that have launched since. Although these strategies show promise, it\u2019s still too early to tell if they truly offer an evolution for retirement income or are as fleeting as the benefits of eating ice cream for every meal."

        "body": "Hiring slowed significantly in the United States in July, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will act more aggressively to lower interest rates this year to support the economy, now that inflation pressures have eased. While economists say the report painted the clearest picture yet of a cooling economy, the extent of the job growth slowdown it showed may have been exaggerated. \u201cMarkets are probably overreacting to today\u2019s jobs data,\u201d says Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar. \u201cBut make no mistake, it is bearish news\u201d for the economy. The US economy added 114,000 jobs in July, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was well below the increase of 175,000 economists had predicted for the month. The report also revised down previous estimates for new job creation in June and May. In addition, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% from 4.1% in June. Economists had forecast the rate would remain steady at 4.1%. \u201cThe jump in unemployment is signaling an alarm that the US could enter a recession,\u201d Caldwell says. \u201cOther data conflicts with this, but job growth is slowing by any measure.\u201d  In the wake of the report, traders in the bond futures market rapidly shifted expectations for the Fed\u2019s September policy-making meeting. Going into Friday\u2019s release, traders had considered a quarter-point interest rate cut a near certainty. However, the bond market now suggests the central bank will lower its target rate range more aggressively, cutting it by half a percentage point from the current range of 5.25%-5.50%. The jump in the unemployment rate drew particular attention, having broken out of a long-held range of roughly 3.7%-3.9%, coming in at 4.3%. This is a flag for the \u201cSahm Rule,\u201d which observes that the US economy has always fallen into a recession after the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate has risen more than half a percentage point within a 12-month period. With the latest report, the unemployment rate has averaged 4.1% in the past three months, up 0.5 percentage points from August 2023. \u201cThe Sahm Rule has never failed, but given the small sample size of US recessions, this is far less impressive than it might seem,\u201d explains Caldwell. \u201cThere are orders of magnitude more data points (and ways to slice and dice the data) than there are recessions in the historical data, so it\u2019s not surprising that something like the Sahm Rule has a perfect track record. Many such rules would be expected to exist just by random chance.\u201d However, he thinks there is an important aspect of the rule for investors to consider: \u201cOnce the unemployment rate gets moving upward, it\u2019s very likely to continue rising. Rising unemployment is part of a vicious process of economic contraction. People being unemployed leads to less spending, which causes firms to cut back and unemployment to increase more.\u201d At the same time, Caldwell offers some qualifiers around the perception of the jobs report, particularly the continuing difference in what its two main portions depict. The unemployment rate comes from a survey of households, while payrolls are derived from a survey of businesses. \u201cThe household survey reports total employment being down 0.1% year over year. This conflicts sharply with the establishment survey\u2019s nonfarm payroll employment, which is up 1.6% year over year,\u201d he notes. \u201cThe idea that employment has shown zero increase over the past year also conflicts with every other piece of economic data we have.\u201d Not only that, but \u201clabor markets typically slow down only after economic activity slows, but GDP growth has remained strong,\u201d so \u201cthe timing also doesn\u2019t make sense. Not to mention, survey response rates for the household survey have dwindled in recent years. All of this suggests that we should take the reported jump in unemployment quite seriously, but not panic.\u201d Some economists had anticipated that Hurricane Beryl could dampen the hiring numbers, but the BLS said this was not the case. On the payroll side, the BLS reported continued increases in hiring in healthcare, transportation and warehousing, and construction. Information employment declined. \u201cNonfarm payroll employment data itself has shown a bit more reason for worry recently,\u201d Caldwell says. \u201cIt\u2019s decreased to a 1.3% annualized growth rate in the past three months, down from 2.1% as of March 2024. But 1.3% is still a solid growth rate.\u201d Bond and stock markets reacted strongly to the report, with equities sliding and bonds staging a strong rally. The yield on the US Treasury 10-year note has fallen to 3.83% from roughly 4.15% on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s an astonishingly large move.\u201d Not only is the market now expecting a more aggressive rate cut in September, but the Fed is also seen continuing to cut rates in November and December, taking the funds rate down to a target range of 4.00%-4.25% by the end of the year\u2014a full 1.25 percentage points lower. \u201cConfirmatory data from other indicators that the economy is weakening could lead to a 50-basis point cut,\u201d Caldwell says. However, \u201cwe disagree with a 50-basis points cut being the base case for September for now, as is being priced into markets. Nonetheless, it\u2019s time for the Fed to cut the federal-funds rate ... The data quality issues make our picture of the economy somewhat murky, but there\u2019s enough risk to call for substantially cutting rates now. Rate cuts in each of the final three meetings this year, beginning in September, is the base case if the unemployment rate does not fall back.\u201d"

        "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell isn\u2019t ready to commit to a September interest rate cut, but it\u2019s all but certain if good inflation continues to roll in. As widely expected, the central bank kept the federal-funds rate target range unchanged at 5.25%-5.50% at its July meeting. A few observers had argued in favor of a July rate cut, and Powell acknowledged a serious discussion in the FOMC on the merits of such a move at the meeting. However, the judgment was overwhelmingly in favor of keeping rates unchanged. The attention today centered on the Fed\u2019s next steps. In the past, the central bank has used \u201cforward guidance\u201d as a tool in monetary policy, seeking to actively shape the market\u2019s expectations of the future path of the federal-funds rate. For example, the Fed made it clear in the spring of 2022 that massive interest rate increases were on the way. This caused bond yields to rise, which effectively frontloaded the monetary policy tightening. But since the middle of 2023, when the Fed ended its rate hiking, Powell and the Fed have been somewhat reticent on future policy decisions. Instead, the mantra has been \u201cdata dependence\u201d and \u201cmeeting-by-meeting\u201d decision-making. The Fed does issue quarterly projections of the federal-funds rate from FOMC members, but these are tentative forecasts and not commitments.  With that in mind, the Fed\u2019s latest commentary is probably the clearest forthcoming signal that it\u2019s likely to cut in September. This meeting\u2019s official statement included new language that \u201cthe committee is attentive to the risk to both sides of its dual mandate,\u201d whereas prior statements focused on \u201cinflation risks.\u201d Perhaps most importantly, markets now assign a near-100% probability of a rate cut in September, according to CME FedWatch. Powell made no attempt to gainsay such predictions. Of course, market projections are contingent on a belief that fairly benign inflation data will continue to roll in. Powell said that further confidence that inflation is returning to the Fed\u2019s 2% target will be needed before cutting rates, but that the \u201csecond quarter\u2019s data has added to our confidence\u201d and \u201cmore good data would further strengthen that confidence.\u201d FOMC projections from the June meeting called for one rate cut by year-end 2024 if the core PCE inflation rate reached 2.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, consensus projections are for core PCE inflation at 2.7% by then, and Morningstar\u2019s forecast is 2.5%. On the flip side, the labor market may be weakening faster than the Fed anticipated. The Fed had projected unemployment to reach 4.0% at the end of 2024, but it\u2019s already at 4.1% as of June. All this calls for more than one rate cut by the end of 2024, meaning the Fed will most likely need to get started by September. Markets are now projecting three cuts in 2024, taking the federal-funds rate down to 4.50%-4.75% by December. Markets expect a further four cuts in 2025, taking the rate down to 3.50%-3.75% by the end of the year. These expectations have fallen in recent months, converging closer to Morningstar\u2019s forecast of 3.00%-3.25% for the end of 2025. We expect the federal-funds rate target range to ultimately drop to 1.75%-2.00% by the end of 2026. Our views are driven by expectations that inflation will run slightly below the Fed\u2019s 2% target in 2025 and 2026, while unemployment remains slightly elevated."

        "body": "Alphabet GOOGL/GOOG released its second-quarter earnings report on July 23. Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on Alphabet\u2019s earnings and stock. With its 3-star rating, we believe Alphabet\u2019s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $182 per share, which implies an enterprise value of about 13 times our estimated 2024 adjusted EBITDA, which excludes share-based compensation. We expect advertising revenue to remain over 70% of Alphabet\u2019s total revenue, driven by continuing growth in digital ad spending, albeit at a much slower rate than historically. We model 6.5% ad revenue growth for 2024 due to slower expected economic growth than in 2023. We have estimated total Google ad revenue of $253 billion in 2024 and $272 billion in 2025. We think YouTube will contribute 13.6% of Google\u2019s advertising revenue in 2024, up slightly from 2023, and more than 14% in 2025. YouTube growth should benefit from its impressive reach and usage frequency, plus its video-only content format, which is attractive to brand advertisers. We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market and assume more than 20% annual revenue growth through 2028. Read more about Alphabet\u2019s fair value estimate. We assign Alphabet a wide moat, thanks to durable competitive advantages derived from the company\u2019s intangible assets, as well as its network effect. We believe Alphabet holds significant intangible assets related to overall technological expertise in search algorithms and AI (machine learning and deep learning), as well as access to and accumulation of valuable data for advertisers. We also believe Google\u2019s brand is a significant asset. \u201cGoogle it\u201d has become synonymous with searching, and regardless of actual technological competency, the firm\u2019s search engine is perceived as being the most advanced in the industry. While Microsoft\u2019s MSFT Bing is attempting to dethrone Google with AI technology from OpenAI, we think the firm can defend its dominance in search with its own AI technology, some of which OpenAI\u2019s products are based on. Read more about Alphabet\u2019s economic moat. Alphabet has a strong balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents of $111 billion versus total debt of only $13 billion as of the end of 2023. The company also has a $4 billion revolver with no outstanding balance. Over 60% of the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents are held outside the US. Read more about financial strength. Our Uncertainty Rating for Alphabet is High. While we remain confident that Google will maintain its dominant position in the search market, a long-lasting downturn in online ad spending could harm the firm\u2019s revenue and cash flow. On the other hand, positive returns on Alphabet\u2019s investments in cloud and moonshots could considerably increase our fair value estimate. Although we expect intangible assets and the network effect will help Google retain its position, there are minimal switching costs to using a rival search engine. We think this risk remains manageable. Bing\u2014the nearest competitor and the first mover in enhancing search with generative AI capabilities\u2014currently has far smaller market share and does not have a significant presence in the mobile market, where Alphabet\u2019s Android mobile operating system gives it an advantage. The firm\u2019s high dependence on user behavior data represents an environmental, social, and governance risk. If it fails to maintain adequate data privacy and security, Google\u2019s advertising business would likely suffer and user trust in the company\u2019s other products would likely falter.

        "body": "Coca-Cola KO released its second-quarter earnings report on July 23. Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on Coca-Cola\u2019s earnings and the outlook for its stock. We plan to raise our $60 per share fair value estimate for Coke by a low-single-digit percentage after digesting its strong second-quarter results and updated outlook. However, we view the stock as fully valued even after the planned increase. Organic sales rose 15%, led by innovations, digital initiatives, and deft in-market executions, and adjusted earnings per share were up 7%. This was with a softer consumer backdrop in the US and continued instability and macro challenges across Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Coke remains poised to fuel volume and pricing growth, aided by its total beverage portfolio approach, steadfast investments in product innovation, and brand marketing. We plan to tick up our 2024 sales and adjusted EPS estimates by low-single-digit percentages to align with management\u2019s raised guidance, while our 10-year projection for mid-single-digit sales growth and a low-30s average operating margin remains in place. Read more about Coca-Cola\u2019s fair value estimate. We believe Coke has built a wide moat around its global beverage operations, based on strong intangible assets and a significant cost advantage that will let it deliver excess investment returns above its cost of capital over and beyond the next 20 years. We have modeled the company to generate returns on invested capital, including goodwill, that average 32% throughout our 10-year explicit forecast, comfortably surpassing our estimate of its weighted average cost of capital at 7%. Read more about Coca-Cola\u2019s economic moat. We believe Coke has a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity to weather macroeconomic volatilities and invest for long-term growth. The company had $15.2 billion in cash and short-term investments as of March 2024, $4.2 billion in backup lines of credit for general-purpose use, and a well-established commercial paper program in the US letting it consistently access short-term funding at low rates. Leverage is manageable, with net debt/adjusted EBITDA at 2 times in 2023, within its long-term target of 2-2.5 times. We expect the metric to hold at low levels in the coming years. Read more about Coca-Cola\u2019s financial strength. We assign Coke a Low Uncertainty Rating. We view strong bottler relationships as crucial to its business model and return profile, but in periods of high inflation, these relationships could come under pressure as the bottlers tend to bear the brunt of cost increases. This is less of an issue in the US, where local bottlers are small and have limited bargaining power, but in emerging markets\u2014which hold the key to healthy volume growth\u2014Coca-Cola faces much larger bottlers, such as Arca Continental and Coke Femsa, that are likely in a better position to negotiate. Non-alcoholic beverage demand tends to be resilient through economic cycles, but Coke has high exposure to international markets (over two-thirds of both revenue and profits) that leads to stepped-up volatility within its operations\u2014resulting from shifting macroeconomic and regulatory landscapes, currency fluctuation, and geopolitical risks\u2014compared with domestically focused peers. The international experience of management combined with bottler collaboration globally can help the firm tackle these challenges. Read more about Coca-Cola\u2019s risk and uncertainty."

With its 3-star rating, we believe Tesla\u2019s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $200 per share. We use a weighted average cost of capital of just under 9%. Our equity valuation adds back nonrecourse and non-dilutive convertible debt. We believe Tesla\u2019s deliveries will be slightly higher in 2024 than the 1.81 million in 2023. We anticipate lower average selling prices, as the company will likely have to cut prices in key markets like China, in line with peers. We forecast automotive gross margins will be 19% in 2024, in line with 2023 results. In the longer term, we assume Tesla will deliver nearly 5 million vehicles per year in 2030. This includes fleet sales, an expanding opportunity for the firm. Our forecast is well below management\u2019s aspirational goal of selling 20 million vehicles by the end of this decade. However, it is nearly 3 times the 1.8 million vehicles delivered in 2023. Read more about Tesla\u2019s fair value estimate. We award Tesla a narrow moat based on its intangible assets and cost advantage. The company\u2019s strong brand cachet as a luxury automaker commands premium pricing, while its EV manufacturing expertise lets it make its vehicles more cheaply than competitors. Tesla will face increasing competition in the coming years. Automakers plan to electrify their fleets by adding EV versions of existing vehicles and creating new platforms. However, we see EVs becoming a greater proportion of auto sales, growing to 30% by 2030, up from 3% in 2020, which will expand the market as they rapidly take share from internal combustion engine vehicles. As new models are introduced, Tesla\u2019s technological advantage and the strength of its brand will remain intact, letting it continue to charge premium prices for its EVs. Read more about Tesla\u2019s economic moat. Tesla is in excellent financial health. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments stood at $26.9 billion and far exceeded total debt as of March 31, 2024. Total debt was around $4.8 billion, while total debt excluding vehicle and energy product financing (nonrecourse debt) was a little more than $50 million. Tesla has historically used credit lines, convertible debt financing, and equity offerings to raise capital to fund its growth plans. In 2020, the company raised $12.3 billion in three equity issuances. We think this makes sense, as funding massive growth solely through debt adds additional risk in a cyclical industry. Read more about Tesla\u2019s financial strength. We assign Tesla a Very High Uncertainty Rating, as we see a wide range of potential outcomes for the company. The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic conditions. As the EV market leader, Tesla is vulnerable to growing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants. As new lower-priced EVs enter the market, the firm may be forced to continue to cut prices, reducing its industry-leading profits. With more EV choices, consumers may view Tesla less favorably. The firm is investing heavily in capacity expansions that carry the risk of delays and cost overruns. The company is also investing in R&D to maintain its technological advantage and generate software-based revenue, with no guarantee these investments will bear fruit. Tesla\u2019s CEO effectively owns a little more than 20% of its stock and uses it as collateral for personal loans, which raises the risk of a large sale to repay debt.

        "body": "Disney DIS is set to release its fiscal third-quarter earnings report on Aug. 7. Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on what to look for in Disney\u2019s earnings and stock. With its 3-star rating, we believe Disney\u2019s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $115 per share. We project linear networks revenue (which no longer includes ESPN after the firm changed its reporting segments) to average 1%-2% annual growth over our five-year forecast. We expect growth to be somewhat choppy from year to year, mostly due to advertising revenue. We project a slight annual decline in the affiliate fees Disney receives from pay-TV distributors, due to a continuing decline in the number of subscribers to pay-TV services. However, we expect the pace of cord-cutting to slow, and the decline should be largely offset by growth in fees over time. Read more about Disney\u2019s fair value estimate. We are maintaining our wide moat rating for Disney. Ultimately, we believe the firm\u2019s ownership of timeless characters and franchises and its ability to continue creating and attracting top-tier content outweigh its near-term challenges related to the evolving media industry. Although we think it\u2019s likely that the lack of the traditional cable television bundle as a foundation will keep Disney from returning to the level of profitability it routinely achieved in years past, we still expect the firm\u2019s returns on invested capital to comfortably exceed its cost of capital over the next 20 years. Recent struggles at Disney are related to the shift from the linear television model\u2014wherein nearly all U.S. households subscribed to a pay-TV service offered by distributors like cable and satellite providers\u2014to the direct-to-consumer, or DTC, streaming model. The attraction of Disney\u2019s top-tier networks, led by ESPN, ABC, and the Disney Channel, resulted in this package of channels being included in nearly all subscriptions at industry-leading rates. Relatively high levels of television viewership also boosted advertising revenue. Cord-cutting and a decline in linear viewership have dampened both revenue streams. Read more about Disney\u2019s moat rating. Disney is in sound financial health. While its debt load and financial leverage are still higher than they\u2019ve historically been, they\u2019ve declined each year since 2020. The firm ended fiscal 2023 with $32 billion in net debt and a 2.2 net debt/EBITDA ratio, both marking their lowest levels since 2018. Leverage may take a step back in 2024 as the firm buys the remaining one-third stake in Hulu, which should be in the $10 billion range. From there, we expect Disney\u2019s financial standing to improve further as its DTC streaming business moves to profitability by fiscal 2025. Disney\u2019s cash flow outlook is now much improved after it was crunched by the pandemic and investments in its streaming service. The firm generated $5 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2023, the most since 2018, and cash generation should continue rising. The company had enough cash on the balance sheet at the end of 2023\u2014over $14 billion\u2014to fund the Hulu purchase, but we expect the firm to take on some incremental debt unless it sells other assets. Read more about financial strength. Our Uncertainty Rating for Disney is High. The current evolution of the media industry is the main factor behind our assessment. Outside its parks and experiences business, Disney historically had three main sources of revenue: fees it received from pay-TV distributors to carry the Disney bundle of channels, television advertising, and licensing fees for movies and television programming distributed by third parties. All these sources are now under pressure. Cord-cutting and diminished linear television viewership have depressed carriage fees and advertising revenue. Shorter runs in movie theaters and an industry shift toward DTC streaming services have depressed licensing revenue. Read more about Disney\u2019s risk and uncertainty.

        "body": "Intel INTC reported disappointing second-quarter results while providing investors with a gloomy third-quarter forecast, suspending its dividend, and outlining a hefty cost-cutting program considering softer demand. Intel\u2019s stock fell as much as 20% after hours, and we think the severe negative reaction was justified. We have cut our fair value estimate to $21 per share from $30 and do not see the selloff as a buying opportunity, as we are concerned about Intel\u2019s competitive positioning. Even though Intel is doing the proper work to focus on leading-edge chip manufacturing, it appears that many of its customers in various end markets might be leaving Intel behind. In the June quarter, revenue was $12.8 billion, up 1% sequentially, down 1% year over year, and below the midpoint of guidance of $12.5 billion-$13.5 billion. However, the horror came from the adjusted gross margin of only 38.7%, down 640 basis points sequentially and worse than guidance of 43.5%. Intel shifted production of its latest PC processors from a low-volume (but lower-cost) facility in Oregon to its high-volume (but much higher-cost, for now) plant in Ireland. Intel thinks this was the proper long-term shift, but we fear the firm rushed this processor (former codename Meteor Lake) to prime-time production in the face of intense competition for the artificial intelligence PC, perhaps speaking to the relative lack of competitiveness of prior-gen CPUs. Intel expects September-quarter revenue of $13.0 billion, well below our prior forecast and FactSet consensus estimates of $14.4 billion. Adjusted gross margin should remain disappointing at 38%. Intel is seeing an inventory buildup for both PC CPUs and CPUs used in servers, the latter due to a capital expenditure mix shift at cloud companies toward AI servers. Given Intel\u2019s high fixed costs and massive manufacturing transitions, any revenue shortfalls leave the firm nowhere to hide on the profitability front next quarter."

Watching customer adoption on Palantir\u2019s AI platform. With its 4-star rating, we believe Verizon\u2019s stock is undervalued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $54 per share, which is roughly 7.9 times our 2024 EBITDA forecast. Our valuation also implies an 8.2% free cash flow yield based on Verizon\u2019s performance in 2023. Higher cash taxes and interest costs will likely offset business growth and lower capital spending in 2024, leaving free cash flow roughly flat for the year. We expect Verizon will gradually lose postpaid wireless market share as it prioritizes pricing stability rather than growth. Smaller rivals T-Mobile and AT&T have similar network resources and should be able to attract roughly the same number of customers each quarter as Verizon. This parity should naturally cause the firms\u2019 market shares to converge slowly. With a rational competitive environment allowing for stable service pricing and increasingly modest phone credits, we expect revenue per postpaid customer will grow steadily in the coming years. Read more about Verizon\u2019s fair value estimate. Verizon\u2019s narrow moat stems from cost advantages in its wireless business and the industry\u2019s efficient scale characteristics. The firm has organized its business along customer lines, but we believe it is best understood along wireless and fixed-line dimensions. The wireless business produces about 70% of service revenue but contributes nearly all of Verizon\u2019s profits. We estimate wireless returns on invested capital were about 16% before 2021. With heavy investment to acquire additional spectrum in the C-band auction and subsequent spending to put that spectrum to use, we estimate wireless returns on capital have declined to the low-double digits, still leaving Verizon ahead of its cost of capital. Verizon, AT&T T, and T-Mobile TMUS dominate the US wireless market, claiming over 90% of retail postpaid phone customers. Solid nationwide coverage requires heavy fixed investments in wireless spectrum and network infrastructure. While a larger customer base does require incremental investment in network capacity, a significant portion of costs are either fixed or more efficiently absorbed as network utilization reaches optimal levels in more locations. Read more about Verizon\u2019s economic moat. Verizon took on more than $65 billion of incremental debt in 2014 to finance the purchase of Vodafone\u2019s 45% stake in the Verizon Wireless joint venture. Following that transaction, net debt increased to $106 billion, or 2.5 times EBITDA, prompting downgrades from the major credit rating agencies. At the time, management pledged to reduce leverage and reach its pre-buyout credit rating of A- within five years, which would have likely required net debt of less than 2 times EBITDA. The firm failed to meet this commitment, with dividends, acquisitions, and spectrum purchases offsetting cash flow. Verizon paid dividends totaling $11 billion in 2023, equal to about 60% of free cash flow. Management expects net leverage to begin declining in 2024 as it uses excess cash to reduce net debt. We still don\u2019t expect the firm to hit the high end of its leverage target until 2026 or 2027, depending on how much secured debt it issues. Read more about Verizon\u2019s financial strength. Our Medium Uncertainty Rating reflects the volatility we think Verizon investors face relative to our global coverage. Verizon primarily sees regulatory and technological uncertainties. Wireless and broadband services are often considered necessary for social inclusion in employment and education. If Verizon\u2019s services are deemed insufficient or overpriced, especially in response to weak competition, regulators or politicians could intervene. Recent media reports have highlighted potential risks related to lead-sheathed cables commonly deployed in telecom networks into the 1960s. The liabilities and costs associated with removing these cables, if deemed necessary, are unknown today. Read more about Verizon\u2019s risk and uncertainty.

        "body": "GE Aerospace GE released its second-quarter earnings report on July 23. Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on GE Aerospace\u2019s earnings and the outlook for its stock. With its 3-star rating, we believe GE Aerospace\u2019s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $170 per share, representing an enterprise value/2024 EBITDA ratio of just under 24 times. With GE\u2019s engines powering nearly three-fourths of global commercial flights, the company\u2019s biggest profit driver is simply more airplanes continuing to take off and land. Read more about GE Aerospace\u2019s fair value estimate. GE Aerospace meets our highest standard of a wide-moat business; it was the crown jewel of the GE conglomerate. We believe it will outearn its cost of capital by a comfortable margin for at least the coming 20 years. We assign GE Aerospace a wide moat rating on switching costs and intangible assets stemming from its massive installed base of aircraft engines and the complex technical know-how it takes to design, produce, and maintain them. GE competes in a virtual duopoly in the wide-body (twin-aisle) jet engine market against Rolls-Royce and in the narrow-body (single-aisle) market against Pratt & Whitney. Including its 50% interest in the CFM joint venture with Safran, GE participates in three-fourths of the commercial jet engine market, as measured by its installed base of more than 40,000 commercial engines. Crucial to GE Aerospace\u2019s moat is that engines typically fly for more than 20 years, and the company\u2019s commercial and engine services business (representing about 75% of total revenue) makes 70% of that revenue from servicing its engines. This means GE Aerospace alone commands approximately 40% of the global engine maintenance, repair, and overhaul market. Read more about GE Aerospace\u2019s economic moat. As of year-end 2023, and accounting for the spinoff of GE Vernova GEV, GE Aerospace\u2019s net debt amounted to $7 billion, close to 1 times 2023 EBITDA coverage and lower than many aerospace peers. We expect GE Aerospace\u2019s EBITDA to grow and think the company\u2019s credit ratings are likely to improve over time. Its securities portfolio of over $40 billion secures the similarly valued liabilities of the legacy long-term-care insurance portfolio. Only in an improbable scenario would we foresee the insurance book draining the firm\u2019s resources. We expect GE Aerospace to eventually wind down or dispose of its real estate and long-term-care insurance portfolios, the remnants of conglomerate GE still on the books. Until then, a remote financial risk remains, should payouts from long-term-care policies outstrip the reserves GE has put aside to cover them. Read more about GE Aerospace\u2019s financial strength. We assign GE Aerospace a Medium Uncertainty Rating, in line with our broader aerospace coverage. The company bears some remote financial and ongoing operational risk to its manufacturing and service business. More important to the core business are two operational risks. Complex manufacturing is subject to supply chain risk, in the form of the materials needed to build or service an engine and the people who do the work. Future supply chain bottlenecks or workforce disruption could mar the company\u2019s revenue and profitability in one or more product lines at almost any time. A more pernicious risk to long-term profitability would be posed by a potential systemic flaw in one of the company\u2019s engine designs or manufacturing quality. Pratt & Whitney saw this with a metallurgy flaw in its GTF engine, which resulted in over $3 billion in cash charges. Since a good portion of GE\u2019s engines are serviced on long-term contracts, the company assumes most of the risk of cost overruns from unforeseen repairs.

        "body": "Coinbase COIN reported second-quarter results that were a bit worse than we expected. Revenue increased 108% from last year but declined 13% from the previous quarter to $1.38 billion. Meanwhile, net income increased to $36 million from a loss of $97 million last year, though this includes $248 million in after-tax losses on the firm\u2019s cryptocurrency investment portfolio. As we incorporate these results, we do not plan to materially alter our fair value estimate of $130 per share. Coinbase\u2019s transactional income increased 139% from last year to $781 million. Retail trading income (the firm\u2019s largest source of revenue) increased to $664.8 million from $289 million last year, though this was a sharp drop from the $935 million reported last quarter. We expected some sequential headwinds in trading revenue despite higher average cryptocurrency prices in the quarter. First-quarter results enjoyed the benefit of a major rally in cryptocurrency, which drove high volatility and trading volume. That said, the drop in US retail trading activity was a bit steeper than we expected (though cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile), and we caution against extrapolating too much from sequential trends. On a more positive note, Coinbase\u2019s subscription and services had another strong quarter, with revenue increasing to $599 million from $335.4 million last year. The star of the show was Coinbase\u2019s USDC revenue, which increased 59% year over year and 22% quarter over quarter to $240 million. While USDC\u2019s market capitalization is still well below its old high (a lingering legacy of becoming caught up in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank), the stablecoin is clearly on better footing. Still, this line item will likely begin to face headwinds. As a reminder, Coinbase generates its stablecoin revenue through interest on collateral used to maintain its peg to the US dollar, and anticipated interest rate cuts will directly impact this revenue."

        "body": "After posting surprisingly strong revenue and providing an upbeat forecast last quarter, Snap SNAP did the opposite this time, sending its shares sharply lower. Results were particularly disappointing relative to the solid digital advertising demand giants Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL have generally seen. Our growth outlook for Snap was already conservative, and as with last quarter, we\u2019re maintaining our $14 fair value estimate. Growth in daily active users continued to steadily slow during the quarter, increasing 8.8% year over year to 432 million. Snap disclosed that monthly active users have reached 850 million, indicating that engagement (the ratio between daily and monthly users) has held roughly constant over the past couple of years. The North American daily user count remained flat at 100 million, down about 1% compared with the prior year. Management continues pointing to various initiatives to drive increased user growth and engagement, such as map features, new lenses, and AI-driven content recommendations. Still, we think the social media landscape favors the largest players that have developed stronger network effects. Total revenue increased 16% from last year to $1.2 billion, falling just below the midpoint of management\u2019s forecast range. Revenue per daily user increased 6.3%, with solid growth in all regions, but gains were not as impressive as in the prior quarter. Ad impressions increased 13% year over year while ad prices were down 3%, with weakness in brand advertising offsetting strong direct-response demand. Snap continues to focus its efforts on small and medium-sized businesses, with the number of active advertisers doubling year over year. The operating loss narrowed to $254 million from $404 million a year ago. We continue to expect Snap won\u2019t reach operating profitability until 2028."

        "body": " We raise our fair value estimate for wide-moat Microsoft MSFT to $490 per share, from $435 after the company delivered another good quarter overall, even if it was in line with our expectations on headline numbers. In an earnings call packed with new data points around artificial intelligence-related demand, which were impressive, in our view, the single most important item was guidance that calls for Azure revenue to accelerate in the second half of the year as the current surging investment in data center capacity comes online. Therefore, we raised our revenue growth estimates for the medium term, and we also tweaked our profitability assumptions higher based on consistently good performance and a solid outlook. Revenue was again governed by data center capacity constraints and several pockets of slight weakness arising in Europe. With shares down slightly afterhours following a recent pullback, we see the stock as attractive. We see results reinforcing our long-term thesis, which centers on the proliferation of hybrid cloud environments and Azure. The firm continues to use its on-premises dominance to allow clients to move to the cloud at their own pace. We center our growth assumptions around Azure, Microsoft 365 E5 migration, and traction with the Power Platform for long-term value creation. AI is also quickly supplementing growth, which we see as another secular driver. For the June quarter, revenue increased 15% year over year to $64.73 billion, compared with the midpoint of guidance of $64.00 billion. Activision added about $1.68 billion, or 3 points of growth, to revenue. Relative to the year-ago period, productivity and business processes rose 11%, intelligent cloud increased 19%, and more personal computing expanded 14%. Compared with guidance, both PBP and MPC came in above the high end, while IC was just below the midpoint. Good sales execution and sales mix toward software, away from hardware, supported margins. We see near-term demand as good, based on stout forward-looking metrics. Commercial bookings grew 19% year over year in constant currency based on strength in large Azure deals, while remaining performance obligations increased 20% year over year to $269 billion. Renewals also remain strong, which we think is partly driven by high interest in AI and consistently good execution. Intelligent cloud performance was critical in solid results this quarter, as Microsoft continues to distance itself from the pack in terms of AI leadership. Microsoft cloud revenue increased 21% to $36.8 billion. Azure remains the key driver, growing 30% in constant currency, compared with guidance of 30%-31%. We think this trivial hiccup is to blame for a minor after-hours selloff \u2014 Azure revenue did not come in at the top end of guidance. As management has been saying for several quarters, the company is capacity-constrained within Azure. Said another way, despite the book of business being $22 billion quarter and despite capacity issues, Azure still grew 30% year over year, which is impressive and signifies a thirst for AI services on the part of customers. After contributing 300 basis points to Azure growth in the September quarter, 600 basis points in the December quarter, and 700 basis points of growth in the June quarter, AI workloads drove 800 basis points of Azure growth this quarter. Management noted that Copilot customers grew more than 60% sequentially, while Azure AI customers grew nearly 60% year over year to more than 60,000, and customers are already coming back for more seats. In PBP, office and dynamics continue to power performance and drove solid results. Overall, the segment revenue was up 11% year over year. Dynamics increased 16% in constant currency, Dynamics 365 grew 20% in constant currency, and Office commercial products and cloud services rose 13% in constant currency. Overall small and medium business performed reasonably well, but continued to show signs of moderation, while Copilot add-ons helped per-seat pricing. Lastly, management disclosed that Teams now has more than 3 million premium seats. MPC drove the most upside relative to the company\u2019s guidance for the second consecutive quarter, with the year-over-year comparison distorted by the Activision acquisition. Windows, Activision, and search and advertising all performed well during the quarter, which supported revenue outperformance. We see early signs of success for the Activision deal, with Diablo 4 added to Game Pass, resulting in strong user adds and engagement. Due to several pressure points, including the Activision headwinds and accounting changes for server depreciation, margins were largely in line with our expectations. Margins have been a source of strength for most of our coverage in recent quarters. Further, Microsoft continues to make heavy data center capacity investments that will pressure gross margin in fiscal 2025. GAAP operating margin was 43.1%, compared with 43.1% last year and the midpoint of guidance at 42.3%, with relative strength driven by continued careful cost management and favorable product mix. Regarding mix, Xbox and Surface revenue was diminished, while Server, Windows, Azure, and other software solutions were strong. Guidance was approximately in line overall for the first quarter relative to our estimates, with revenue being slightly shy and EPS slightly better. Management maintained its outlook from last quarter for the full year, which included double-digit revenue growth and a 1-percentage-point decline in operating margin. The outlook for the September quarter calls for revenue of $63.8 billion-$64.8 billion and an implied operating margin of approximately 45.1% at the midpoint. Microsoft expects Azure to grow 29%-30% year over year in the first quarter, which, in a vacuum, is impressive. However, management noted that heavy capital expenditure investment would lead to capacity coming online in the second half of the year, allowing Azure growth to accelerate from already high levels. Capex is expected to be up again in fiscal 2025. On this point, management indicated that capex was overwhelmingly related to Azure this quarter, and approximately 50% of capex was for long-term assets, such as land and buildings, while 50% was for equipment, including servers and network gear. Microsoft is building to demand signals and can pull back on the equipment side of the equation in relatively short order should demand materialize more slowly than expected. Given early demand signals and the massive success of similar Azure investments more than a decade ago, we believe these investments will pay off for the company and investors."

        "author": "Karen Andersen, CFA",
        "body": "We\u2019re maintaining our fair value estimate of $227 for Moderna MRNA despite management\u2019s disappointing commentary about the firm\u2019s competitiveness in the upcoming covid and RSV vaccination season, as well as lower product sales guidance for the full year. Second-quarter results were in line with our expectations, with minimal product sales of $184 million consistent with our off-season expectations in the covid vaccine market. However, management now expects $3.0 billion-$3.5 billion in net product sales for the full year (down from prior guidance of $4 billion) for its respiratory franchise, due to a combination of low European Union sales, revenue being deferred to 2025 in other international markets, and the competitive landscape in the United States. We think management\u2019s commentary implies Moderna is seeing strong US pricing pressure in both the established covid vaccine market (against key competitor Pfizer PFE) and the RSV vaccine market, where the company is attempting to launch newly approved mResvia against Pfizer\u2019s Abrysvo and GSK\u2019s GSK Arexvy, which were both introduced last season. As a result, we\u2019ve lowered our assumed global covid vaccine sales for 2024 from $3.7 billion to $2.7 billion and our assumed RSV vaccine sales in the US market from $500 million to $350 million. In the long run, we think Moderna can still see peak RSV vaccine sales of around $2.5 billion, as approval should eventually extend to most high-risk populations."

        "body": "Albemarle\u2019s ALB second-quarter results reflected declining lithium prices, as companywide adjusted EBITDA plummeted 70% versus the prior-year quarter. Management announced further capital expenditure reductions and cost-cutting initiatives in response. Most notably, the company signaled it would place phase two of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility into care and maintenance and stop work on phase three. Management also said it will reduce its unit production costs to boost profits in the wake of lower lithium prices and cut capital expenditure further in 2025 and beyond. We\u2019re updating our model to assume lower lithium volumes for Albemarle, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. We\u2019ve also lowered our lithium price outlook. Our updated forecast is for prices to average $20,000 per metric ton over the next decade, which aligns with our view of the marginal cost of production. This is below our prior forecast that prices would average $25,000 per metric ton. As a result, we\u2019re reducing our fair value estimate to $225 from $275. Roughly half of the cut is due to lower volumes, while the other half is due to lower prices. Our narrow moat rating is unchanged. We\u2019re raising our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Very High from High. At current prices, we view Albemarle shares as materially undervalued, trading in 5-star territory and a little more than 40% of our updated fair value estimate. Shares trade around our downside scenario, producing a fair value estimate of $90. In our downside scenario, we assume lithium prices average a little less than $15,000 per metric ton over the next decade, which is well below our current view of the marginal cost of production. In response, we assume little long-term volume growth. As a result, we view current prices as offering a strong margin of safety, with a lower-for-longer scenario already priced into the stock."

        "body": "Exchange-traded funds make it easy to diversify a portfolio and are often easier for investors to buy than their mutual fund counterparts. That\u2019s because they\u2019re traded on an exchange and don\u2019t have the investment minimums that some mutual funds do. But not all ETFs are alike. There are many options to choose from, so it\u2019s important to identify high-quality ETFs that meet the needs of your portfolio. Morningstar rates ETFs relative to their category peers, so you can find best-in-class options in the areas that are important to you. We break down our list of the best ETFs by category, so you can understand the roles these funds can play in your portfolio as you consider your options. The first step to finding the best ETF for you is understanding its role in your portfolio. Start by determining your asset allocation\u2014the mix of stocks, bonds, cash, and other investments in your portfolio. Factors like your investing timeline, risk tolerance and capacity, and investing goals make your \u201cright\u201d asset-allocation mix unique to you, but Morningstar\u2019s Christine Benz recommends using the Morningstar Lifetime Allocation Indexes as a starting point. Once you have a sense of an appropriate asset-allocation mix, you can think of your investments as building blocks. The largest and most important components are your core holdings, or the assets that make up the majority of your portfolio\u2019s assets. Once those positions are filled, you can choose to add noncore holdings that play a smaller role in your portfolio. Core investments should be broadly diversified, low-cost funds that cover the major asset classes: You can further diversify by adding other asset classes or subasset classes, but a portfolio made of core holdings can stand on its own. Still, even simple diversification can reduce the risk in your portfolio by lowering the chances that all your investments lose value at the same time. Whether a key building block in your portfolio or a niche addition, there are ETFs that fit nearly every role. The best ETFs receive Morningstar Medalist Ratings of Gold, the highest rating on a five-tier scale that consists of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative.\u00a0 The Morningstar Medalist Rating may be assigned by an analyst or driven by quantitative algorithms that allow Morningstar to scale its fund coverage. To narrow the scope of this list, the funds below have ratings assigned by analysts.  The Morningstar Medalist Rating is a forward-looking measure of Morningstar\u2019s confidence in a fund\u2019s ability to beat its peers, after accounting for fees and risk, through a market cycle. Medals (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) indicate that analysts expect a fund to outperform its peers over a full market cycle; Neutral and Negative ratings mean that analysts aren\u2019t confident in a fund\u2019s ability to do so. A fund\u2019s rating is based on an assessment of the fund managers\u2019 approach to their investment strategy (Process), the individuals who manage the fund (People), and the asset manager that offers the fund (Parent). These pillar assessments also account for other factors like Price and Performance. The relative impact of each pillar on the overall rating depends on whether a fund is actively or passively managed. For the many ETFs that are passively managed, the Process Pillar is more important than the People assessment. The majority of the Gold-rated ETFs, listed below, consist of low-cost, passively managed funds that our analysts believe will tightly track a reasonable index over a long time frame. Many of these ETFs can be core holdings in a portfolio; few niche ETFs receive Gold ratings because they take on too much risk by targeting narrower themes. Stocks have the highest growth potential among the core asset classes, but they also carry the most risk. Investors with long investing horizons will likely put most, if not all, of their portfolio assets into stocks. Most of the best stock ETFs are passive, broadly diversified U.S. large-cap stock funds that can fill a core spot in a portfolio. A handful of funds that invest in other domestic equity categories also made the cut. High-quality options that provide foreign stock exposure round out the list. If you\u2019re looking for a passive core holding, consider starting with a large-cap ETF. Large companies dominate the stock market; such firms account for over 75% of the U.S. market\u2019s value. In particular, ETFs in the large-blend category are about as \u201ccore\u201d as you can get because they include both growth and value stocks. All but four of the best large-cap U.S. stock ETFs are passive. Morningstar research has shown that most active managers haven\u2019t added much value over their respective benchmark indexes in this part of the market, so low-cost index funds are terrific options here. You can use international stock exposure to counterbalance some of your U.S.-specific risk and round out your portfolio\u2019s core stock allocation. ETFs in the foreign large-blend category are good candidates to anchor your portfolio while the small/mid-cap and European stock funds can further diversify your foreign stock exposure. And if you want to cover both domestic and international stocks with a single ETF, those in the global large-stock blend category can be excellent options. You can supplement your domestic stock allocation with exposure to domestic small- or mid-cap stocks, but these funds aren\u2019t necessarily a core piece of the portfolio. Depending on the composition of your large-blend fund, you may have sufficient exposure to these areas already. The real estate ETFs that made the list can be helpful long-term diversifiers because of the low correlation between REITs and the stock market. Bonds can help reduce the risk in your portfolio, which is helpful as your investing timeline gets shorter and your goal shifts from maximizing your potential return to maintaining your accumulated wealth. Low expenses are an even bigger performance differentiator for safer, low-returning assets like bonds than they are for higher-returning assets like stocks. For that reason, low-cost ETFs can be valuable building blocks in this area. If short-term cash needs aren\u2019t a concern, high-quality intermediate-term bond funds are good options for fixed-income exposure. If you\u2019re looking to fill a relatively small bond allocation, one ETF in the intermediate core bond category is likely enough. There are also high-quality offerings in the intermediate core-plus bond category if you want to lean into some noncore bond exposure. If you\u2019re looking to hold bonds in a taxable account, you may want to consider municipal bonds. While Morningstar generally recommends traditional mutual funds for muni exposure, one municipal-bond ETF managed to earn a Gold rating. While not for everyone, short-term and inflation-protected bond ETFs can provide diversification in a bond-heavy portfolio. You can also use short-term bond funds to help cover your short-term spending. Funds focused on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities can be particularly helpful if you want to add some defense against high inflation, but they\u2019re best kept in a tax-sheltered account because of their high tax costs.

After such significant underperformance over such a long period of time, small-cap stocks could certainly have more room to run. In fact, Morningstar US Market Strategist Dave Sekera points out in his 3Q stock market outlook that small-cap stocks looked significantly undervalued heading into the third quarter while large-cap stocks looked overvalued. \u201cWe continue to advocate for an underweight position in large-cap stocks in favor of overweighting small-cap stocks and a slight overweighting in mid-cap stocks,\u201d he noted in his report.

Notably, most of the names on our list of the best small-cap stocks to buy have High or Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Ratings. The higher a company\u2019s uncertainty, the less predictable its cash flows are. By their very nature, smaller companies are more likely to have higher uncertainty. To compensate for this, it\u2019s especially important to buy small-cap stocks at prices that are well below what they\u2019re worth\u2014and to invest in them for the long term. Here\u2019s a little more about each of the top small-cap stocks on our list. Data is as of July 15, 2024. Lithium Americas (Argentina) tops our list of the best small-cap stocks to buy; the cheap stock is trading a stunning 87% below our fair value estimate of $25. Lithium Argentina is a pure-play lithium producer that was created as a result of the former Lithium Americas separation, which split the firm\u2019s Argentina and North America businesses. The company\u2019s first project entered production late last year. Morningstar expects lithium demand to grow at nearly a 20% annual rate from over 900,000 metric tons in 2023 to over 2.5 million metric tons by 2030, confirms Morningstar strategist Seth Goldstein. \u201cFor all lithium companies, we view the rise of lithium prices as the largest and most important catalyst that should send shares closer to our fair value estimates,\u201d he argues. The second lithium producer on our list of top small-cap stocks to buy, Arcadium Lithium is 73% undervalued relative to our $14.00 fair value estimate. Arcadium Lithium is a pure-play lithium producer that was formed in the Allkem-Livent merger in January 2024 and is a top-five lithium producer globally. \u201cWe think the market is assuming lower [lithium] prices for longer, which creates a strong opportunity for investors to pick up shares of high-quality lithium producers, including Arcadium, with a strong margin of safety,\u201d suggests Morningstar\u2019s Goldstein. The cheapest apparel maker on our list of the best small-cap stocks to buy for the long term, VF stock is 70% undervalued. Its portfolio includes popular brands Vans, The North Face, and Timberland. The company is in the midst of a turnaround plan to cut costs, reduce debt, operate more efficiently, and improve Vans\u2019 sales and profitability, says Morningstar senior analyst David Swartz. \u201cVF has struggled greatly over the past few quarters, but we believe it will grow faster than most competitors in the long run and maintain its competitive edge,\u201d he adds. We think VF stock is worth $48.00 per share. The second apparel maker on our list of the top small-cap stocks to buy for the long term, Hanesbrands stock is 67% undervalued according to our metrics. A market leader in basic innerwear, the company made headlines several weeks ago when it announced plans to sell its Champion brand to Authentic Brands. \u201cWe think the sale of Champion will have a positive effect on long-term profit margins as innerwear is generally more profitable than Champion, and the sale should allow management to focus on the innerwear brands,\u201d says Morningstar\u2019s Swartz. We assign the stock a $15.80 fair value estimate. What you need to know about the advantages and risks of investing in small-cap stocks. Adient is the leader in the automotive seating market. Seating isn\u2019t a commodity market, as some might expect, says Morningstar strategist David Whiston. In fact, Adient has just one significant global competitor. Earnings last quarter were good but overshadowed by management\u2019s cut to guidance, explains Whiston. We shaved a few dollars from our fair value estimate as a result, but we think Adient stock is extremely undervalued and a top small-cap stock to buy for the long term, as it trades 63% below our $68.00 fair value estimate. Compass Minerals stock trades 50% below our $25.00 fair value estimate. This small company produces salt and specialty potash fertilizer, and its portfolio of cost-advantaged assets is \u201cenviable,\u201d according to Morningstar\u2019s Goldstein. In January, Compass Minerals saw a change in CEO; we expect the leadership change to signal a renewed focus on cost reduction and drive free cash flow generation, says Goldstein. To that end, the company cut its dividend entirely in May, directing all free cash flow toward debt reduction over the next several years. O-I Glass stock trades 47% below our $22.00 fair value estimate. One of the world\u2019s largest glass container manufacturers, O-I continues to face persistent inventory destocking across much of its portfolio, reports Morningstar analyst Spencer Liberman. Although we expect demand headwinds to persist for the remainder of the year, we think this small company should benefit from a long-term shift toward eco-friendly packaging, adds Liberman. The only technology stock on our list of some of the best small-cap stocks to buy, Lyft looks 46% undervalued relative to our $25.00 fair value estimate. We don\u2019t expect Lyft to take market share from Uber but rather to maintain its number-two position in the US duopoly ride-hailing market, says Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan. We forecast that Lyft will become free cash flow-positive in 2024 and project that Lyft\u2019s net revenue over the next five years will grow 11% annually on average. This undervalued small-cap stock trades 46% below our $110.00 fair value estimate. FMC is a pure-play crop chemical producer and one of the five-largest patented crop-protection companies globally. A pipeline of new premium products should allow FMC to continue producing new crop chemicals as older products roll off patent, says Morningstar\u2019s Goldstein. \u201cFollowing customer inventory destocking that weighed on FMC\u2019s 2023 and early 2024 results, we point to the end of destocking as a catalyst for the shares,\u201d he says. \u201cWe expect FMC\u2019s second-quarter results will show improvement, with a return to profit growth in the second half of the year.\u201d Polaris rounds out our list of the best small-cap stocks to buy. Polaris is one of the longest-operating brands in powersports. \u201cWe believe that its brands, innovative products, and lean manufacturing yield the firm a wide economic moat and that it stands to capitalize on its research and development, solid quality, operational excellence, and acquisition strategy,\u201d explains Morningstar senior analyst Jaime Katz. Although this small company continues to face industry inventory headwinds, we think it\u2019s positioned well to maintain its market share. The stock trades 51% below our $145.00 fair value estimate. Here\u2019s a rundown of the Morningstar ratings and metrics we considered when compiling the list of the top small-cap stocks to buy for the long term. The Morningstar fair value estimate represents what Morningstar analysts think a particular stock is worth. Fair value estimates are rooted in the fundamentals and based on how much cash we think a company can generate in the future, not on fleeting metrics such as recent earnings or current stock price momentum. The Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating is an assessment of how well a company manages its balance sheet, investments, and shareholders\u2019 distributions. Analysts assign each company one of three ratings\u2014Exemplary, Standard, or Poor\u2014based on their assessments of how well a management team provides shareholder returns. The Morningstar Economic Moat Rating gauges how likely a company is to keep competitors at bay for the foreseeable future. Companies that we expect to maintain their competitive edge for two decades or more are assigned a wide moat rating; those we expect to remain competitive for at least a decade earn a narrow moat rating; and those that have yet to carve out competitive advantages earn a moat rating of none. Of course, there are many other criteria that investors can use to find small-cap stocks to buy for the long term. Here are some tools to find more ideas to research further: Here\u2019s the new list of Morningstar\u2019s top underpriced analyst picks to buy for the third quarter of 2024. Cheap high-quality names from the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index are attractive stocks to buy for long-term investors. These undervalued stocks with reliable dividends are worth considering. "

        "body": "The post-pandemic travel boom remains in flight, with many consumers undeterred by inflation. But even against this positive backdrop, several key travel stocks trade at attractive prices. Morningstar analysts Dan Wasiolek and Jaime M. Katz still see \u201ccompelling opportunities\u201d for long-term investors. These four stocks are their top picks: It took time for the industry to heal from the damage done by the pandemic and subsequent surge in inflation. With inflation coming down over the past year and consistent consumer spending, demand has been high. Underlying that demand is remote work flexibility and \u201ca human-ingrained desire to travel,\u201d Katz and Wasiolek say. In the background, leisure travel is \u201cholding up well,\u201d while business travel has shown nascent improvement. \u201cWe think demand tailwinds will help offset any potential macroeconomic concerns, barring a severe recession, which we see as unlikely,\u201d Katz and Wasiolek explain. \u201cWhile leisure and domestic road travel patterns have moderated, we think business and group trips, international visits, and leisure excursions by sea will now support leisure demand.\u201d Among hotels, first-quarter occupancy at operators covered by Morningstar was flat from a year earlier, representing 93% of 2019\u2032s pre-pandemic occupancy. For cruise lines, advanced ticket sales have been \u201crobust,\u201d according to Morningstar analysts. Total deposits of the four publicly traded cruise operators were roughly $17 billion in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 17% over last year. \u201cThis figure conveys a higher commitment to cruising than before the coronavirus pandemic, when the operators held $10 billion in advance ticket sales,\u201d Katz and Wasiolek say. These are Katz and Wasiolek\u2019s predictions for the year: Here\u2019s a closer look at Katz and Wasiolek\u2019s top four travel stocks. \u201cWe believe Carnival shares are incorporating either a slowdown in leisure demand or pricing growth, rather than improvement stemming from increased penetration of the global travel demand base. Moreover, we think Carnival is uniquely positioned to benefit from a more efficient fleet composition (after disposing of 26 ships in 2020-22), which should benefit the cost structure more than initially expected, particularly with the fleet at full deployment. \u201cWith the industry operating at full occupancy, opportunities to improve Carnival\u2019s profit margins should surface. These include increased scale, improved brand awareness via tactical marketing spending, and better profitability from its mix. These factors should help increase adjusted EBITDA margins to around 27% at the end of our forecast, supported by low-single-digit price and cost growth. This is in line with the average EBITDA the company achieved in the five years ending in 2019.\u201d Read more of Jaime M. Katz\u2019s commentary here. \u201cWe think concerns about Sabre\u2019s financial health, competitive positioning, and lower corporate travel demand have presented an opportunity to own a company with a network, efficient scale, and switching cost advantages at an attractive margin of safety. \u201cSabre\u2019s global distribution system holds material aggregation and processing advantages over competing alternatives. Although we think some corporate travel could be displaced in the long term by video conferencing, we still expect business trips to rebound. As a result, we believe Sabre\u2019s sales can return to 2019 levels by 2028.\u201d Read more of Dan Wasiolek\u2019s commentary here. \u201cWe believe Expedia shares are discounting the benefit of enduring travel demand and investments the company has made the past few years. We surmise these will drive expanding operating margins and ongoing sales growth while supporting the company\u2019s network effect. \u201cThe company has restructured its platform from a less effective \u2018invest in every brand in all regions\u2019 approach to investing only in brands in specific regions where they are resonating with travellers. It has also allowed for the sharing of consumer data analytics and loyalty status across its portfolio, which should drive market efficiencies and high-quality traffic to its platform, buttressing its competitive position. As a result, we expect strong sales growth of 6% on average during the next 10 years, with operating margins of 12.7% in 2033 versus the 7.5% reported in 2019.\u201d Read more of Dan Wasiolek\u2019s commentary here. \u201cNorwegian\u2019s use of strategic marketing rather than excessive discounting to fill ships gives us confidence in its ability to lift pricing during periods of stable economic growth. In our opinion, this positions Norwegian to achieve 3%-4% average yield growth over time. Along with the shift in fleet mix, this should help the firm reach high-20% EBITDA margins over the next decade, near the 31% rate it booked before the pandemic in 2019. \u201cMoreover, the risk of value-destroying capital raises is insignificant, as the company refocused on shoring up its balance sheet. The company has around $1.7 billion in borrowings coming due over the next 12 months and had $2.4 billion in liquidity as of March 31. As such, we see the risk of an equity raise as negligible. Rather, we think shares remain depressed, given investor concern around a potential recession and its potential impact on discretionary spending.\u201d Read more of Jaime M. Katz\u2019s commentary here."
