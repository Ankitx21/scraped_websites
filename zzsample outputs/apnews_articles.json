Spoors and Francis won the gold medal in the women\u2019s double sculls, while Glover \u2014 a mother of three \u2014 took silver in the women\u2019s four. Shortly after Spoors and Francis crossed the line, they were picking up their toddlers in the stands to hug them. \u201cI spotted them in the stands, managed to give them little cuddle as well,\u201d Francis said. \u201cI think they are looking forward to getting their mums back.\u201d The New Zealanders used to sing children\u2019s songs during training sessions to motivate each other after rough nights waking up to care for their babies. They brought their families to Paris so they could focus on the competition. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly special,\u201d Francis said. \u201cRaising kids isn\u2019t easy. It takes a village, and we\u2019ve had that whole village behind us this whole way. It only makes that much more special. Even just the fact that our families are here, let alone our kids, and our kids get to see this legacy now.\u201d Spoors said she and Francis had been receiving messages of support from competitors and other teams saying how much they respected them. \u201cBrooke\u2019s been doing exactly the same as me and, because we\u2019re in the same position, I think we know what each other has been going through,\u201d Spoors said. \u201cSo that\u2019s been a real driving force underneath it all.\u201d \n Glover, who has spoken about the challenge of breastfeeding her children while training, went straight to high-five her children after finishing her race, then got to hug them after the medal ceremony. \u201cThey were absolutely loving it,\u201d she said.

(AP) \u2014 Sea lions are stranding themselves on a long stretch of the California coast and showing signs that they may have been poisoned by a bloom of harmful algae, experts said Thursday. The Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute said that since July 26, it has been inundated by daily reports of sick sea lions along 155 miles (249 kilometers) of shoreline in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, northwest of Los Angeles. The marine mammals are suffering from domoic acid, a neurotoxin that affects the brain and heart, the institute said in a statement. The poisoning event is largely affecting adult female California sea lions, it said. The nonprofit said it had rescued 23 animals so far. Coastal Vandenberg Space Force Base released photos of sea lions being rescued from one of its beaches on July 29. The California coast commonly sees outbreaks of domoic acid poisoning, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s NOAA Fisheries. An outbreak last year was particularly severe, with hundreds sea lions and dozens of dolphins dying in the first weeks of June. The poison is produced by microscopic algae that are consumed by shellfish and small fish that are then eaten by sea lions, dolphins and birds. Symptoms in affected sea lions may include disorientation, head weaving, foaming at the mouth and seizures. People can also get sickened."

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The criminal case charging former President Donald Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election was returned Friday to the trial judge in Washington after a Supreme Court opinion last month that narrowed the scope of the prosecution. The case was formally sent back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan for further proceedings aimed at sorting out which acts in the landmark indictment constitute official acts and which do not.  The procedural move is expected to restart the case with a flurry of motions and potential hearings, but the sheer amount of work ahead for the judge and lawyers ensures that there\u2019s no way a trial can take place before the November presidential election in which Trump is the Republican nominee. If Trump is elected president, he can appoint an attorney general who would presumably order the case dismissed. The four-count indictment, one of four criminal cases brought against Trump last year, accuses him of illegally conspiring to cling to the presidency by working with aides to try to undo the results of the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. But the  Supreme Court on July 1 dealt prosecutors a major blow, ruling in a 6-3 opinion that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for core constitutional duties and are presumptively immune from prosecution for all other official acts.  The justices left it to Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, to decide how to apply their opinion to the remainder of the case.  \n That means she\u2019ll be deciding in the weeks ahead whether key allegations in the case \u2014 including that Trump badgered his vice president, Mike Pence, to reject the official counting of electoral votes showing that he had lost the election \u2014 can remain part of the prosecution or must be discarded. The case brought by special counsel Jack Smith had been effectively frozen since last December amid Trump\u2019s appeal, which was argued in April before the Supreme Court, that he was immune from prosecution for the acts charged in the indictment. A separate case brought by Smith, accusing Trump of illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, was dismissed by a different judge last month who held that Smith\u2019s appointment was illegal. The Justice Department is appealing. The high court\u2019s immunity opinion has been cited by defense lawyers in another of Trump\u2019s prosecutions, with attorneys arguing that his hush money conviction in New York should be set aside in light of the ruling. The judge in the case postponed sentencing and has said he\u2019ll rule on the matter next month. Trump faces a separate prosecution in Fulton County, Georgia, related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election. That case has been significantly delayed, preventing a trial from taking place this year."

It was \u201cimpossible to say\u201d if Adrien Briffod\u2019s gastrointestinal infection is linked to water quality in the River Seine, the Switzerland Olympic team said in a statement. No other cases of Olympic triathletes with stomach problems had been found among other countries that took part in the individual races, the Swiss team\u2019s doctor Hanspeter Betschart said. The health risks of sending triathletes and marathon swimmers into the long-polluted Seine after a $1.5 billion project to clean the water was among the biggest issues for Olympics organizers \u2014 and could yet be the best games legacy for the city of Paris. French president Emmanuel Macron had promised to swim in the Seine to show it is safe and the Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, went in the water one week before the Olympics opened. Lower-quality water after heavy rains pushed back the scheduled Tuesday morning race in men\u2019s triathlon for more than 24 hours. It started immediately after the women\u2019s race Wednesday. Briffod spent 21\u00bd minutes in the Seine completing the 1.5-kilometer (0.93-mile) swimming section to open the race that he finished in 49th place. He had his 30th birthday Friday in Paris. Julie Derron, the women\u2019s silver medalist, is in the Swiss team for the mixed relay Monday, with Cathia Sch\u00e4r, Max Studer and, replacing Briffod, Simon Westermann.

        "body": "Get ready for a meteor shower doubleheader.   The Southern Delta Aquariid meteor shower peaks in late July. And this year, it will coincide with a second smaller meteor shower, the Alpha Capricornids.   The Delta Aquariids occur every year in North America\u2019s late summer. This year\u2019s peak activity happens early Tuesday morning, with an expected 15 to 20 meteors visible per hour in the Northern Hemisphere, under dark skies. Viewing should be even better in the Southern Hemisphere. The shower lasts through August 21, according to the American Meteor Society.   Around the same time, the Alpha Capricornid meteor shower should produce around five meteors per hour and lasts through August 15.   Here\u2019s what to know about the Delta Aquariids and other meteor showers.     Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don\u2019t need special equipment to see them.   Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets. The source of the Delta Aquariids is thought to be from the comet 96P/Machholz. The Alpha Capricornids originate from the comet 169P/NEAT.  When rocks from space enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d   The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky. \n  These two meteor showers are not high volume, but the Alpha Capricornids often produces very bright meteors, said University of Warwick astronomer Don Pollacco.  For skygazers, \u201cone bright one is worth 20 faint ones,\u201d he said.      Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.   It\u2019s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.  And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you aren\u2019t checking your phone. \u201cIt ruins your night vision,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Bill Cooke.  The Southern Hemisphere will have the best view of Delta Aquariids. Coinciding with a waning moon around 30% full means the clearest viewing will happen after midnight.     The meteor society keeps an updated list of upcoming large meteor showers, including the peak viewing days and moonlight conditions.   The next major meteor shower will be the Perseids, peaking in mid-August.

The Irish swimmer figures he has snapped some 500 of them in recent days since capturing gold in the 800-meter freestyle.  \u201cYeah, I actually think I\u2019m probably like one of the most famous Olympic champions,\u201d he cracked following his 1,500 free preliminary Saturday. \u201cI feel like Simone Biles.\u201d Wiffen is relishing every second of his newfound fame \u2014 and stardom certain to reach an entire other level in Ireland. Especially if he wins the 1,500 on Sunday. He made it clear he\u2019s chasing the world record, too. That mark has held for 12 years, since China\u2019s Sun Yang finished in 14 minutes, 31.02 seconds at the 2012 London Games but was later banned four years for doping. The 23-year-old Wiffen, who expects a battle from American Bobby Finke, earned the fastest qualifying time with a 14:40.34 on Saturday morning despite what he called some minor fatigue from a lack of sleep. He promised to get some rest going into the final on the last day of swimming in the Paris pool. A lanky distance specialist who wears studious specks outside the pool, Wiffen said he rarely becomes emotional.  That made him self-conscious as he teared up once the gold medal was around his neck. Wiffen had counted on contending in the 1,500 free and not necessarily the 800. \n Then, he went out Tuesday and secured Ireland\u2019s first Olympic swimming gold since 1996 at Atlanta after countrywoman Mona McSharry won bronze in the 100 breaststroke Monday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a massive step forward this week,\u201d Irish butterfly standout Max McCusker said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many semifinals and finals and now medals, so it\u2019s the best meet we\u2019ve had in the history of Ireland. Really happy moving forward and hopefully we can do that again the next cycle.\u201d  Paris Olympics Andi Manley, Wiffen\u2019s coach at Loughborough University, a public research college a couple of hours\u2019 drive or about 115 miles north of London, watched proudly as Wiffen put Irish swimming back on the world map.  The 1,500 was \u201cthe one that we came here and thought he had his best chance of winning, so to win the 800 ... is just incredible,\u201d Manley said. \u201cReally proud because the pressure of being in Lane 4 in an Olympic final, he still delivered the swim we\u2019d planned for, the perfect race.\u201d Manley made his way back to England on Wednesday, leaving the rest of the on-site preparation to Wiffen and his Irish coaches.  And those teammates and fans thrilled to see him shine. \u201cHe\u2019s a big face in Ireland now,\u201d McCusker said. \u201cHe gets a lot of it now and I think he deals with it well. He\u2019s got the personality for it. He loves it. It works well for him but I think he\u2019s just soaking it in and takes it in stride now. With so many Irish eyes smiling upon them, Wiffen and McSharry have helped erase the stigma of Michelle Smith de Bruin\u2019s scrutinized trio of golds and a bronze in Atlanta amid doping suspicions. \u201cWith history like that, it\u2019s always important to remember it,\u201d Irish swimmer Shane Ryan said after anchoring the 4x100 medley relay. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one thing that we\u2019re trying to do is just making sure that we believe in clean sport.\u201d Ireland had earned four medals \u2014 also in boxing and rowing \u2014 as of Saturday to match its total from Tokyo three years ago. Minister of Sport Thomas Byrne knows how much the Olympic success will mean not only now but for future Irish athletes. \u201cWell, look, it\u2019s just been an incredible week for Irish sport and swimming in particular because Mona McSharry started the week with her bronze medal where people were crying all over the country, she gave a very emotional interview,\u201d Byrne said at the pool Thursday night. \u201cThen of course Daniel Wiffen in his first event and he gets a gold medal which is such a huge achievement for him and for our country. We\u2019re so proud.\u201d Wiffen has become an Irish dynamo in the pool and well beyond. Once he\u2019s done at La Defense Arena he will switch gears to the 10,000-meter marathon swim scheduled for the polluted Seine River.  It has been utter madness since his 800 triumph, and there will be far more fanfare if he pulls off the remarkable distance double.  \u201cThey wait outside my building when I come out for breakfast for photos,\u201d he said. \u201c... I like it, yeah. Why not? It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Anyone famous? \u201cWho\u2019s the most famous? Oh, maybe there\u2019s famous people who have asked me, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Wiffen said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I can\u2019t remember.\u201d They all will remember him. In Ireland and beyond.

        "body": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson has been battered for months by his Democratic rival and other adversaries for seeking additional abortion restrictions beyond current state law and for past comments upbraiding women on the issue.  \u201cAbortion in this country is not about protecting the lives of mothers. It\u2019s about killing the child because you weren\u2019t responsible enough to keep your skirt down,\u201d Robinson said in a Facebook video in 2019, the year before he was elected lieutenant governor in his first bid for public office. Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the current attorney general and an abortion-rights supporter, has shown the footage in ads since June. Now Robinson is attempting to shift the broader electorate\u2019s views of him on the issue through empathy with a new commercial starting Friday that describes his wife\u2019s own abortion decades ago and leaves the impression he\u2019s comfortable with the state\u2019s current 12-week ban on most abortions.  The policy shift would be significant for Robinson, whose campaign said earlier this year that he supported an abortion ban after roughly six weeks of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Many women don\u2019t even know they are pregnant at six weeks. Previously, Robinson left the impression that he\u2019d support something even more severe, saying in 2020, for example, that \u201cfor me, there is no compromise on abortion.\u201d For decades, the GOP campaigned on restricting abortion throughout the country. But as abortion rights have driven turnout for Democrats and appeared as a vulnerability for Republicans, Robinson\u2019s approach reflects ongoing efforts by conservative politicians to appear moderate on abortion rights or avoid the topic altogether on the campaign trail \u2014 or otherwise risk losing at the ballot box in a post-Roe v. Wade world. \n The stakes are high in North Carolina, where races for statewide office are usually close affairs and the winner of this closely watched gubernatorial campaign in November could have much to say about whether the Republican-controlled General Assembly will be able to advance its conservative agenda without resistance. The campaign ad on television and on digital platforms shows Robinson and his wife Yolanda Hill holding hands. They discussed her abortion publicly in a 2022 video, but the potential audience now is much greater. \u201cThirty years ago, my wife and I made a very difficult decision. We had an abortion,\u201d Robinson says in the ad, adding that it was like a \u201csilent pain between us that we never spoke of.\u201d  What to know about the 2024 Election Hill added: \u201cIt\u2019s something that stays with me forever.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s why I stand by our current law,\u201d Robinson goes on to say, pointing to what he calls \u201ccommon-sense exceptions\u201d for pregnancies through incest and rape and when the life of the mother is in danger.  Asked Friday whether Robinson was altering his views on abortion, campaign spokesperson Mike Lonergan said that \u201cthe legislature has already spoken on this issue.\u201d  In May 2023, the Republican-controlled General Assembly enacted over Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s veto legislation that scaled back the state\u2019s ban on most abortions from after 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks.  If elected governor, Robinson \u201cwill work to make North Carolina a destination for life by building a culture that does more to support women and families, including bolstering adoption, as well as foster and childcare,\u201d Lonergan added. Stein\u2019s campaign said later Friday that the Robinson ad was the \u201clatest example of him running away from his extreme and toxic stance on abortion.\u201d Stein\u2019s team has alleged that Robinson would seek an abortion ban with no exceptions if elected. \u201cIf North Carolinians want to know where Mark Robinson really stands on abortion, they should listen to every other comment he\u2019s made on the issue before today,\u201d Stein campaign spokesperson Morgan Hopkins said. Former President Donald Trump has sought a more cautious stance on abortion rights this election by dodging questions and leaning on his go-to response that he brought abortion back to the states when he helped form the majority that overturned the constitutional right to abortion.  Abortion politics have been credited for turning back an anticipated red wave last year and delivering wins for Democrats in Kentucky\u2019s gubernatorial race and in the Virginia state legislature after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin failed to rally voters behind a proposal to ban abortions after 15 weeks with exceptions. Cooper was barred by term limits from seeking a third consecutive term but essentially handed the Democratic baton to Stein, a former state senator who once worked under Cooper when the politician was state attorney general. Hopkins said in June that Stein \u201csupports the Roe v. Wade framework of the past 50 years that protects women\u2019s reproductive freedoms and restricts abortion later in pregnancy unless a woman\u2019s life or health is at risk.\u201d  Such a framework generally allows for abortions in most cases through the point of viability, which is usually between 24 and 26 weeks of pregnancy. Robinson\u2019s campaign has alleged that Stein\u2019s views are extreme, saying that he supports abortion later in pregnancy entering the third trimester.

PARIS (AP) \u2014 Simone Biles earned her seventh Olympic gold medal by soaring to victory in the women\u2019s vault final at the Paris Games on Saturday. The 27-year-old Biles averaged 15.300 for her signature Yurchenko double pike and Cheng vaults to claim a second gold on the event eight years after she triumphed in Rio de Janeiro. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, who finished runner-up to Biles in the all-around final on Thursday, took silver, just ahead of American Jade Carey, who captured the bronze. Biles is the second woman to win vault twice, joining Vera Casalavska of Czechoslovakia as a two-time gold medalist on the vault. Casalavska went back to back in 1964 and 1968. Biles now has 10 Olympic medals in her career, tied for the third most by a female gymnast. She also boosted her medal count at major international competitions to 40, the most by any gymnast. The crowd inside a packed Bercy Arena roared when Biles was introduced. Wearing a sequined red leotard, she delivered another show-stopping performance in what could be the last vault competition of her life. She drilled her Yurchenko double pike, exploding off the block and then flipping backward twice with her hands clasped behind her knees. She landed with a big bounce \u2014 a nod to the energy she generates \u2014 with her right foot on the out-of-bounds line. The judges dinged her a tenth of a point for that. It hardly mattered. Her score of 15.700 meant she merely needed to avoid disaster on her second vault to win. Instead, she almost stuck her Cheng, which requires a roundoff onto the springboard, then a half twist onto the block followed by 1 1/2 twists while doing a forward somersault. \n The ensuing 14.900 meant the rest of the eight-woman field was going for second. Andrade, the vault champion in Tokyo, put together two excellent vaults to claim silver and her third medal of the Games after a silver in the all-around and a bronze in the team final. Andrade\u2019s average of 14.966 was well clear of everyone else. Paris Olympics Carey, who slipped during the women\u2019s vault final in Tokyo and finished eighth, earned her third Olympic medal to go with the floor exercise gold she won in Tokyo and the team gold she captured with Biles on Tuesday. Biles will have two more chances to boost her medal haul in Paris. She will compete in the balance beam and floor exercise finals on Monday.  Carlos Yulo of the Philippines competes during the men\u2019s artistic gymnastics individual floor finals at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Saturday, Aug. 3, 2024, in Paris. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco) Carlos Yulo won the second Olympic gold medal ever for the Philippines, edging defending champion Artem Dolgopyat of Israel in the men\u2019s floor exercise finals. The 24-year-old Yulo scored 15.000, just ahead of Dolgopyat, the defending champion at 14.966. Jake Jarman of Britain claimed the bronze with a 14.933. Yulo stuck his triple-twisting dismount during his final tumbling pass. He stuck his arms out and roared inside a packed Bercy Arena before walking off the podium. Yulo joins weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz as Olympic gold medalists from the Philippines. Diaz earned gold in the women\u2019s 55-kilogram division in Tokyo three years ago. The men\u2019s pommel horse final is also later Saturday. American Stephen Nedoroscik and Rhys McClenaghan of Ireland tied for the top score in qualifying.

        "body": "CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Blake Snell was one out away from pitching the first no-hit game in his illustrious career and had to get power-hitting Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz one more time. Cruz jumped on Snell\u2019s first pitch, a 97.8 mph fastball in the middle of the zone, ripping it hard to the gap in right-center field. Giants right fielder Mike Yastrzemski \u2014 inserted for defensive purposes in the eighth inning \u2014 ran it down, leaping to make the catch and preserve Snell\u2019s gem and 3-0 win. The 31-year-old lefty, the league\u2019s reigning Cy Young Award winner, was mobbed his teammates. It was third no-hitter in the majors this season. \u201cYou\u2019re so amped up in the last inning there, to be able to make that throw when you are trying to throw it as hard as you can to the plate,\u201d Snell said. \u201cI\u2019m still kind of in shock,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to go home and let it sink in. I haven\u2019t really processed the game.\u201d Snell (1-3) struck out 10 and threw 114 pitches, 78 of them strikes. He said he came into the ninth inning throwing strikes because he feared Giants manager Bob Melvin would remove him at 120 pitches. He wanted the complete game, something he\u2019d never done in 202 major league starts.  \u201cI knew in my head I had to get it over the plate,\u201d he said. It took him 10 pitches to strike out Santiago Espinal and get Jonathan India on a comebacker before De La Cruz swung at the 11th.  \n Actually, Melvin said he was ready to pull Snell if he had allowed a hit in the ninth. He was watching Snell closely because the pitcher started developing a blister around the seventh inning. \u201cThat\u2019s as nervous as I had been in a long time,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cI wanted that for him so bad. If anybody has the stuff to throw a no-hitter, it\u2019s Blake Snell.\u201d Snell was especially effective against the top of Cincinnati\u2019s order, striking out India three times, and De La Cruz and Spencer Steer twice each.  Snell recorded the 18th no-hitter in Giants\u2019 franchise history and the third in the majors this season. Houston\u2019s Ronal Blanco no-hit Toronto on April 1, and San Diego\u2019s Dylan Cease pitched a no-hitter against Washington on July 25.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be his only one,\u201d said Reds pitcher Nick Martinez, who played with Snell in San Diego last season. \u201cHe was commanding the ball very well. It seemed like he didn\u2019t miss a spot all night. He has some electric stuff.\u201d Casey Schmitt and Tyler Fitzgerald homered for the Giants on Friday. Snell threw six perfect innings against Minnesota on July 14, before the Twins\u2019 Manuel Margot singled leading off the seventh inning. He struck out 15 in his last outing on July 27, yielding two hits through six innings. He won the Cy Young Award while playing for San Diego last season after winning it in 2018 as a Tampa Bay Ray. He became the seventh player in major league history to win the award in both leagues. He signed a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants before the season. Snell became the fifth reigning Cy Young Award winner to throw a no-hitter, along with Jake Arrieta (2016), Clayton Kershaw (2014), Bob Gibson (1971) and Sandy Koufax (1964), according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The last no-hitter for the Giants was by Chris Heston on June 19, 2015, as San Francisco beat the New York Mets 5-0. The Reds were last no-hit on May 17, 2019, by Mike Fiers of the Oakland A\u2019s in a 2-0 loss. Reds starter Andrew Abbott lasted just 4 1/3 innings in Friday\u2019s game, allowing two runs and seven hits. He struck out eight.

Live updates: Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 Olympics in Paris as Simone Biles, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and Karie Ledecky compete for gold medals. \u201cWhat is going on in this context in the social media with all this hate speech, with this aggression and abuse, and fueled by this agenda, is totally unacceptable,\u201d the International Olympic Committee leader said.  Khelif of Algeria and Lin of Taiwan have been the focus of intense attention \u2014 and often inaccurate commentary \u2014 because both were disqualified at the 2023 world championships. The Russian-led International Boxing Association \u2014 which has been banished from the Olympics by the IOC in a yearslong dispute \u2014 removed the boxers from the world championships 16 months ago in India citing gender-based tests that are still unspecified and unproven. The women\u2019s boxing issue was linked by Bach to what he called a wider, Russian-led campaign against the IOC and the Paris Olympics, where only 15 Russian athletes are competing as neutrals without their national identity. The IOC and international sports bodies have isolated Russia during the military invasion of Ukraine.  \u201cWhat we have seen from the Russian side and in particular from the (IBA),\u201d Bach said, \u201cthey have undertaken already way before these Games with a defamation campaign against France, against the Games, against the IOC.\u201d  \n The Algerian Olympic and Sports Committee, in a post on Facebook, said it had filed an official complaint with the IOC to protest the online harassment of Khelif that amounts to \u201ca serious violation of sports ethics and the Olympic Charter by one of the participants in the boxing tournament.\u201d Paris Olympics The Algerian team statement alleged that another boxer \u2014 who it did not identify \u2014 posted disparaging comments on Khelif and warned that the IOC \u201chas issued a final warning to delete every post that concerns our heroine.\u201d \u201cWe reserve the right to prosecute everyone who participated in the heinous campaign against our heroine Imane Khelif,\u201d the statement said.  Khelif\u2019s opponent later Saturday was to be Anna Luc Hamori in a quarterfinals bout in the women\u2019s 66-kilogram welterweight class.  Both Khelif and Lin, who is a two-time world champion, competed at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and did not win medals.  \u201cWe have two boxers who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,\u201d Bach said. \u201cSome want to own a definition of who is a women.\u201d The IBA fueled tensions late Friday saying it would pay Angela Carini \u2014 the Italian boxer who stopped fighting against Khelif in the first minute of their bout Thursday \u2014 \u201cas if she were an Olympic champion.\u201d The IBA has promised to pay $100,000 for each boxing gold medal, with $50,000 to the boxer and shares also for their coach and national federation. \u201cEverybody in our world apparently feels obliged to say ... anything without really considering the sometimes very complex circumstances,\u201d Bach said. \u201cYou will not come to a proper decision if you organize a poll in the social media \u2018Do you think this person is a woman or is not a woman?\u2019\u201d  Boxing is the only sport at the Paris Games not being run by an IOC-recognized international governing body. The tournaments are being organized by an IOC-appointed sports unit, as they were three years ago in Tokyo, because of Olympic leaders\u2019 rift with the IBA over governance and integrity concerns, plus financial dependence on Russian state energy firm Gazprom. It has all combined to leave boxing in Paris being run by a rule book largely unchanged since the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics \u2014 a period when governing bodies for track and field, swimming and cycling have reviewed and updated their eligibility rules addressing gender issues.  Bach challenged critics of Olympic women\u2019s boxing \u201cto come up with a scientific-based new definition of who is a women, and how can somebody being born, raised and competed and having a passport as a woman cannot be considered a woman.\u201d \u2014- Associated Press writer Barbara Surk in Nice, France, contributed.

        "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The Democratic primary in Arizona\u2019s 3rd Congressional District narrowed to a margin of just 0.21 percentage points Friday, within the range of an automatic recount.  Former Phoenix City Council member Yassamin Ansari led former state lawmaker Raquel Ter\u00e1n by 89 votes, with 42,523 votes tallied and just a few hundred votes left to count. The seat is open due to Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego\u2019s run for U.S. Senate. The winner of the Democratic primary will be the favorite in the November election against Republican Jeff Zink to represent the district, which leans Democratic and covers central and southwest Phoenix. Arizona law calls for a recount if the margin is 0.5 percentage points or less. One other key congressional primary was decided Thursday when former Arizona state Rep. Amish Shah prevailed in the Democratic primary for a district covering parts of northeastern Phoenix and three affluent suburbs. That sets up a competitive November election against seven-term incumbent Republican David Schweikert. Voters delivered victories to some front-runners in Tuesday\u2019s primary election, namely former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. She defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary that headlined the election statewide and will face Democrat Ruben Gallego in November. Here\u2019s a look at some key races: \n State Rep. Justin Heap of Mesa seized on the first opportunity to unseat election officials who knocked down false claims about the 2020 and 2022 elections. He defeated both Stephen Richer, the incumbent, and information technology professor Donald Hiatt in the GOP primary for Maricopa County recorder. Richer accepted defeat in a social media post Wednesday morning and congratulated Heap.  \u201cElections have winners and, sadly, losers,\u201d Richer wrote on X. \u201cAnd in this one, it looks like I\u2019m going to end up on the losing side of the column. But that\u2019s the name of the game. Accept it. Move on.\u201d Richer took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent. He drew criticism in some conservative circles for calling out Trump and others for falsehoods about the 2020 election, which Joe Biden won in Arizona by 10,457 votes. The recorder\u2019s office runs voter registration and early voting efforts in the state\u2019s most populous county. Heap has said thousands of Republican voters don\u2019t have faith in the county\u2019s election operations. He\u2019ll face Democrat Tim Stringham, an attorney, in the Nov. 5 general election. What to know about the 2024 Election 8th District: Hamadeh, one of two Republicans endorsed by Trump, edged out Masters and four others to clinch the party\u2019s nomination in a district northwest of Phoenix. He\u2019ll have a good chance to succeed Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative.  The other candidates included former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody.  Hamadeh thanked voters, Trump, Lake and other supporters Wednesday in a social media post.  \u201cThe good guys still have a shot ... let\u2019s roll,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Masters \u2014 who also had Trump\u2019s backing in the race \u2014 urged unity behind Hamadeh. \u201cFor me, now, it\u2019s back to business, and helping in any way I can to get Donald J. Trump back in the White House,\u201d Masters said. Hamadeh, Masters and Lake campaigned together in 2022 in separate races. But the friendship between Hamadeh and Masters deteriorated after they lost. Both adopted Trump\u2019s name-calling tactics, with Hamadeh referring to Masters as \u201cThe Snake\u201d and Masters labeling Hamadeh as \u201cDishonest Abe.\u201d In November, Hamadeh will compete against Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.  1st District: Shah, a medical doctor who previously served in the Arizona Legislature, won the Democratic primary for Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District, which includes parts of north Phoenix, Scottsdale, Fountain Hills and Paradise Valley. In November, Shah will face incumbent Republican Rep. David Schweikert, who has served seven terms and breezed through the GOP primary. Biden won the district in 2020. Schweikert\u2019s reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.  The other candidates who ran in the Democratic primary were Andrei Cherny, a former state party chair; ex-news anchor Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Wood; orthodontist Andrew Horne; former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer; and investment banker Conor O\u2019Callaghan.  Schweikert defeated businessman Robert Backie and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George. 3rd District: In the Democratic primary, Ansari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \u201cstand up to MAGA extremism\u201d and defend abortion rights.  Ter\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff\u2019s post. Zink, who claimed Biden\u2019s victory in 2020 was stolen, defeated Jesus David Mendoza to win the Republican nomination.  Senate District 2: State Sen. Shawnna Bolick won the Republican primary, fending off a challenge from a small business owner who leans further to the right. Bolick was appointed to the northwest Phoenix seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity was tested Tuesday, months after she sided with Democrats in repealing an 1864 near-total ban on abortions. In November, Bolick will face state Rep. Judy Schwiebert, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. Senate District 7: State Sen. Wendy Rogers kept her status as incumbent in the race for a seat that represents a vast district including Flagstaff, and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she\u2019s popular with her base and has a national following. Her primary opponent, state Rep. David Cook, had criticized her for not focusing on more local issues like mining and water. Rogers\u2019 Democratic challenger in the November election is Haley Creighton. Senate District 1: Former state Rep. Mark Finchem, a fierce Trump loyalist, defeated incumbent state Sen. Ken Bennett for the GOP nomination in the reliably red district anchored by Prescott. Finchem was a prolific proponent of the lie that former President Donald Trump lost his 2020 reelection because of widespread fraud, which has been repeatedly debunked by courts, election experts and Trump\u2019s own attorney general. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, represented the more moderate choice for voters. A third candidate, real estate broker Steve Zipperman, trailed. Voters will choose between Finchem and Democrat Mike Fogel in the general election. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Haley Creighton will face Wendy Rogers in November, not David Cook."

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday overrode a plea agreement reached earlier this week for the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and two other defendants, reinstating them as death-penalty cases. The move comes two days after the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, announced that the official appointed to oversee the war court, retired Brig. Gen. Susan Escallier, had approved plea deals with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two accused accomplices, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, in the attacks. Letters sent to families of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the al-Qaida attacks said the plea agreement stipulated the three would serve life sentences at most. Austin wrote in an order released Friday night that \u201cin light of the significance of the decision,\u201d he had decided that the authority to make a decision on accepting the plea agreements was his. He nullified Escallier\u2019s approval. Some families of the attack\u2019s victims condemned the deal for cutting off any possibility of full trials and possible death penalties. Republicans were quick to fault the Biden administration for the deal, although the White House said after it was announced it had no knowledge of it. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a member of the Armed Services Committee, earlier Friday had condemned the plea deal on social media as \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d Cotton said he had introduced legislation that would mandate the 9/11 defendants face trial and the possibility of the death penalty. \n Mohammed, whom the U.S. describes as the main plotter of the attack that crashed hijacked passenger planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, and the other two defendants had been expected to formally enter their pleas under the deal as soon as next week. The U.S. military commission overseeing the cases of five defendants in the Sept. 11 attacks has been stuck in pre-trial hearings and other preliminary court action since 2008. The torture that the defendants underwent while in CIA custody has been among the challenges slowing the cases, and left the prospect of full trials and verdicts still uncertain, in part because of the inadmissibility of evidence linked to the torture. J. Wells Dixon, a staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights who has represented defendants at Guantanamo as well as other detainees there who have been cleared of any wrongdoing, had welcomed the plea bargains as the only feasible way to resolve the long-stalled and legally fraught 9/11 cases.  Dixon accused Austin on Friday of \u201cbowing to political pressure and pushing some victim family members over an emotional cliff\u201d by rescinding the plea deals. Lawyers for the two sides have been exploring a negotiated resolution to the case for about 1 1/2 years. President Joe Biden blocked an earlier proposed plea bargain in the case last year, when he refused to offer requested presidential guarantees that the men would be spared solitary confinement and provided trauma care for the torture they underwent while in CIA custody. A fourth Sept. 11 defendant at Guantanamo had been still negotiating on a possible plea agreement.  The military commission last year ruled the fifth defendant mentally unfit to stand trial. A military medical panel cited post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis, and linked it to torture and solitary confinement in four years in CIA custody before transfer to Guantanamo. \u2014- Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed."

        "body": "GARHMUKTESHWAR, India (AP) \u2014 They were found in gutters, on streets, in bushes. They were boarded on trains, deserted in hospitals, dumped at temples. They were sent away for being sick or outliving paychecks or simply growing too old. By the time they reached this home for the aged and unwanted, many were too numb to speak. Some took months to mouth the truth of how they came to spend their final days in exile. \u201cThey said, \u2018Taking care of him is not our cup of tea,\u2019\u201d says Amirchand Sharma, 65, a retired policeman whose sons left him to die near the river after he was badly hurt in an accident. \u201cThey said, \u2018Throw him away.\u2019\u201d In its traditions, in its religious tenets and in its laws, India has long cemented the belief that it is a child\u2019s duty to care for his aging parents. But in a land known for revering its elderly, a secret shame has emerged: A burgeoning population of older people abandoned by their own families. A resident walks past a mural at SHEOWS\u2019 Garhmukteshwar shelter. (AP Photo/David Goldman) This is a country where grandparents routinely share a roof with children and grandchildren, and where the expectation that the young care for the old is so ingrained in the national ethos that nursing homes are a relative rarity and hiring caregivers is often seen as taboo. But expanding lifespans have brought ballooning caregiving pressure, a wave of urbanization has driven many young far from their home villages and a creeping Western influence has begun eroding the tradition of multigenerational living. \n Courtrooms swell with thousands of cases of parents seeking help from their children. Footpaths and alleys are crowded with older people who now call them home. And a cottage industry of nonprofits for the abandoned has sprouted, operating a constantly growing number of shelters that continually fill. This is one of them.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) The Saint Hardyal Educational and Orphans Welfare Society, known as SHEOWS, houses about 320 people on 16 acres of land in this small north Indian city. Nearly all of them were abandoned by their families. One woman spent more than eight years living at a faraway temple where she was deserted by her children. Another tells of a son she loved who forced her out, saying if she didn\u2019t leave, his wife would. A man sitting atop a bed with sheets adorned with teddy bears and smiling anthropomorphic mushrooms was left to die on the street, arriving here so starved that he ate 22 rotis, one after another after another. Birbati, the lead caregiver in the women\u2019s building, who does not use a surname, says after years of tending to the abandoned, she finds some of them visiting in her dreams. \u201cEach of them has a story,\u201d she says. \u201cAll are sad stories.\u201d Residents begin their day with yoga at the Garhmukteshwar shelter. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Wealthy countries have grappled with aging societies for decades, but the issue is only now beginning to ripple in the developing world, where the idea of growing old is still new for swaths of the population.  By 2050, two-thirds of the world\u2019s population of people 60 and older will reside outside the world\u2019s wealthiest nations. India is projected to see growth among its old that far outstrips that of the young. Already, the curses of that demographic shift have begun to emerge alongside its blessings. An Indian born just 70 years ago was forecast to live nearly half as long as one today. But longer lives have often brought with them greater medical need and thrust the next generation into economic binds that force them to balance the needs of their parents with the needs of their own children. By tradition, Indian parents live with a son, who is responsible for their care, though in practice, the work typically falls to women. That remains the norm, but a growing number of older Indians now have absentee children and inadequate help to keep up with expenses or care. Others feel forced to leave homes where toxic feuds fester. And, in the very worst cases, parents are ousted from their home by a child in a dispute over money or in a wits-end solution to incontinence they can\u2019t stomach or dementia they can\u2019t handle. This is the first in a series of stories from the AP about aging in the developing world. Driven from their homes, these elders end up begging on the streets or, if they\u2019re lucky, in a shelter like this, where separate buildings for men and women overlook a sun-soaked lawn with towering palms and a fountain ringed by rose bushes. Monkeys crisscross the roof of an on-site hospital while inside, in its small physical therapy room, a doctor tries to coax a patient\u2019s arthritic knees to work. The patient, Rajhu Phooljale, has his black pants rolled up, and around his right ankle, he has tied black thread to ward off evil. He says he is 65, but like many older Indians, isn\u2019t entirely certain of his age. Rajhu Phooljale, 65, weeps while recalling his story of abandonment as he\u2019s comforted by Dr. Salim Ahamad, right, and manager Naved Khan at the shelter in Garhmukteshwar. (AP Photo/David Goldman) How he ended up here, though, he can\u2019t forget. Phooljale was working as a cook and living with his wife and two adult sons when he was hit by a motorist and left initially unable to walk and permanently blinded. He could not work. His wife left him. His sons told him they arranged for surgery in New Delhi, far from their home in the country\u2019s center, and when they arrived at the hospital, they told him to sit while they went off to consult a doctor. \u201cWait here,\u201d they said. But they never returned. For two or three days, Phooljale stayed on the grounds of a hospital in a strange city in a world that, for a man newly blind, had just gone black. He went hungry and thirsty and broke down in tears. A hospital staffer eventually called the police, who in turn alerted SHEOWS, which picked him up. It has been about two years since then and Phooljale has not heard anything from his sons. He doesn\u2019t even have a photograph of them. He wonders if they think he is dead. \u201cI nurtured them from the time they were small,\u201d he says. \u201cIsn\u2019t it their duty to take care of me?\u201d He clutches the side of his head and sobs as he speaks. Through the window of the therapy room is a hospital ward full of patients with similar stories and, outside, there are two more buildings with hundreds more. The scene repeats at three other sites run by SHEOWS and the constellation of other organizations\u2019 shelters dotting this vast subcontinent. Avanish Kumar, left, and Rinku Semar approach a man named Atmaram who is living on the street to offer transporting him to the SHEOWS, a home for the aged and unwanted in New Delhi. (AP Photo/David Goldman) In New Delhi, about 60 miles and a world away from the dirt roads of Garhmukteshwar, a two-man SHEOWS crew inches an ambulance through the capital\u2019s choked thoroughfares, where cows amble beside clusters of tuk-tuks and vendors pile their carts high with perfectly stacked fruit. On streets overflowing with humanity, there is no shortage of heartache and, with traffic snarled, the men study the streets\u2019 edges looking for signs of someone old and in need. They pull over to check on a shoeless man with a torn shirt lying on the side of the road, and another man who is sitting at the riverbank with all his belongings stuffed in two rice bags. \u201cDo you have a son?\u201d asks the ambulance\u2019s driver, Rinku Semar. \u201cDo you have a daughter?\u201d Some approached by Semar and his partner, Avanish Kumar, refuse to go with them. Others appear drunk or drugged and are disqualified from being taken to one of SHEOWS\u2019 shelters. As an orange sun descends in a hazy sky, they pick up a man named Atmaram whose jeans and shirt are worn and dirty and who drags a sack with a blanket and his other belongings. Inside the ambulance, flashes of red and blue strobes ricochet and the siren buffets a nearby mosque\u2019s blaring call to prayer. Atmaram doesn\u2019t use a surname and doesn\u2019t know his age. A few white hairs sprout from his nearly bald head, his left eye is clouded by cataracts and most of his teeth are gone. In India \u2014 a land known for revering its elderly \u2014 a growing number of older people are being abandoned by their own families. (AP Video: David Goldman, Matt Sedensky, Martha Irvine) The ambulance arrives at SHEOWS\u2019 newest shelter, where seesaws and swings hint at the property\u2019s former life as a school. Atmaram is shown to a shower, where the pool of water beneath him turns brown as a caregiver scrubs his legs with a pink bar of soap. Both men are silent. The stories of the abandoned are often incomplete, riddled with holes punched by time, their reticence and, sometimes, the fog of dementia. Atmaram is no different and, this night, has no explanation for why he was living on the street. Basic questions, such as whether he has any children, are unanswered. Some clues drip out in the days to come: He used to make clay pots. He and his brother shared a home with their respective wives. His wife died, then his brother. Then, his sister-in-law forced him out. \u201cThis house is not yours,\u201d he says she told him. Atmaram eats at the New Delhi shelter. (AP Photo/David Goldman) His shower is done and Atmaram is given fresh clothes and served a hot meal on a metal tray before being shown to a bed in a communal room. The shelter\u2019s staff has repeated this routine many times but none utters what they know to be true: Few who arrive here will ever see their families again. \u201cThey say, \u2018He\u2019ll come back one day,\u2019\u201d says Saurabh Bhagat, the 35-year-old leader of SHEOWS, the organization his father founded. \u201cBut almost none of them ever come back.\u201d The scars from an infestation of maggots are seen on the leg of Sikander, whose age is unknown, as he lays on his bed at the Garhmukteshwar shelter. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Though most who are taken in by SHEOWS come from New Delhi\u2019s streets and spend time in one of the organization\u2019s city shelters, in time most end up here, at its largest site in Garhmukteshwar. The center\u2019s staffers are a stand-in for absent families and are quick with a caring touch or extra helping of food. And as caregivers\u2019 years here pass, each amasses memories of cases that haunt them. The old man whose leg was so infested with maggots he spent a month hospitalized. The woman who looked like a skeleton when she was found shivering in the bushes on a winter day that would be her last. A man with dementia often seen crying but unable to say why. \u201cHow can children do this?\u201d the home\u2019s manager, 30-year-old Naved Khan, asks in disbelief. Each who comes here has a different answer, but similarities emerge. Again and again, they tell of being turned away when their needs grew too great, when finances got too tight or when the strife of a packed house was too much to bear. Men outnumber women. Many are in declining health. Dementia and mental illness are common. Most have outlived their spouse, a crucial line of protection. Shushila Jain, who is about 80, pushes a plastic chair as a makeshift walker and, looking around the room at so many others like her, believes they are living in what Hindus call Kali Yuga, the worst of times, a period marked by conflict and cataclysm. She raised two sons and two daughters and cared for her husband and in-laws and three grandsons, too. But no one reciprocated as her own needs grew. Shushila Jain, who is about 80, sits on her bed at the Garhmukteshwar shelter. (AP Photo/David Goldman) \u201cI never thought it would come to this,\u201d she says. Bhagat\u2019s father, Girdhar Prasad Bhagat, started SHEOWS two decades ago when he began seeing India\u2019s cherished traditions flouted and elderly people left in New Delhi\u2019s streets. He\u2019d heard of people abandoning their parents before, most notably in the northern city of Vrindavan. For hundreds of years, its serpentine maze of temple-lined streets and alleys have drawn widows whose families abandoned them after the death of their husbands left them branded as purveyors of bad luck. As the elder Bhagat moved through New Delhi\u2019s streets, though, he saw something new. A problem that was once concentrated in a single place, driven by religious and cultural issues on society\u2019s edges, was now finding a foothold among a broader cross-section of people in a much wider swath of the country. SHEOWS has taken in 10,000 people since its founding, but there is no reliable tally of India\u2019s total population of abandoned elders. In cities across the country, organizations that care for the abandoned say a simmering decades-old problem has grown far worse in recent years. SHEOWS opened a second shelter, then a third, then a fourth. Similar organizations have done the same, some with the backing of billionaire philanthropists like Azim Premji and MacKenzie Scott.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) The problem has only continued to grow. It comes even as India, now the world\u2019s most populous country, has experienced decades of phenomenal growth in which billionaires were made but inequities also deepened. The backgrounds of many here might be surprising, including academics, businesspeople and professionals. SHEOWS residents are more likely to hail from middle-class families than poor ones. Still, economics are a major driver of abandonment. Most older people in India do not receive a pension, government assistance or health insurance and families are often looked to for support. Annapurna Devi Pandey, an anthropologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, whose research has taken her to homes for the abandoned in her native India, says respect for elders remains ingrained in society, but some must make a difficult choice between caring for their children or their parents. \u201cThe sense of duty,\u201d she says, \u201cbecomes kind of an existential issue.\u201d The body of a resident named Yadagiri is prepared for cremation in Hyderabad.

Mustan, left, who goes by one name, helps lead fe Parliament passed the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act in 2007 to ensure grown children and grandchildren provide for their aged relatives. India\u2019s Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, which oversees the law, has not released data on the number of claims it has received. One mid-sized state, Kerala, said in 2022 that its dozens of tribunals had processed some 20,000 cases since the law\u2019s passage, a microcosm of the national total. Surveys show the vast majority of seniors are completely unaware of their rights under the maintenance act. Even if they do know, many are unlikely to take their kin to court. Bhagat, the leader of SHEOWS, says he\u2019s not aware of a single resident of his shelters who has pursued a case. Many concede their fates and remain protective of the children that have deserted them. Resident Vijaya Lakshmi, 85, walks through a courtyard at the Garhmukteshwar shelter. (AP Photo/David Goldman) A feeling of acceptance is pervasive here. Those who call this home may have been cast away by their families, but they have been saved from the streets. Comfort comes with the rhythm of reliable meals and afternoon teas and their own quiet prayers. Castes disappear and friendships bloom. More striking than the gravity of the stories or the weight of the sorrows is the warmth residents exude. Wide smiles spread across weathered faces as hands are pressed together in a sign of welcome or placed on a visitor\u2019s head, gently mussing their hair to extend a blessing. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t miss their families,\u201d Bhagat says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve seen a lot of broken people heal over time.\u201d Most who arrive here end up staying several years. Some have been here since it opened. Tucked in one corner of the center\u2019s hospital are piles of folders, one for each resident, stashed in cubbies. Each amounts to an individual\u2019s history here, beginning with where they were found. A woman dumped at a Sikh gurdwara. A man lying in the street. A woman left at a police station. One pile of folders is of those whose son or daughter came back for them, filled out paperwork for their release and pressed a purple thumbprint on it to make it official. But far more files grow fat and tattered until one final insertion is made, a thin strip of grid paper with the flat lines of an EKG. It is left unsaid when someone arrives here: More than likely, this is the place they will die. When it happens, caregivers bathe and dress the dead, then take the body to the river, where they rub it in ghee and set it aflame. No family will come to mourn them and no words of remembrance are spoken. A bed is freed and, soon, a new resident arrives. A wheelchair in a room at a Second Chance Foundation shelter in Hyderabad.

        "body": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Mariners center fielder Julio Rodr\u00edguez has started running in his recovery from a high-ankle sprain, but the team is still uncertain about the timeline for when their young star could return to the lineup. General manager Justin Hollander said Friday that Rodr\u00edguez had started \u201clinear running\u201d and that he was recovering at \u201ca high rate of speed.\u201d Hollander said the nature of the injury makes it difficult to know when Rodr\u00edguez will be ready to start doing the cutting and lateral movements that he\u2019ll ultimately need to return to Seattle\u2019s lineup. \u201cJulio is generally a fast healer and is younger, faster and stronger than almost anyone in the world so he is pushing it as much as he can. I know he wants to get back here,\u201d Hollander said. Rodr\u00edguez suffered the ankle injury on July 21 when he crashed into the center field wall attempting to make a catch. The update on Rodr\u00edguez came the same day Seattle placed reliever Gregory Santos on the 15-day injured list due to biceps inflammation, but with the hope it will be a brief absence. Santos left the mound in the middle of the eighth inning on Wednesday after feeing discomfort in the arm.  Seattle also claimed right-hander Jonathan Hern\u00e1ndez off waivers from Texas and designated for assignment right-hander Brett de Geus. Hern\u00e1ndez was 3-1 with a 5.05 ERA in 26 games this season for the Rangers. He was designated for assignment by Texas on Tuesday. \n Another uncertain timeline for Seattle is shortstop J.P. Crawford, who was out taking ground balls before Friday\u2019s game as he continues to recover from a broken pinky on his right hand. Hollander said Crawford would have another set of X-rays taken on Monday, but he won\u2019t begin any progression in his baseball activities until Aug. 19, at the earliest. \u201cThat will be four weeks. That\u2019s pretty aggressive, but that would be the absolute soonest. It just depends on what kind of healing we see,\u201d Hollander said. Outfielder Dominic Canzone (adductor) began a rehab assignment at Triple-A Tacoma on Thursday. Hollander said there is a chance he could be activated during this homestand.

        "body": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) \u2014 Vietnamese President To Lam was confirmed Saturday as the new chief of the Communist Party after his predecessor died July 19. Lam will be the general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the country\u2019s most powerful political role, state media said. It was unclear if Lam will stay in his role as president. The previous general secretary, Nguyen Phu Trong, dominated Vietnamese politics since he became party chief in 2011. He was elected to a third term as general secretary in 2021. He was an ideologue who viewed corruption as the gravest threat facing the party. In his first speech as the Communist Party chief, Lam said that him taking the reigns was because of \u201can urgent need to ensure the leadership of the party.\u201d Lam said he would maintain the legacies of his predecessor, notably the anti-corruption campaign that has rocked the country\u2019s political and business elites and a pragmatic approach to foreign policy known as bamboo diplomacy \u2014 a phrase coined by Trong referring to the plant\u2019s flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of global geopolitics. Lam spent over four decades in the Ministry of Public Security before becoming the minister in 2016. As Vietnam\u2019s top security official, Lam led Trong\u2019s sweeping anti-graft campaign until May, when he became president following the resignation of his predecessor, who stepped down after being caught by the campaign. Big changes in Vietnam\u2019s strategic approach are unlikely, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute, but Lam\u2019s relative newness to governing meant that it remains to be seen how he will lead. \n Given the current composition of the upper echelons of Vietnamese politics, Giang said it was possible that Lam\u2019s promotion could mean an end to the internal fighting that has rocked the party for several years. \u201cTo Lam is the new unchallenged power who will dominate Vietnamese politics in the years, if not a decade, ahead,\u201d he said. Giang said the party will vote for the general secretary again in 2026, and Lam\u2019s performance will be a factor.  \u201cFor now, however, it seems a new era has come,\u201d he said."

        "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) \u2014 Bobby Kersee was in a taxi to the airport the night his current prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, broke the world record in the 400-meter hurdles at the U.S. Olympic trials. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen one of Sydney\u2019s world records live yet,\u201d Kersee says. Once his athletes step on the track, Kersee considers his work done, and he quietly slips away from the stadium. All perfectly fitting for the \u201cmad scientist\u201d \u2014 a coach whose presence at any of the world\u2019s major track meets, including the Paris Olympics, is enormous whether he\u2019s watching the action or not. Many of America\u2019s biggest track stars \u2014 Florence Griffith Joyner, Gail Devers, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Al Joyner, Allyson Felix and, these days, Athing Mu and McLaughlin-Levrone \u2014 have one thing in common: coached by Kersee.  \u201cBobby is the best ever,\u201d said Al Joyner, who won the triple jump at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. \u201cBecause Bobby brings out the best in you. At the same time, he\u2019s not a hold-your-hand coach.\u201d After the Paris Games end, the 70-year-old Kersee will have coached athletes in 12 Olympics and 47 U.S. championships. Those athletes have taken home at least one gold medal from every Olympics since the 1984 Summer Games. McLaughlin-Levrone is a favorite to keep that streak going in the 400-meter hurdles final on Aug. 8.  The method to Kersee\u2019s madness?  He\u2019ll never give away the Xs and Os, but during a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, he, at different times, compared his job to that of a baker, a chemist, a woodworker and a psychologist. \n \u201cIf I can\u2019t explain to them in detail why I want it done this way, and what the end result is going to be, then you shouldn\u2019t trust in me,\u201d Kersee said. \u201cBecause those that know the \u2018why\u2019 can beat those that know the \u2018how.\u2019\u201d McLaughlin-Levrone had already been to an Olympics at age 16 and had her career was on a fast track. But after losing a pair of races in 2019 to Dalilah Muhammad, who broke world records both times, she became frustrated.  Paris Olympics One obvious fix was to see if Kersee would coach her.  It\u2019s a decision that changed history \u2014 both for McLaughlin-Levrone and for track. A record that stood at 52.34 seconds for nearly 16 years before Muhammad broke it now belongs to McLaughlin-Levrone at 50.65. Many think sub-50 will come soon \u2014 maybe in this year\u2019s Olympic final. \u201cGrowing as a person and as an athlete, he challenges me and pushes me in ways I didn\u2019t think were possible,\u201d McLaughlin-Levrone said.  At the practice track he calls his \u201clab,\u201d Kersee has turned McLaughlin-Levrone into arguably the most indomitable force in track.  Yet, after she had lowered the record in the 400 hurdles for the fourth time in 2022, she became nearly invisible in her best event for two years. She raced in regular sprints at 200 and 400 meters and also in the short hurdles \u2014 100 meters, and 60 meters indoors.  All of that wasn\u2019t meant to prepare McLaughlin-Levrone for another event at the Olympics. Instead, it made her even better at her best event. \u201cWhen she started running the short hurdles, everyone started freaking out,\u201d hurdling great Edwin Moses said. \u201cAll she was doing was learning how to perfect jumping off the opposite leg. Bobby knew what he was doing.\u201d Taking a cue from her coach, McLaughlin said she treats every race like a heavyweight bout. She views the hurdles as Joe Frazier and herself as Muhammad Ali. It\u2019s one of the many sports metaphors Kersee embeds in his runners\u2019 minds.  He\u2019s a diehard New York Yankees fan. He also watches NASCAR races and loved watching Dale Earnhardt navigate turns. Kersee doesn\u2019t limit his coaching to track athletes. He has worked with hockey greats Brett Hull and Grant Fuhr, and with NFL hall of famers Ty Law, Jerome Bettis and Marshall Faulk. If life would have turned out exactly the way he planned, Kersee would have become the first Black NFL coach in the league\u2019s modern era (That distinction belongs to Art Shell). Instead, at the behest of his sisters, he ended up becoming a track coach, and he looked for tips wherever he went. \u201c(My high school biology teacher) told me, \u2018If you want to be a coach, learn the body from the inside out,\u2019\u201d Kersee said. So he did. He taught with heart. He made them believe. His training group \u2014 called Formula Kersee \u2014 had some recent fun on Instagram. Athletes were asked to offer one go-to line that Kersee always uses: \u2014 \u201cGive me what you got!\u201d McLaughlin-Levrone deadpanned. \u2014 \u201cAll right, now,\u201d Mu said. \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 40 years. I know what I\u2019m doing now,\u201d sprinter Chloe Abbott said. After the \u201880s and \u201990s highlighted by Flo-Jo (who still holds the world records in the 100 and 200), Joyner-Kersee (Who Kersee married in 1986, then coached to three Olympic gold medals over the next six years), and Devers (Olympic champion in the 100 in \u201892 and \u201996) \u2014 came Allyson Felix. Felix retired in 2022 as the most decorated track and field athlete in history, with 20 world championship medals and 11 more at the Olympics, including seven golds. Rarely, when discussing the secret to her success. would the words \u201cBobby always tells me ...\u201d not start the conversation. \u201cIf he tells you to do something, you believe it,\u201d Felix said. \u201cAs hard as he is on his athletes, he\u2019s a very compassionate person. I remember countless times, I didn\u2019t even tell him there was something going on in my life, and he just shows up for you. He came to my grandma\u2019s funeral. He just cares about you.\u201d Kersee rarely stuck around to watch Felix win most of her medals, either. He was usually back at the hotel or somewhere outside the stadium.  Kersee developed his habit of not watching races at the 1984 Olympics when his athletes \u2014 Jeanette Bolden and Alice Brown in the 100 and Flo-Jo and Valerie Brisco-Hooks in the 200 \u2014 were going head-to-head in the finals. \u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t sit here and cheer,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I just go across the street and wait for the race to be over, then come back and hear what the results are.\u201d Eventually, he started leaving the track and not returning. He has no plans to be in the Stade de France when McLaughlin-Levrone runs. The results of his coaching have always shown up on the stopwatch, then the scoreboard \u2014 then, ultimately, on the medals stand and in the history books. Devers recalled riding a bus to the stadium in 1992 in Barcelona and seeing Kersee on the street arguing with police. \u201cWe get to the track and we start warming up,\u201d Devers said. \u201cIt\u2019s been like an hour, two hours, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Aren\u2019t you guys concerned?\u2019 Our comment was, \u2018Hopefully, if they take Bobby to jail, they\u2019ve got a TV so he can watch us win.\u2019\u201d One longstanding criticism has been that Kersee doesn\u2019t race his athletes enough. He said it boils down to making sure everyone is at their best at the biggest meets.  Mu, the defending Olympic 800-meter champion, was dealing with a torn hamstring leading into this year\u2019s Olympic trials. Kersee kept her off the track all season. When she finally appeared, she was tripped in the finals and didn\u2019t earn her spot. Some thought Mu would land on the U.S. relay 4x400 relay team, as she had three years ago in Tokyo. Kersee didn\u2019t press that issue, either, calling it a matter of fairness to other athletes, and common sense for Mu. \u201cTo be honest, I would have to change her training to get more speed out of her, and in order to do that, then I\u2019m maybe endangering her in trying to get her faster too early, to run a relay,\u201d Kersee said.  Ask the coach what the secret is to his success, and he\u2019ll talk about cake. \u201cA cake is a cake but there\u2019s a different flavor in each cake,\u201d Kersee explained. \u201cIt\u2019s finding the formula for the right flavor in order to give that athlete the right taste they desire.\u201d He\u2019ll talk about putting on his lab coat and getting to work. \u201cIf it\u2019s to call it a \u2018mad scientist,\u2019 so be it,\u201d he said.  He\u2019ll talk about one of his favorite hobbies \u2014 restoring furniture. Unplugging from the track now and then allows him to sometimes discover things in an unpolished athlete \u2014 or an imperfect piece of wood \u2014 that others might not. \u201cWhen you see me on the track, you see me on the track,\u201d he said. \u201cBut off the track, I like working with my hands. As a coach, I\u2019ve learned you have to turn that switch off.\u201d What brings it all together? He will not divulge that secret. \u201cNow why would I tell you that part of the recipe when we\u2019re still racing?\u201d Kersee said. \u201cThe cake is still rising. I can\u2019t give you that yet.\u201d AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"

For the first 30 minutes of the two-hour meeting, these coworkers reveal hopes and anxieties \u2014 what they worry about, what they\u2019re grateful for, what they\u2019re feeling. Even at a company focused on connecting people, forging real relationships in the workplace takes effort, Hinge CEO Justin McLeod told an audience at the South by Southwest conference earlier this year. He was co-presenting at the event with Ann Shoket, whose initiative to combat workplace loneliness is called \u201c10 Minutes to Togetherness.\u201d As America navigates what Surgeon General Vivek Murthy described last year as a loneliness epidemic, employers and employees across the country are trying to address what for many people is a lack of real friendships at work. The problem of loneliness has been bubbling for decades; Robert D. Putnam documented it in his groundbreaking book \u201cBowling Alone\u201d nearly a quarter-century ago. Remote work has only intensified the problem, for extroverts and introverts alike, says leadership expert Michael Bungay Stanier, author of \u201cHow to Work with (Almost) Anyone.\u201d \u201cPeople have this desire to be seen and be heard,\u201d Bungay Stanier says, but on video calls, the group gets right to the business at hand rather than having the natural, informal interactions of a real room. It reduces people to \u201clittle heads in squares.\u201d This article is part of AP\u2019s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. It\u2019s not easy to talk about this lack of friendship at work \u201cbecause it feels like a shameful confession,\u201d Bungay Stanier says. But his clients are beginning to bring up the subject. \n Awkward as it may be, these are conversations worth having, according to psychology professor Laurie Santos, creator of Yale University\u2019s well-known class \u201cThe Science of Well Being.\u201d In her own presentation at South by Southwest earlier this year, Santos cited research that showed workplace friendships and a sense of belonging are vital to employees\u2019 happiness \u2013- and companies\u2019 success. We assume that friendships at work are \u201ca nice-to-have, not a need-to-have,\u201d she said. But \u201cmaybe one of the reasons we\u2019re all so disengaged at work, maybe one of the reasons \u2018quiet quitting\u2019 seems so appealing, is that we\u2019re actively not investing in the thing that might matter the most for our happiness at work, which is our connection with other people,\u201d Santos said. Some large companies began paying more attention to employee health long before the pandemic, often focusing on the physical: adding a gym to the office building or serving healthier food in the cafeteria.  Today, more employers \u201care not just checking boxes, but actually looking at ways to really enhance people\u2019s health and well-being,\u201d says Suzanne Heidelberger, who has led teams managing real-estate properties for global companies including American Express and Fidelity Investments. She focuses on bringing a hospitality mindset to corporate spaces. For example, employers might: \u2014 Rethink physical spaces with relationships in mind, she says. Some companies are adding staircases, both to help people get more steps and to encourage the \u201ccasual collisions\u201d that can lead to good relationships. Some are trying to transform green rooftops \u2014 created to be environmentally friendly \u2014 into gathering spaces. \u2014 Create groups and events to help employees find friends who share their interests. \u201cIt could even be something goofy, like an ice cream social for dog lovers, where we\u2019re going to teach you how to make healthy ice cream for your dog,\u201d Heidelberger says. \u2014 Offer online gatherings as well. During the pandemic, American Express offered online cooking classes that helped employees feel connected and introduced them to coworkers.  Employees are also seeking answers on their own, notes executive coach Daniel Boscaljon, founder of the Healthy Relationship Academy, which helps organizations build better workplaces. It\u2019s not always easy: As much as people crave relationships, he says, many lack strong interpersonal skills.  \u201cWhen you meet somebody with good relationship skills, a lot of times it\u2019s like magic,\u201d Boscaljon says. \u201cPeople open up, they\u2019ll start to talk, they\u2019ll feel comfortable. Then, sometimes, they\u2019ll have kind of a \u2018vulnerability hangover,\u2019 where they\u2019re like, \u2018I was too open there. What just happened?\u2019 \u2026 People are so unused to it.\u201d One key, he says, is to work on one\u2019s own well-being. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a work personality and a home personality,\u201d he says. \u201cWho you are as a whole person shows up in every place that you\u2019re in.\u201d Another strategy, according to Bungay Stanier, is to communicate with coworkers about how you can best work together before you dive into a project.  \u201cWe\u2019ve all got our small little habits and preferences,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we assume what\u2019s normal for us is normal for everyone.\u201d Raising issues beforehand helps you \u201cavoid making small rips in the fabric of a relationship\u201d that keep people from becoming friends, Bungay Stanier says. Those inevitable rips are also worth discussing. \u201cThe relationships that thrive are ones that get repaired,\u201d he says. More than anything, remember the importance of everyday greetings at work \u2014 even if they make you a bit uncomfortable. A simple hello, Bungay Stanier says, could be the beginning of the end of loneliness."

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Justice Department remains committed to sharing with social media companies information that it picks up about efforts by foreign governments to influence this year\u2019s elections, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told a lawyers\u2019 conference on Friday. Speaking at the American Bar Association\u2019s annual meeting, Monaco, the department\u2019s No. 2 official, said that though it\u2019s ultimately up to technology companies to decide what if any action to take, \u201cWe will provide companies with actionable intelligence so they can make decisions regarding abuse on their platforms by adversaries conducting foreign malign influence operations, including targeting our elections.\u201d The comments were part of a wide-ranging speech on election security in which Monaco also warned that Russia remains the primary foreign threat to elections, with Moscow targeting specific voting demographics and using encrypted direct-messaging apps to reach Americans, and sound an alarm about a rising threat of violence to public officials \u2014 including election workers. The Justice Department in the last two years has prosecuted nearly 700 threat cases, more than half of which involved public officials. \u201cThese threats are unacceptable. No one \u2014 no one \u2014 should endure threats of violence simply for doing their job,\u201d Monaco said. \u201cFor the right to vote to be real for every American, election workers \u2014 who are often, after all, volunteers \u2014 must be able to do their jobs free from improper influence, physical threats, or any other conduct designed to intimidate.\u201d \n The speech was given at the ABA\u2019s Democracy Summit in Chicago, with Monaco reminding the audience of lawyers of their obligation to uphold the rule of law and promote faith in election integrity. \u201cOur republic depends on the operation of a free and fair electoral process \u2014 with results that are respected and with elections that are free from violence and free from foreign interference,\u201d Monaco said. Monaco\u2019s remarks come weeks after a Supreme Court ruling that permitted the federal government to interact with social media companies, with the justices ruling against Republican-led states who claimed federal officials leaned on the platforms to unconstitutionally squelch conservative points of view. The court said the states and other parties did not have the legal right, or standing, to sue. The department this week also made public for the first time a series of procedures the FBI uses for deciding when to share information with social media companies about threats to their platforms. That step was encouraged in a recent report by the Justice Department inspector general. \u201cAs we carry out this work, we will continue to keep the public updated not only about why we are doing it but also how\u201d Monaco said. Under the procedures, the FBI may be in touch with companies when it identifies activities on a platform being conducted by, or on behalf of, a foreign government to support an influence operation or if there are specific and credible facts showing the activity can be attributed to a foreign government.  The procedures state that the FBI must make clear that it is not asking the social media company to take any action and that the company is under no obligation to do so."

        "body": "The Justice Department sued TikTok on Friday, accusing the company of violating children\u2019s online privacy law and running afoul of a settlement it had reached with another federal agency.  The complaint, filed together with the Federal Trade Commission in a California federal court, comes as the U.S. and the prominent social media company are embroiled in yet another legal battle that will determine if \u2013 or how \u2013 TikTok will continue to operate in the country.  The latest lawsuit focuses on allegations that TikTok, a trend-setting platform popular among young users, and its China-based parent company ByteDance violated a federal law that requires kid-oriented apps and websites to get parental consent before collecting personal information of children under 13. It also says the companies failed to honor requests from parents who wanted their children\u2019s accounts deleted, and chose not to delete accounts even when the firms knew they belonged to kids under 13.  \u201cThis action is necessary to prevent the defendants, who are repeat offenders and operate on a massive scale, from collecting and using young children\u2019s private information without any parental consent or control,\u201d Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. TikTok said it disagreed with the allegations, \u201cmany of which relate to past events and practices that are factually inaccurate or have been addressed.\u201d \n  \u201cWe offer age-appropriate experiences with stringent safeguards, proactively remove suspected underage users and have voluntarily launched features such as default screentime limits, Family Pairing, and additional privacy protections for minors,\u201d the company said in a statement.  The U.S. decided to file the lawsuit following an investigation by the FTC that looked into whether the companies were complying with a previous settlement involving TikTok\u2019s predecessor, Musical.ly. In 2019, the federal government sued Musical.ly, alleging it violated the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, by failing to notify parents about its collection and use of personal information for kids under 13. That same year, Musical.ly \u2014 acquired by ByteDance in 2017 and merged with TikTok \u2014 agreed to pay $5.7 million to resolve those allegations. The two companies were also subject to a court order requiring them to comply with COPPA, which the government says hasn\u2019t happened.  In the complaint, the Justice Department and the FTC allege TikTok has knowingly allowed children to create accounts and retained their personal information without notifying their parents. This practice extends to accounts created in \u201cKids Mode,\u201d a version of TikTok for children under 13. The feature allows users to view videos but bars them from uploading content. The two agencies allege the information collected included activities on the app and other identifiers used to build user profiles. They also accuse TikTok of sharing the data with other companies \u2013 such as Meta\u2019s Facebook and an analytics company called AppsFlyer \u2013 to persuade \u201cKids Mode\u201d users to be on the platform more, a practice TikTok called \u201cre-targeting less active users.\u201d  The complaint says TikTok also allowed children to create accounts without having to provide their age, or obtain parental approval, by using credentials from third-party services. It classified these as \u201cage unknown\u201d accounts, which the agencies say have grown into millions. After parents discovered some of their children\u2019s accounts and asked for them to be deleted, federal officials said TikTok asked them to go through a convoluted process to deactivate them and frequently did not honor their requests. Overall, the government said TikTok employed deficient policies that were unable to prevent children\u2019s accounts from proliferating on its app and suggested the company was not taking the issue seriously. In at least some periods since 2019, the complaint said TikTok\u2019s human moderators spent an average of five to seven seconds reviewing accounts flagged as potentially belonging to a child. It also said TikTok and ByteDance have technology they can use to identify and remove children\u2019s accounts, but do not use them for that reason.  The alleged violations have resulted in millions of children under 13 using the regular TikTok app, allowing them to interact with adults and access adult content, the complaint said. In March, a person with the matter had told the AP the FTC\u2019s investigation was also looking into whether TikTok violated a portion of federal law that prohibits \u201cunfair and deceptive\u201d business practices by denying that individuals in China had access to U.S. user data.  Those allegations were not included in the complaint, which is asking the court to fine the companies and enter a preliminary injunction to prevent future violations.  Other social media companies have also come under fire for how they\u2019ve handled children\u2019s data. In 2019, Google and YouTube agreed to pay a $170 million fine to settle allegations that the popular video site had illegally collected personal information on children without their parents\u2019 consent.  And last fall, dozens of U.S. states sued Meta Platforms Inc., which owns Facebook and Instagram, for harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. A lawsuit filed by 33 states claims that Meta routinely collects data on children under 13 without their parents\u2019 consent, in violation of COPPA. Nine attorneys general are also filing lawsuits in their respective states, bringing the total number of states taking action to 41 plus Washington, D.C."

        "body": "CHATEAUROUX, France (AP) \u2014 After 10 Olympic Games and 36 years, Nino Salukvadze says she\u2019s finally done.  The pistol shooter from Georgia has been ever-present at the Summer Olympics since Seoul 1988, when she competed for what was still the Soviet Union. At the 2024 Olympics, she became the first female athlete ever to compete at the Games 10 times. In that time, the 55-year-old has seen the Games become bigger, more professionalized and says the competition is tougher than ever.  Salukvadze considered retiring after her first Olympics 36 years ago, after she\u2019d won gold and silver medals as a 19-year-old. She nearly walked away in the 1990s, when she struggled to support her family financially in newly independent Georgia. She announced her retirement after the Tokyo Games in 2021.  This time, though, she says she is done \u201cfor sure.\u201d Coming to the Paris Olympics was about honoring her father Vakhtang, who was also her coach. After the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021, he talked her out of retirement for one last push. \u201cHe was my mentor not only in sports, but also in life. He was a wise man,\u201d she told The Associated Press in the city of Chateauroux, near the Olympic shooting range, on Friday after her last competition.  \u201cHe never asked for anything in his life. We had the kind of relationship where we understood each other just with our eyes,\u201d Salukvadze said. \n \u201c\u2018If you quit sports, you can\u2019t come back. Just try,\u2019\u201d she recalls her father saying. \u201cIt was the only favor he asked me for his whole life. I thought he perhaps wouldn\u2019t be able to ask again. I gathered all my strength, for his sake.\u201d Salukvadze\u2019s father died earlier this year at the age of 93, but lived to see his daughter qualify for a Paris Olympic spot for Georgia.  From her 10 Olympics, Salukvadze has three medals: one gold, one silver and one bronze. At the 2024 Olympics, she placed 38th in the 10-meter air pistol event and 40th in the 25-meter pistol, meaning she didn\u2019t reach a televised final.  Paris Olympics Salukvadze\u2019s last Olympic medal \u2014 and her first for an independent Georgia \u2014 was in Beijing in 2008. At the time, Georgia was at war with neighboring Russia. Salukvadze won bronze and embraced Russian silver medalist Natalia Paderina on the podium in what was widely seen as a gesture for peace. Salukvadze may not be totally done with the Olympics yet. She\u2019s a coach at her own shooting club back home in Georgia, and is a vice-president of the national Olympic committee. Even after 36 years, nothing quite matches the feeling of winning an Olympic gold medal as a teenager back in 1988. \u201cWhen I won at the Olympics and stood on the podium, it was indescribable,\u201d she said. Even now, Salukvadze added, \u201cI can evoke these feelings in myself in the same way, feel it just the same.\u201d AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"

        "body": "HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 The parties in lawsuits seeking damages for last year\u2019s Maui wildfires have reached a $4 billion global settlement, a court filing said Friday, nearly one year after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century.  The term sheet with details of the settlement is not publicly available, but the liaison attorneys filed a motion saying the global settlement seeks to resolve all Maui fire claims for $4.037 billion. The motion asks the judge to order that insurers can\u2019t separately go after the defendants to recoup money paid to policyholders. The settlement was reached amid fears that Hawaiian Electric, the power company that some blame for sparking the blaze, could be on the brink of bankruptcy. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is investigating the Aug. 8, 2023 fires that killed 102 people and destroyed the historic downtown area of Lahaina. Gilbert Keith-Agaran, a Maui attorney who represents victims, including families who lost relatives, said the amount was \u201cwoefully short.\u201d But he said it was a deal plaintiffs needed to consider given Hawaiian Electric\u2019s limited assets and potential bankruptcy.  The agreement was the first step toward getting fire victims compensation, said Jake Lowenthal, a Maui attorney selected as one of four liaisons for the coordination of the cases. More work needs to be done on how to divvy up the amount.  \n \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusions that this is going to make Maui whole,\u201d Lowenthal told The Associated Press. \u201cWe know for a fact that it\u2019s not going to make up for what they lost.\u201d Thomas Leonard, who lost his Front Street condo in the fire and spent hours in the ocean behind a seawall hiding from the flames, welcomed the news. \u201cIt gives us something to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to need that money to rebuild.\u201d  Hawaiian Electric said the settlement will help reestablish the company\u2019s financial stability. Payments would begin after final approval and were expected no earlier than the middle of next year, it said. \u201cFor the many affected parties to work with such commitment and focus to reach resolution in a uniquely complex case is a powerful demonstration of how Hawaii comes together in times of crisis,\u201d CEO Sheelee Kimura said in a statement.  The seven defendants will pay the $4.037 billion to compensate those who already have brought claims, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said. He called the proposed settlement an agreement in principle and said it would \u201chelp our people heal.\u201d \u201cMy priority as governor was to expedite the agreement and to avoid protracted and painful lawsuits so as many resources as possible would go to those affected by the wildfires as quickly as possible,\u201d he said in a statement. He said it was unprecedented to settle lawsuits like this in only one year.  \u201cIt will be good that our people don\u2019t have to wait to rebuild their lives as long as others have in many places that have suffered similar tragedies,\u201d Green said. On Wednesday, Green told the AP in an interview the settlement money would be important for Lahaina\u2019s recovery.  More than 600 lawsuits have been filed over the deaths and destruction caused by the fires, which burned thousands of homes and displaced 12,000 people. In the spring, a judge appointed mediators and ordered all parties to participate in settlement talks. Defendant Maui County said the agreement represents a shared commitment between the parties to continue negotiating in good faith towards a larger, detailed resolution that would seek to equitably distribute the settlement money. The state\u2019s largest landowner, Kamehameha Schools, a charitable trust formerly known as the Bishop Estate, said it\u2019s agreed to contribute a portion of the settlement assuming a final binding agreement is reached.  Two other defendants, Hawaiian Telcom and West Maui Land Co., did not immediately respond to email messages or phone calls seeking comment.  Spectrum/Charter Communications declined to comment. "

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 If you listen to Chrystabell & David Lynch\u2019s new album, there\u2019s a good chance that it will make you dream. Not that \u201cCellophane Memories,\u201d the latest collaboration between the auteur and his \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\u201d co-star will put you to sleep \u2014 although its moody, ethereal sound might help you chill out. The Oscar-nominated surrealist director behind \u201cMulholland Drive\u201d and \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d has long stressed the importance of taking time to let your imagination wander, particularly when it comes to creating art. He and Chrystabell help listeners achieve that state of contemplative wonder with their latest 10-track collaboration. It\u2019s difficult to categorize \u201cCellophane Memories\u201d within a genre, but it consists of austere lyrics and ambient soundscapes carried by Chrystabell\u2019s hypnotic, reverbed vocals.  Although Lynch is known more widely for filmmaking, this is hardly the director\u2019s first foray into music, nor is it his first project with Chrystabell. The pair have collaborated in various capacities for decades, beginning with the song \u201cPolish Poem,\u201d which was featured on Lynch\u2019s 2006 film, \u201cInland Empire.\u201d Produced and written by Lynch and engineered by Chrystabell, the album is Lynch\u2019s first since his longtime creative partner Angelo Badalamenti died in 2022. The late composer contributed to two tracks \u2014 \u201cShe Knew\u201d and \u201cSo Much Love\u201d \u2014 which are both carried by Badalamenti\u2019s synthesizer.  The album is a sonic feast that, like so many of Lynch\u2019s films, challenges modern attention spans. Listening to \u201cCellophane Memories\u201d feels like doing yoga, or perhaps transcendental meditation. The impulse to find additional stimuli in the moment is strong, but the result, if you can stick it out, is a feeling of rejuvenation and boosted creative energy.  \n Much of the album sounds like it could have come straight from \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d; one wonders if its title is a nod to the series\u2019 ultimate dead girl Laura Palmer being found wrapped in plastic. \u201cCellophane Memories\u201d even occasionally employs the familiar, backward dialogue effect used in scenes in the red room to turn Chrystabell\u2019s vocals into a kind of haunting instrument \u2014 like on the brooding \u201cReflections in a Blade.\u201d Hopeful and longing, at times disturbing and even seedy (particularly \u201cThe Answers to the Questions,\u201d thanks to its slowed tempo and foregrounded percussion), the album vacillates between light and darkness \u2014 themes Lynch has throughout his career been keen to explore. His simpatico relationship with Chrystabell, whose creative use and mixing of her own voice elevates \u201cCellophane Memories,\u201d is palpable in this record."

        "body": "A Florida attorney pleaded guilty on Friday to using a rifle to try to detonate explosives outside the Chinese embassy last year in Washington, D.C. Christopher Rodriguez also bombed a sculpture of communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong in a courtyard outside the Texas Public Radio building in San Antonio, Texas, in 2022, according to a court filing accompanying his guilty plea. Rodriguez, 45, of Panama City, Florida, is scheduled to be sentenced in Washington by Chief Judge James Boasberg on Oct. 28. Under the terms of his plea deal, Rodriguez and prosecutors agreed that seven to 10 years in prison would be an appropriate sentence. Rodriguez pleaded guilty to three counts: damaging property occupied by a foreign government, damaging federal property with explosive materials and possessing an unregistered firearm. Rodriguez acknowledged that he drove from Florida to Washington and took a taxi to an area near the Chinese embassy in the early-morning hours of Sept. 25, 2023. Rodriguez placed a black backpack containing about 15 pounds of explosive materials roughly 12 feet from a wall and fence around the embassy grounds. He admitted that he tried to detonate the explosives by shooting at the backpack with a rifle, but he missed his target. A U.S. Secret Service officer found the unattended backpack after Rodriguez left the area. In November 2022, Rodriguez drove to San Antonio in a rental car and scaled an eight-foot fence to enter the courtyard containing the sculpture of Lenin and Mao. He placed two canisters of explosive material on the base of the sculpture, climbed onto a roof overlooking the courtyard and shot the canisters with a rifle, triggering an explosion that damaged the sculpture. Rodriguez, a U.S. Army veteran who was born in Puerto Rico, was arrested in Lafayette, Louisiana, on Nov. 4, 2023. Investigators tied him to the attempted attack on the embassy using DNA from the backpack."

        "body": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 An AP analysis of vote tally sheets released Friday by Venezuela\u2019s main opposition indicates that their candidate won significantly more votes in Sunday\u2019s election than the government has claimed, casting serious doubt on the official declaration that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro won. The AP processed almost 24,000 images of tally sheets, representing the results from 79% of voting machines. Each sheet encoded vote counts in QR codes, which the AP programmatically decoded and analyzed, resulting in tabulations of 10.26 million votes. According to the calculations, the opposition\u2019s Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez received 6.89 million votes, nearly half a million more than the government says Maduro won with. The tabulations also show Maduro received 3.13 million votes from the tally sheets released. By comparison, updated results from the governmental National Electoral Council made public Friday said that based on 96.87% of tally sheets, Maduro had 6.4 million votes and Gonzalez 5.3 million. National Electoral Council President Elvis Amoroso attributed the delay in updating results to \u201cmassive attacks\u201d on the \u201ctechnological infrastructure.\u201d The AP could not independently verify the authenticity of the 24,532 tally sheets provided by the opposition. The AP successfully extracted data from 96% of the provided vote tallies, with the remaining 4% of images too poor to parse.  Gonz\u00e1lez and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said Monday that they had secured the tally sheets from polling centers nationwide and that they showed Maduro lost his bid for a third six-year term by a landslide. Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 The opposition first offered voters the opportunity to look up scanned copies of the tally sheets online. But following criticism and threats from Maduro and his inner circle, the campaign on Friday released its scans. \n The tally sheets, known in Spanish as \u201cactas,\u201d are lengthy printouts that resemble shopping receipts. They have long been considered the ultimate proof of election results in Venezuela. Earlier Friday, a half dozen masked assailants ransacked the opposition\u2019s headquarters in an escalation of violence after several countries called for proof of Maduro\u2019s claim of victory.  Assailants broke down doors and hauled away valuable documents and equipment in the raid around 3 a.m., Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s party said. Several walls were covered in black spray paint. The raid follows threats by top officials, including Maduro, to arrest Machado, who has gone into hiding while still urging Venezuelans and the international community to challenge Sunday\u2019s election results. The Biden administration has thrown its support firmly behind the opposition, recognizing Gonz\u00e1lez as the victor and discrediting the National Electoral Council\u2019s official results. Gonz\u00e1lez was tapped in April as a last-minute stand-in for Machado, who was barred from running for political office. The U.S. announcement late Thursday followed calls from multiple governments, including Maduro\u2019s close regional allies, for Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities to release precinct-level vote counts, as it has during previous elections.  \u201cGiven the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela\u2019s July 28 presidential election,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. Gonz\u00e1lez, whose location is also unknown, posted a message on X thanking the U.S. \u201cfor recognizing the will of the Venezuelan people reflected in our electoral victory and for supporting the process of restoring democratic norms in Venezuela.\u201d Maduro said during a news conference Friday that the U.S. should stay out of Venezuela\u2019s politics.  Maduro also alleged that members of the opposition \u201cplan to carry out an attack\u201d in a Caracas neighborhood near where Machado called on supporters to gather with their families Saturday. He played audio and showed an image of a purported WhatsApp chat that he said was proof of the planned attack. He said he has ordered the armed forces to guard the neighborhood. That order could limit the ability of opposition supporters to gather, but it would not affect the planned demonstration of ruling party supporters elsewhere in the city. There has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts by Brazil, Colombia and Mexico to convince Maduro to allow an impartial audit of the vote. On Thursday, the governments of the three countries issued a joint statement calling on Venezuela\u2019s electoral authorities \u201cto move forward expeditiously and publicly release\u201d detailed voting data. On Friday, Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, said Russian election monitors witnessed Maduro\u2019s legitimate victory and accused the U.S. of stirring tensions in the country. Venezuela sits atop the world\u2019s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America\u2019s most advanced economy, but it entered into a free fall marked by 130,000% hyperinflation and widespread shortages after Maduro took the helm in 2013. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2014, the largest exodu in Latin America\u2019s recent history.  U.S. oil sanctions have only deepened the misery, and the Biden administration \u2014 which had been easing those restrictions \u2014 is now likely to ramp them up again unless Maduro agrees to some sort of transition. \u201cHe\u2019s counting on being able to wait this out and people will get tired of demonstrating,\u201d said Cynthia Arnson, a distinguished fellow at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe problem is, the country is in a death spiral and there\u2019s no chance the economy will be able to recover without the legitimacy that comes from a fair election.\u201d Thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets Monday after the National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner, and the government said it arrested hundreds of protesters.  On Wednesday, Maduro asked Venezuela\u2019s highest court to conduct an audit of the election, but that request drew almost immediate criticism from foreign observers who said the court \u2014 which like most institutions is controlled by the government \u2014 lacks the independence to perform a credible review.  On Friday afternoon, Gonz\u00e1lez was notably absent \u2014 an empty chair beside Maduro \u2014 when the court convened the nine presidential candidates. Supreme Tribunal President Caryslia Rodr\u00edguez called on the candidates and their parties to provide all required documents as the court seeks to audit the results. Maduro took the opportunity to call Gonz\u00e1lez \u201cthe candidate of fascism\u201d and promised to hand over all the voting tallies. Later, Maduro and his campaign manager, National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez, attempted to discredit the tally sheets posted online by the opposition, arguing that they were missing signatures from the electoral council representative as well as poll workers and party representatives. They didn\u2019t acknowledge that soldiers, civilian militia, police and loyalists of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela, on Sunday blocked some opposition representatives from entering the polls, witnessing the vote, and signing and obtaining copies of tally sheets. Goodman reported from Medellin, Colombia, and Kastanis from Los Angeles.

        "body": "Lauren Bell was stressed out and just starting her first job post-college in New York City when she realized a bout of food poisoning wasn\u2019t going away after weeks.  A doctor\u2019s appointment revealed she had irritable bowel syndrome, a surprising diagnosis \u2014 until she learned more about the connection between mental health and gut health, as well as the prevalence of digestive problems among women.  \u201cWorking in a pretty intense environment, living in the city and being an adult for the first time was doing a number on my body,\u201d the 27-year-old said of her diagnosis five years ago. Every few months, a new TikTok about digestive problems goes viral \u2014 the taboo topic often being brought up by women who suggest tips to reduce bloat or ease pain. Experts say it\u2019s not clear whether there is an uptick in the number of people having digestive problems or if the online conversation is leading to more appointments and diagnoses.  But doctors are seeing a pattern of more and younger people wanting to deal with their gastrointestinal distress, and they suspect anxiety related to increased isolation during the pandemic is playing a big role in the increase in visits.  \u201cI definitely have a lot of young women in my practice,\u201d Chicago-based gastroenterologist Dr. Nina Gupta said, \u201cbut in the last few years, I am also seeing more younger men.\u201d Making connections and sharing tips online can help, experts say, but they also want people to be careful because what might look like advice could be more like advertising if influencers are being paid to convince people to buy a product.  \n It\u2019s not clear what causes irritable bowel syndrome. Food sensitivities and gut microbes can play a role, and research indicates that issues with the nervous system can cause distress in the digestive process. Research indicates it can also be a two-way street: When your stomach is upset, that could affect your mental health.  And mental health, especially for Gen Z and younger millennials, is a major concern. While the pandemic took its toll on people of all ages, surveyshave found those age groups reported higher stress and anxiety levels than other generations during and after the pandemic.  A 2023 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that surveyed U.S. high school students during the pandemic showed teen girls\u2019 mental health was severely impacted, with nearly a third reporting that they seriously considered attempting suicide in the previous year. Anxiety in college-age adults, especially young women, has gone \u201cthrough the roof\u201d since the early 2010s, said Jean Twenge, a Gen Z mental health expert at San Diego State University. For high schoolers, experts say the anxiety is likely a result of two things: increased isolation during a formative time and a reliance on social media to feel connected.  While changes in diet can improve IBS symptoms, Gupta said a big part of managing her patients\u2019 conditions is for them to \u201crecognize that there\u2019s a connection between their stress or their mental health or their anxiety and their symptoms.\u201d Nadya Okamoto hadn\u2019t pooped in four days.  \u201cI\u2019m very bloated,\u201d she said as she joined a Zoom interview from her home in New York City.  Okamoto, who has more than 4 million followers on TikTok, has built her platform around publicly addressing sensitive subjects. The 26-year-old is the founder of August, a period-product company, and frequently posts about her own menstrual cycle.  Some of her most popular posts over the last three years, though, are about her experiences with irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. Okamoto seems to share her experiences with everything \u2014 collecting fecal samples for colon cancer, constipation and bloating.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started dating and being in close relationships and talking about it with my family that I realized \u2026 it was not normal pooping three times a month,\u201d Okamoto told The Associated Press.  Seeing the hashtag \u201cIBS\u201d on TikTok led her to the doctor and to a diagnosis. She\u2019s been on three different medications to treat her IBS. None worked. \u201cFrom a young age, potty talk is not something that is appropriate, especially for girls,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not incentivized to be open about it, which means that we know less about our bodies.\u201d  The downside of more people talking about gut health online is an uptick in misinformation. Some of the most popular TikTok posts on IBS are from people who claim they\u2019ve cured it or found a home remedy that miraculously stopped some symptoms. Others recommend unproven supplements. A quick scroll of these influencers\u2019 accounts reveal a litany of sponsorships from probiotic or other health food companies. Gupta said viewers should be skeptical when people who aren\u2019t professionals start offering medical advice.  Okamoto and Bell, who has a master\u2019s of public health in nutrition, stick to talking about their own experiences.  Both stressed that one of the best things about the online conversation is making information more accessible. That said, in December 2023, Bell posted a TikTok video in response to someone asking if they can self-diagnose their IBS with this advice: \u201cI\u2019m always going to recommend you see a medical professional.\u201d Bell, who is Black, fills a specific gap on social media.  \u201cI felt like there weren\u2019t a lot of people who looked like me doing that type of content,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only white women who are hot girls with IBS.\u201d Bell, who takes over-the-counter medications occasionally to treat her symptoms, first started posting on Instagram about her struggle with IBS \u2013 how isolating it was and how she felt like she was having to rearrange her life and diet around her food sensitivities \u2013 and sharing her diagnosis with her friends.  \u201cIt felt kind of like a secret topic that like suddenly everybody in my life had struggled with this, and once you see it, you can\u2019t unsee it,\u201d she said.  Bell sees her role as helping women of color figure out how to start having these uncomfortable conversations about their gut health.  \u201cGut health spans gender, age, race and ethnicity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all poop.\u201d The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

They were bused in for a swimming camp from a social services center in the mostly Muslim, North African-origin neighborhoods that ring Marseille, which is hosting the 2024 Olympicsailing competition at the opposite end of its spectacular, monument-fringed bay. Children attend a swimming camp organized by the Grand Bleu Association which facilitates access to the sea for marginalized children in Marseille, France, Friday, July 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Daniel Cole) FILE - People enjoy a coffee on a balcony in the Old Port of Marseille in southern France, Tuesday, May 7, 2024. (AP Photo/Daniel Cole, File) The millennia-old port is a crossroads of cultures and faiths, where the sea is ever present but not equally accessible, and the beauty and cosmopolitan flair rub shoulders with enclaves of poverty and exclusion even more intimately than in the rest of France. \u201cThere are kids who see the sea from home, but have never come,\u201d said Mathias Sintes, a supervisor at the Corbi\u00e8re marina for the Grand Bleu Association, which has held camps for about 3,000 marginalized children \u2014 50% of whom, he estimates, didn\u2019t know how to swim. \u201cThe first goal is to teach them to save themselves.\u201d A child attends a swimming camp organized by the Grand Bleu Association which facilitates access to the sea for marginalized children in Marseille, France, Friday, July 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Daniel Cole) Brahim Timricht, who grew up in the northern neighborhoods known as the \u201cquartiers nord,\u201c founded the association more than two decades ago to bring children to enjoy the sea that shimmers below their often-dilapidated high-rises on the rocky cliffs. Then he realized that many weren\u2019t learning basic swimming in school \u2014 a requirement for elementary students in France \u2014 and figured he could take advantage of the warm summer months to introduce them to that skill.  \n \u201cThen the mothers told me they still wouldn\u2019t go to the beach, because they didn\u2019t know how to swim and were afraid, so we started programs with them,\u201d Timricht said as dozens of children happily splashed under the hot July sun a few days before the opening of the Olympic sailing competition. Paris Olympics The lack of pools for school programs is a sign of \u201csocial and economic segregation,\u201d said Jean Cugier, who teaches physical education in a high school in the quartiers nord and belongs to the national union of PE teachers. Over the past academic year, he\u2019s been taking 30 sixth-graders 45 minutes by bus to a pool where two lanes were reserved for them \u2014 an unsustainable model, he said, that he\u2019s hoping to modify with pool-based summer camps.

(AP Photo/Daniel Cole) Children attend a swimming camp organized by the Grand Bleu Association which facilitates access to the sea for marginalized children in Marseille, France, Friday, July 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Daniel Cole) While the city has discussed using the Olympic marina after the Games \u2014 as Paris plans to do with an Olympic pool \u2014 the sea is too chilly to swim in during most of the school year. So the only concrete answer to the pool shortage is building more infrastructure, Cugier believes. Another issue complicating swimming education, according to the Ministry of Education, has been the medical certificates that parents bring to excuse children from class. Officials say these are often fake and driven by the desire of some conservative Muslim families not to have boys and girls together at a pool. Pools have become a flashpoint in France\u2019s struggle over its unique approach to \u201cla\u00efcit\u00e9\u201d \u2014 loosely translated as \u201csecularism\u201d and strictly regulating the role of religion in the public space, including schools and even the Olympics. But sports are also a way out of the margins. One of France\u2019s soccer greats, Zinedine Zidane, who carried the Olympic torch in the Paris opening ceremony, was born in the most notorious of Marseille\u2019s quartiers nord. And soccer remains the unifying passion of Marseille\u2019s residents, who routinely flock to cheer home team Olympique de Marseille at the V\u00e9lodrome stadium \u2014 one of the venues for Olympic soccer matches.  For the boys and girls at the Corbi\u00e8re marina, the overall seaside experience has been a chance to meet new people from outside their neighborhood. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to leave,\u201d said one of the group leaders, Sephora Sa\u00efd, on the camp\u2019s last day. She had worn a hijab during the outing, including while paddle-boarding.

(AP Photo/Daniel Cole, File) The sea as an entry and a meeting point is engrained in the very DNA of Marseille. Founded by Greek colonists 2,600 years ago as a trading post, it is France\u2019s oldest city, and its second largest. \u201cBefore it\u2019s a city, Marseille is a port,\u201d said Fabrice Denise, director of the Museum of Marseille History, built next to the Greek archeological site in what is still the city\u2019s center. \u201cIf you want to understand all that\u2019s extraordinary about it, including the realities of cosmopolitanism, you need to understand its multi-century history as a port.\u201d Today\u2019s port, the Mediterranean\u2019s third largest in cargo tonnage, includes everything from refineries to a busy cruise ship area and extends along nearly 40 kilometers (25 miles). But it all started in a small inlet that is today\u2019s top tourist attraction, the Vieux Port. Large boats built of wood and caulked with cotton and fiber carried transforming cargos like grapevines, Denise said. The trade expanded north along the Rhone River in what is now one of France\u2019s most celebrated wine-producing regions.  At the end of the harbor, a small boatyard still restores a handful of boats built in the old way. They were used for fishing until a few decades ago but now are too expensive to maintain for utilitarian purposes.

(AP Photo/Daniel Cole, File) Not far away are the forts that King Louis XIV added in the 17th century to protect the port and the military arsenal he established. The small city became a metropolis. Religious diversity arrived by sea too \u2014 Christians in reality and in myth, one of the most popular ones being that Mary Magdalen herself sailed to Marseille, which is commemorated with a large boat procession each year. Centuries later, and increasingly since decolonization, Muslims from North Africa flocked to Marseille\u2019s shores. Of the city\u2019s 870,000 residents, some 300,000 trace their roots to Algeria alone. In the narrow streets uphill from the Vieux Port, Arabic rings from market stalls, caf\u00e9s and couscous restaurants \u2014 the second-most spoken language in the city. Marseille\u2019s French itself is unique, incorporating not only a distinctive accent but words from the countryside\u2019s Proven\u00e7al language, said M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gasquet-Cyrus, a linguist and professor at the University of Aix-Marseille. He is co-author of the French-language book \u201cMarseille for Dummies.\u201d On its cover, as on the background of most photos including those of the Olympic regattas, stands the hilltop black-and-white-striped 19th century basilica of Notre Dame de la Garde, topped by a nearly 10-meter (33-foot) gold-covered statue of the Virgin Mary looking out to sea. It\u2019s known as \u201cla Bonne M\u00e8re\u201d \u2014 the good mother. \u201cThe Bonne M\u00e8re, it\u2019s almost a pagan symbol,\u201d quipped Gasquet-Cyrus, who says he i an atheist but still goes to visit. \u201cShe\u2019s the protector of the city.\u201d The church welcomes around 2.5 million visitors a year, many for its daily Masses and more on its wide terrace. Its 360-degree views encompass the new and old ports, the villa-studded neighborhoods where the Olympic marina is nestled as well as the blocky towers of the quartiers nord. \u201cYou can see Marseille, and the sea, and the horizon, all under her benevolent gaze,\u201d said the basilica\u2019s rector, the Rev. Olivier Spinosa. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to see beauty from up high, and it invites us to work on beautiful things when we\u2019re down below.\u201d Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres was removed Friday night from an 8-5 loss to Toronto by manager Aaron Boone for not hustling, sending a message to the clubhouse of a team that has struggled since mid-June. Torres did not run hard out of the batter\u2019s box on his 110.7 mph drive off the left-field wall in the second inning, thinking it was a home run, and reached only first base with a single. That cost the Yankees a run when he was thrown out at the plate trying to score on Anthony Volpe\u2019s two-out double into the left-field corner. Boone and Torres had a discussion on the dugout steps before the fourth inning as Torres tried to persuade the manager to keep him in the game. Oswaldo Cabrera took over at second base. \u201cI just felt like I needed to in that spot,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get too down the rabbit hole of making judgments on this one. I just felt like in that moment, I felt like I needed to do that. Simple as that. It is what it is. It\u2019s over with. We\u2019ve got to move on. He had I have spoken and hopefully this is a great learning moment for all of us.\u201d Torres was apologetic when speaking with media after the game. \u201cI think he did the right thing, especially in the moment,\u201d Torres said of Boone. \u201cI feel really sorry for whatever I (did) tonight, especially for the fans and also for my teammates. I\u2019m a human being and I make an error and I feel like for whatever I do tonight, I\u2019m going to learn a lot.\u201d \n  Yankees captain Aaron Judge said Boone\u2019s message was received. \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing your job, you\u2019re going to be out of there,\u201d Judge said. \u201cHe\u2019s made that clear to us and definitely made it clear today. If I know Gleyber, something like this ain\u2019t going to happen again. He takes pride in his work, in his craft and he\u2019s definitely not happy about what happened.\u201d A 27-year-old in his seventh major league season, Torres was an All-Star in 2018 and \u201919 but has struggled since. He is batting .233 with 10 homers and 42 RBIs, raising his average by hitting .250 in July. Boone\u2019s exchange with Torres was captured by a YES Network camera. \u201cMaybe it looked bad, but, it was a conversation, just tried to understand what happened in the moment,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI have to be more mature in that situation and just play hard.\u201d Boone said Torres will be in the lineup Saturday. He said he allowed Torres to play the field in the third inning because he didn\u2019t want to surprise Cabrera with a quick entry to the game. Boone defended his decisions not to pull other players who haven\u2019t hustled. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to make judgments on this guy, that guy. The reality is I have a ton of grace, because a lot of people don\u2019t know the whole story on every situation and what guys are dealing with,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the more overrated things defining a player that plays hard or not, is that part of it. It is a important part of it, but, yeah, we can go back and pull this one, why didn\u2019t you pull on this one? The reality is those guys, including Gleyber, play their asses off.\u201d Judge credited Torres with owning up to his mistake, returning to the dugout to cheer for his teammates with the Yankees trailing and for speaking with reporters to admit he was at fault. \u201cIt speaks volumes of the type of guy he is deep down.\u201d Judge said. \u201cHe could have ran and hid and saw you guys tomorrow, but he was out there front and center.\u201d AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb"

Musnicki and her U.S. teammates finished fifth in the final of the women\u2019s eight on Saturday in what was likely Musnicki\u2019s last Olympic race. Choking back tears, she knew it likely meant the end of a cycle. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly grateful,\u201d Musnicki said. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken, but it\u2019s a privilege to row with these women. It\u2019s been a privilege since my first team in 2010 right up until now. They\u2019re an amazing group of athletes. I consider myself one incredibly lucky woman.\u201d Musnicki, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was the last active link to the U.S. women\u2019s eight dynasty that won every Olympic and world title from 2006 to 2016. She won her Olympic golds with the women\u2019s eight at London in 2012 and in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s a portion of my life that I\u2019ll never forget and that will always be special to me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hurts right now, a lot, but I know that these women and the women from all my other cycles, we will always have this.\u201d The previous oldest American woman rower was Lisa Schlenker, who was 39 when she competed at Athens in 2004. The U.S. finished Saturday\u2019s race nearly seven seconds behind winner Romania. Canada took the silver, Britain got bronze and Australia placed fourth. The U.S. had also missed out on the podium in Tokyo three years ago, finishing fourth. \n \u201cThe nature of sport is you don\u2019t always win and that\u2019s kind of a harsh reality of it,\u201d said Musnicki. \u201cAnd we ended up on the back side of it today. But I\u2019m really proud of what this boat has put together and the campaign that we did. And we stayed together, all nine of us through it all.\u201d The four-time Olympian attributed the U.S. team\u2019s failure to win a medal to the high level of competition in women\u2019s rowing. Paris Olympics \u201cThat\u2019s very exciting and it\u2019s incredible to be a part of that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s not, quite candidly, soul crushing to be on the back side of it. But again, these are all incredible athletes. You\u2019re racing at the Olympics. You are the best of the best of your country. Whether you come in first in the A final or last in the F final, you represent your country and you do them proud.\u201d Her teammate Claire Collins said Musnicki\u2019s \u201cgreat pedigree\u201d and \u201cincredible work ethic\u201d boosted the American team. \u201cI feel very lucky that I\u2019ve been able to overlap with her on this team because she was very much my idol growing up,\u201d the 27-year-old Collins said. \u201cSo it was really special to get to race with her.\u201d Musnicki retired after the Tokyo Games, then got married, moved to California and worked a full-time job at a tech company before deciding to return to rowing to be at the Olympics again. She previously said she wouldn\u2019t continue after the Paris Games, but hasn\u2019t made any of her plans official. Her priorities after Saturday\u2019s race were clear. \u201cI\u2019m going home to be with my cats and my husband,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"

        "body": "MARSEILLE, France (AP) \u2014 Israel earned two sailing medals Saturday when Tom Reuveny won gold and Sharon Kantor took home a silver in a new windsurfing class called iQFOiL on Saturday at the Paris Olympics.  Reuveny, 24, and Kantor, 21, added to a long tradition of windsurfing success for their country. Reuveny was coached by Israel\u2019s first gold medalist, Gal Fridman, also a windsurfing champion. The big day in Marseille comes amid the Israel-Hamas war. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly 20 years since (Fridman won) his gold medal and it\u2019s the first Olympics for him as a coach, and first Olympics for me,\u201d a beaming Reuveny said. \u201cSo many people died in the last year in Israel, and not just in Israel. I\u2019ve lost a few friends. It\u2019s been dark times and I don\u2019t think it could be any better than this, to hear the anthem on the top of the podium.\u201d Marta Maggetti, 28, of Italy won gold in the women\u2019s race, and Britain\u2019s Emma Wilson finished third. Grae Morris earned silver in the men\u2019s race, and Luuc van Opzeeland got bronze. Fridman said the key to Reuveny\u2019s win was his confidence and keeping his cool in changing wind conditions, which have affected the first week of Olympic sailing, even leading to abandoning a windsurfing marathon more than an hour in. \u201cIt\u2019s a mental game,\u201d Fridman said. The 20-year-old Morris celebrated Australia\u2019s first windsurfing medal since 1992 \u2014 and what he called \u201can epic race\u201d \u2014 with cheering fans holding inflatable yellow kangaroos at the beach. The 25-year-old van Opzeeland earned the Netherlands\u2019 second sailing medal in as many days. \n Maggetti had to rally for her victory. Wilson, 25, was left sobbing after entering the day ranked first and leading well into the final race.  \u201cI just made a mistake,\u201d said Wilson, who won a bronze in Tokyo and is the daughter of a two-time windsurfing Olympian. \u201cIt really hurts.\u201d  Paris Olympics Maggetti said the winning move was deciding to take a shorter course by turning before Kantor and Wilson around the upwind mark. \u201cI\u2019ve been calm all day, taking it step by step,\u201d Maggetti said. \u201cI was able to reason it out. I\u2019m super happy.\u201d In iQFOiL windsurfing, the sailors fly off the water pushing speeds well above 20 knots (37 kph or 23 mph), the boards lifted by a foil in regattas that last only about 10 minutes. Olympic sailing regattas in Marseille started on Sunday. They have been plagued by high heat and fickle winds, which forced the first medal races in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s skiffs to be postponed to Friday. The windsurfing quarterfinals, semifinals and medal races were all pushed to Saturday.  Only two athletes were guaranteed a medal at the beginning of the day because of their ranking after days of sailing \u2014 Wilson and Morris. The remaining top nine faced off this way: The athletes ranked four through 10 faced off in a quarterfinal, with the top two advancing to a semifinal against the competitors who began the day in second and third place. The top two finishers in the semi moved on to meet Morris and Wilson. China\u2019s Zheng Yan and Peru\u2019s Mara Bazo advanced in the first quarterfinal to take on Kantor and Maggetti. Kantor and Maggetti then made it to the final. Van Opzeeland and Britain\u2019s Sam Sills advanced to the semifinal to face Reuveny and New Zealand\u2019s Josh Armit, with van Opzelaand and Reuveny going into the men\u2019s final.

The video is a combination of two unrelated clips, neither of which has anything to do with the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The other shows a 2023 concert performed by German band Rammstein. THE FACTS: Amid the Games\u2019 opening ceremony on Friday, social media users falsely claimed that the clips are from the Olympic torch relay. In the first, a small rocket flies out of a church after a clergy member lights its tail on fire. The video transitions to the second clip so that the rocket then appears to hit a large tower, igniting fireworks and large plumes of flames. \u201cLighting of the olympic torch, from a Par\u00eds church,\u201d reads one X post that had received more than 6,700 likes and shares as of Friday. \u201cSpectacular!\u201d The user acknowledged in a follow-up post that the first clip was not filmed in Paris. But neither clip is at all related to the Summer Games. The first shows the Scoppio del Carro, an Easter tradition celebrated in Florence. As part of the complex ritual, the archbishop of Florence lights a dove-shaped rocket called the Colombiana symbolizing the Holy Spirit, according to the city\u2019s tourism website. The rocket then flies out of the city\u2019s cathedral on a wire and sets off fireworks stored in an ornate, centuries-old cart outside the church. Firenze TV, an Italian broadcaster based in Florence, posted the clip on TikTok in 2023. \u201cAlso for this year the flight of the Colombiana was perfect,\u201d reads a caption on the video, written in Italian. \u201cAn extraordinary show, Happy Easter.\u201d \n Distinct architectural details, such as three stained glass windows behind the altar and a large clock above the main door, can be seen in the clip and on the website of the Florence cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. The second clip is from a 2023 concert performed by Rammstein, a German industrial metal band. Rammstein went on a European stadium tour in 2023 and although it is unclear which city the clip shows, the same stunt can be seen in images posted on the group\u2019s official Instagram. A modern tradition, the Olympic torch relay for the Paris Games began in April at the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games in southern Greece, where the first torch was lit. The flame then traveled to France by boat, where it was passed among 11,000 torchbearers on a tour of the country. Finally, it was used to light the Olympic Cauldron in Paris at the end of the opening ceremony.___This is part of the AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared false and misleading information that is circulating online.

Hancock coaches first-time Olympian Prince and turned round to share a hug with his silver medal-winning student after making his last two shots to ensure the gold, making 58 out of 60 shots to Prince\u2019s 57. Hancock won skeet gold at the Olympics in 2008, 2012 and 2021 and is the only skeet shooter to take the Olympic gold more than once. Shooters are eliminated one by one in the finals, and when Taiwan shooter Lee Meng-yuan ended in bronze-medal position, that set up a fight for the gold between Hancock and Prince, who grinned and shook hands. Hancock had two misses close together midway through the competition but rallied to hit every one of his last 26 targets. Prince missed one shot from his final sequence of four to give Hancock the chance to close out the win.

        "body": "A humpback whale that is missing its tail and was spotted in Washington state\u2019s inland waters likely lost its iconic flukes after becoming entangled, possibly in some kind of line or fishing gear, experts say. That loss of the flukes, used for propulsion, would appear to be a death sentence for the creature, last reported as seen in late July. Jessica Farrer, research director with The Whale Museum on Washington\u2019s San Juan Island, was among those who responded to a sighting of the whale July 23 off a nearby island. The institute, as part of its work, helps respond to reports of stranded or distressed marine mammals and educates boaters on best practices for whale watching. Farrer had previously seen injured humpbacks but not something like this. She described the sight of the whale as heartbreaking.  It was seen in the maze of inland waters between Washington state and British Columbia called the Salish Sea. There hasn\u2019t been another reported sighting of the whale since that day, she said. \u201cEverybody has an emotion when they witness a humpback whale dive, and you see those massive flukes that are over 15 feet (4.6 meters) across, and here\u2019s this whale, it\u2019s just lost that. It\u2019s like us losing our legs,\u201d Farrer said.  Experts with whom photos and video of the whale were shared have concluded it likely lost its flukes due to entanglement, she said. But it\u2019s not known exactly what it became entangled in. \n One of the hazards faced by humpbacks is entanglement in fishing gear, such as mooring lines, pots and nets, according to NOAA Fisheries. Other threats are being hit or harassed by ships or boats and the potential impacts of climate change on their food supply. Evidence suggests most humpback whales experience entanglement at some point but often can free themselves, the agency said. The number of whales that die after they become entangled is unclear. There were 16 confirmed humpback entanglements off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California last year, statistics from NOAA Fisheries show. In 2016, the number of confirmed humpback entanglements topped 40, a year when a late Dungeness crab fishing season in California likely meant there was more fishing gear in areas where whales congregate, the agency has said. Justin Viezbicke, a whale entanglement responder and NOAA Fisheries\u2019 stranding coordinator in California, said there are periodic sightings \u2014 maybe every year or two \u2014 of a whale along the West Coast seen without flukes, though he said those situations probably occur more often than they\u2019re seen. Just recently, he said responders off southern California freed a humpback that had become entangled in gear that was digging into its flukes. Earlier this year, responders were able to free a humpback that had become entangled in fishing gear in a high-traffic area near the port of Dutch Harbor, Alaska. NOAA Fisheries described that whale as \u201cessentially hog-tied,\u201d and anchored in place by the line before it was cut free. It is unlikely a humpback would survive long without its flukes, said John Calambokidis, a research biologist with Cascadia Research Collective. He said one of the tragedies of entanglements is not just that animals die but the way in which they die, which can occur slowly and involve suffering. The actual number of entanglements could be much higher than the cases that are confirmed, he said. In recent years there have been increased efforts to find ways to reduce entanglements, he said. California, for example, has made changes in managing its commercial Dungeness crab fisheries to try to protect whales from entanglements.  The humpback populations on the U.S. West Coast also have been increasing and overall are doing well, he said. He contrasted that with the situation on the East Coast involving entanglements of North Atlantic right whales. NOAA Fisheries labels the North Atlantic right whale as one of the world\u2019s most endangered large whale species and entanglements as one of its greatest threats."

        "body": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Police across the U.K. are bracing for more violence Saturday following another night of rioting by far-right protesters that saw four officers hospitalized during a tense stand-off outside a mosque in the city of Sunderland northeast England. During the violent disorder on Friday evening, protesters tossed beer barrels, fire extinguishers and rocks at police officers. A car was set ablaze, and a police station was attacked. Many of those involved were not from the city and traveled to cause chaos, according to police.  The violence in Sunderland, which saw ten people arrested, is the latest outbreak of violence over the past few days and nights, which have ostensibly erupted in the wake of Monday\u2019s stabbing rampage at a dance class in the northwest seaside town of Southport that left three girls dead and several wounded. A 17-year-old male has been arrested. False rumors spread online about the young man\u2019s identity, being a Muslim and an immigrant, fueled anger among far-right supporters. Suspects under 18 are usually not named in the U.K., but Judge Andrew Menary ordered Axel Rudakubana, born in Wales to Rwandan parents, to be identified, in part to stop the spread of misinformation. In a press briefing on Saturday after the clear-up, Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall described the violent protests in Sunderland as \u201cunforgivable\u201d and that four police officers were injured, three as a direct result of the disorder. He also said a mounted rider sustained serious injuries in an accident and is receiving treatment in hospital. \n \u201cDuring the course of the evening, our officers were met with serious and sustained levels of violence,\u201d he said. \u201cMake no mistake, if you were involved last night, expect to be met with the full force of the law.\u201d More than 20 protests are expected over the weekend, including in Belfast, Cardiff, Liverpool and Manchester. Police said many are being organized online by shadowy far-right groups, who are mobilizing support with phrases like \u201cenough is enough,\u201d \u201csave our kids\u201d and \u201cstop the boats.\u201d Counter-protests are also anticipated with the organization Stand Up To Racism rallying against Islamophobia and the far-right. Already, officers in riot gear have been deployed in Belfast city center and police vehicles have formed a barrier between an anti-racism rally and anti-Islamic protesters. A small number of fireworks have been thrown amid tense exchanges. Police have deployed more officers over the weekend in all corners of the UK, made more prison cells available and will deploy surveillance and facial recognition technology. Britain\u2019s new Labour Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said on social media platform X Saturday that criminals attacking the police and stoking disorder will \u201cpay the price\u201d for their thuggery and that the police have the full backing of the government to \u201ctake the strongest possible action.\u201d  Far-right demonstrators have held several violent protests since the stabbing attack, clashing with police Tuesday outside a mosque in Southport \u2014 near the scene of the horrific stabbing \u2014 and hurling beer cans, bottles and flares near the prime minister\u2019s office in London the next day. Many in Southport have expressed their anger at the organized acts of violence in the wake of the tragedy.  The attack Monday on children at a Taylor Swift-themed summer dance class shocked a country where knife crime is a long-standing and vexing problem, though mass stabbings are rare.  Rudakubana, has been charged with murder over the attack that killed Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. He also has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder for the eight children and two adults who were wounded.  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has blamed the violence on \u201cfar-right hatred\u201d and vowed to end the mayhem. He said police across the U.K. would be given more resources to stop \u201ca breakdown in law and order on our streets.\u201d At a news conference Thursday, the prime minister said the street violence was \u201cclearly driven by far-right hatred\u201d as he announced a program enabling police to better share intelligence across agencies and move quickly to make arrests. \u201cThis is coordinated; this is deliberate,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cThis is not a protest that has got out of hand. It is a group of individuals who are absolutely bent on violence.\u201d"

        "body": "MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 The death of Black man who was pinned to the ground by security guards outside a Milwaukee hotel has been ruled a homicide, according to an autopsy released Friday. D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell suffocated while being restrained on June 30 and was suffering from the effects of drugs in his system, according to findings issued by the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s office.  The findings state that Mitchell\u2019s immediate cause of death was \u201crestraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine.\u201d The homicide ruling confirms the medical examiner\u2019s office\u2019s preliminary finding made last month that Mitchell\u2019s death was a homicide The Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s office said previously that it and police investigators were awaiting full autopsy results and that the case was being reviewed as a homicide. The Associated Press sent an email and left a phone message Friday for the district attorney\u2019s office seeking comment on the autopsy report and asking whether its findings would be taken into consideration when decisions on charges are made. The autopsy, signed Wednesday by assistant medical examiner Lauren A. Decker, states that Mitchell\u2019s \u201cinjury\u201d happened while he was \u201crestrained in prone position by multiple individuals after drug (cocaine, methamphetamine) use.\u201d It also states that Mitchell had the \u201csignificant conditions\u201d of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and morbid obesity. A separate demographic report released by the medical examiner\u2019s office states that Mitchell was 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and weighed 301 pounds (137 kilograms). \n The medical examiner\u2019s office also released an investigative report on Friday that said Mitchell \u201cwas restrained by four people after being combative in the hotel lobby.\u201d \u201cHe reportedly went unresponsive while staff awaited police arrival,\u201d the report said. Mitchell died after he was held down on his stomach by security guards outside a Hyatt Regency hotel. Police have said he entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with the guards as they were escorting him out. Relatives of Mitchell and their lawyers had previously reviewed hotel surveillance video provided by the district attorney\u2019s office. They described seeing Mitchell being chased inside the hotel by security guards and then dragged outside where he was beaten. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is part of a team of lawyers representing Mitchell\u2019s family, has said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media shows security guards with their knees on Mitchell\u2019s back and neck. Crump has also questioned why Milwaukee authorities had not filed any charges related to Mitchell\u2019s death. Crump and Mitchell\u2019s family said Friday in a statement that the autopsy findings and homicide ruling \u201cdemand immediate charges against\u201d those involved in Mitchell\u2019s death. \u201cMitchell was in the midst of a mental health crisis and, instead of abiding by their duty to protect and serve, the security officers and other Hyatt staff used excessive force that inflicted injury resulting in death,\u201d the statement says. \u201cWe will not rest until we achieve justice for Mitchell and his grieving family.\u201d Aimbridge Hospitality, the company that manages the hotel, said previously that several employees involved in Mitchell\u2019s death have been fired."

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 YouTube\u2019s biggest star MrBeast is facing complaints about the safety of contestants from the preliminary round of his ambitious \u201cBeast Games\u201d game show, which boasts 1,000 competitors hoping for a $5 million grand prize. Some contestants complained online and to other YouTube influencers that they lacked regular access to food, water and medication during early production at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, and that some competitors were injured during the production.  A spokesperson for MrBeast said his team is reviewing the process and soliciting attendees\u2019 feedback ahead of the next phase of production in Toronto. The stakes for \u201cBeast Games\u201d aren\u2019t just high for the contestants, but for MrBeast himself, whose real name Jimmy Donaldson, as well as the recipients of his brand of \u201cstunt philanthropy\u201d that often entails direct gifts of cash or even houses. The complaints about the \u201cBeast Games\u201d production coincide with Donaldson\u2019s acknowledgement this week that he used racial and homophobic slurs years ago in recordings he made as a teenager. The show, which has already been picked up by Amazon Prime Video to air in 240 countries, is part of Donaldson\u2019s cultural expansion beyond YouTube \u2014 where his channel has 307 million subscribers, including countless young consumers who already purchase his Feastables line of candy or the burgers that bear his name. \u201cMy goal is to make the greatest show possible and prove YouTubers and creators can succeed on other platforms,\u201d Donaldson said in a March press release from Amazon.  \n Donaldson\u2019s companies cast 2,000 people to take part in an initial tryout of sorts at Allegiant Stadium in July, with 1,000 of them presumably advancing to the actual show. Amazon Prime Video was not involved and did not respond to a request for comment. A MrBeast spokesperson said Friday that the promotional video shoot was \u201cunfortunately complicated\u201d by extreme weather, the widespread CrowdStrike outage that wreaked global technological havoc and \u201cother unexpected logistical and communications issues.\u201d  We \u201chave taken steps to ensure that we learn from this experience and we are excited to welcome hundreds of men and women to the world\u2019s largest game show in history,\u201d the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. MrBeast offered eliminated contestants $1,000 upon leaving the competition and the spokesperson said most of those who remain in contention are ready to keep going. Some contestants expected challenges similar to those from the dystopian Netflix show \u201cSquid Game,\u201d a fictional series \u2014 and eventual reality game show \u2014 where deeply indebted people compete for millions in high-stakes children\u2019s games. The Associated Press reached out to several contestants about \u201cBeast Games,\u201d but most either did not respond or declined to speak on the record because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Scott Leopold, a 53-year-old father from Austin, Texas, told the AP he thought he was competing in the actual \u201cBeast Games,\u201d not a precursor to the show. He said he felt deceived about his chances of winning and that the competition in Las Vegas would not stream on Amazon Prime Video. He said that Donaldson should not be \u201cvillainized\u201d but added that \u201can apology would go a long way.\u201d \u201cAll I can conclude is that he was in over his head,\u201d Leopold said. \u201cThere were too many people, and I don\u2019t think he knew how to handle the situation.\u201d Nancy Libby, a Navy veteran from California who said she was one of the last people eliminated, told AP that she applied after seeing a casting call on Facebook. Her daughters watch MrBeast videos, she said, and she\u2019d already planned to take off work anyway. On-set conditions met her expectations. Libby said she was instructed by recruiters beforehand to watch previous MrBeast challenges to gain some understanding of the experience. Because of that, she said, she was unsurprised by meals of oatmeal and nights spent sleeping on the floor. Libby said that \u201ccrowd control\u201d was an issue at times and that more staffing could help ensure competitors do not injure their counterparts. But Libby said the MrBeast team appeared to take safety seriously and that she only witnessed rude behavior from outside contractors. \u201cSometimes when you run things that are first of their kind, things come up that you can\u2019t foresee,\u201d Libby said. \u201cI think that the template was there for a really good competition.\u201d MrBeast has also previously had some contentious relationships with its contractors. One of Donaldson\u2019s companies sued and then was countersued by a vendor they worked with on the \u201cMrBeast Burger\u201d that got widely panned. Fans have also previously complained about not receiving merchandise they ordered from MrBeast or receiving the wrong items or wrong sizes. A vendor working with MrBeast to ship some of those orders acknowledged in an online post last year that they\u2019d let the fan down.

        "body": "SOMA, Gambia (AP) \u2014 When Metta, a mother of six from rural Gambia, heard that lawmakers were considering reversing the country\u2019s ban on female genital cutting, a centuries-old practice she underwent as a child and now fiercely opposes, she was determined that her voice be heard.  She packed her bag and boarded a bus to Gambia\u2019s capital, Banjul, to join scores of women protesting outside the parliament in the largely Muslim nation of less than 3 million people in West Africa. Metta, a survivor of female genital mutilation, poses for a photograph in the village of Sintet, in Gambia, Friday, July. 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag) \u201cI was standing there with a banner,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cOnce we got the news that the ban was kept in place, we danced and cried.\u201d Gambia was for months rocked by a heated debate on female genital mutilation, or FGM, a cultural rite rooted in concepts about sexual purity and control of women. It was the first time the practice \u2014 also known as female circumcision and outlawed in many nations \u2014 was publicly discussed. Reversing it would have been a global first.  Eventually, lawmakers killed the proposal by rejecting all its clauses and preventing a final vote on the bill on July 16. Rights groups declared victory but the debate stirred deep angst among women\u2019s activists. And though the world\u2019s attention was focused on the legislative process, the real battle is still going on \u2014 quietly fought by people like Metta, far from the parliament\u2019s chambers and across rural areas where activists say FGM is still prevalent and remains a highly sensitive topic. A woman takes a rest under a tree at a village of Sintet, in Gambia, Friday, July. 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag) \n Women in Gambia\u2019s rural hinterland \u2014 even those like Metta who cheered in front of the parliament \u2014 are reluctant to talk about cutting, fearing a backlash. Some who spoke out against the practice said they received hate messages. When speaking to the AP, women would not give their full names for fear of reprisals. Local activists are walking a thin line. After agreeing to give the AP full access to an awareness village meeting, they took it back, saying that the foreign journalists\u2019 presence could jeopardize their efforts. The challenges are staggering. The United Nations estimates that about 75% of women in Gambia have been subjected as young girls to FGM, which includes partial or full removal of a girl\u2019s external genitalia. The World Health Organization says it\u2019s a form of torture. The procedure, typically performed by older women or traditional community practitioners, is often done with tools such as razor blades and can cause serious bleeding, death and complications later in life, including in childbirth.  More than 200 million women and girls across the world are survivors of FGM, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to U.N. estimates. In the past eight years alone, some 30 million women globally have been cut, most of them in Africa but also in Asia and the Middle East, UNICEF said in March. Children walk on the streets in Sintet, Gambia, Friday, July. 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag) In 2015, Gambia\u2019s former leader Yahya Jammeh \u2014 now in exile and accused of human rights violations \u2014 unexpectedly banned cutting, giving no explanations.  However, the practice continued. The first prosecutions occurred only last year, when three women were convicted for taking their daughters to be cut, sparking a backlash to the ban and setting off the debate.  Gambian authorities did not respond to a request for comment about the issue. Women pose for a photograph after a meeting on female genital mutilation, in Soma, Gambia, Thursday, July. 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag) Supporters of the ban argued that cutting is rooted in Gambia\u2019s culture and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Religious conservatives behind the campaign to reverse the ban described cutting as \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d Those against FGM said its supporters are seeking to curtail women\u2019s rights in the name of tradition. Habibou Tamba, a 37-year-old local activist who attended the rally outside the parliament, said a prominent community member \u2014 whom he did not identify \u2014 sent him a message afterward, accusing him of serving the interests of the West. \u201cWe will never be subjected to the Western ideology,\u201d said the message, seen by the AP. It added: \u201cThis is the beginning of the war.\u201d  Women attend a meeting on female genital mutilation in Soma, Gambia, Thursday, July. 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag) But Tamba says that for him, protests were about the right of women to live free from pain, not about Western values. At the awareness meeting, held at a local government office, activists talked to a few dozen women from neighboring villages about the perils of child marriage and FGM. On the wall, they projected images of deformed female genitalia to explain possible health complications from cutting.  With each picture, women in the room gasped with shock and disgust. But not all were convinced.  \u201cI went through FGM but nothing happened to me,\u201d said one woman. \u201cI have more than five children and I never had any complications.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s our culture and it\u2019s also a part of the teaching of the prophet,\u201d she said, and added that after the ban was introduced, she took her daughter far from their village to be cut in secrecy.  Another woman said the ban was \u201cviolating our rights as Muslim women.\u201d Not a single woman at the meeting spoke up in defense of the ban. Rabietou, a 42-year-old mother of six, was outside nursing her youngest daughter, 7-month-old Fatima.  \u201cI came here because of her,\u201d she said, cradling her baby. Rabietou\u2019s eldest daughter, Aminata, 26, also came. The two had rallied women from their village to come to the meeting. Rabietou recounted how she was cut by a relative when she was a girl, and forced to leave school and get married at the age of 15.  A year later, she gave birth \u2014 in excruciating pain \u2014 to Aminata, who was also cut and left school early to marry.  \u201cNo one told me about the health consequences,\u201d Rabietou said.  As she grew more aware of the risks through conversations with activists and other women, she became determined to break the cycle. She said she won\u2019t have Fatima cut, and has also advised Aminata not to cut her daughter. Metta said she was cut when she was 8.  \u201cNo one said anything to me, just that it\u2019s tradition,\u201d she said. She never discussed what happened with anyone. When activists started organizing meetings in her community, it was hard for her to believe what they were saying. But she came to the conclusion it\u2019s time to start talking.  Women from her village started to share their experiences and soon discovered they all faced similar struggles: Pain when they were cut. A lot of pain when they were intimate with their husbands. Even more pain when they were giving birth.

(AP Photo/Annika Hammerschlag) In the end, after discussing it with their husbands, most decided to stop the cutting. None of Metta\u2019s four daughters have been cut. \u201cBefore, people used to say: If you don\u2019t cut your daughter, she will not listen. She will not have discipline,\u201d Metta said. \u201cBut going to the bush and teaching your children discipline are two very different things.\u201d \u201cI will not let my daughters go through the same pain as I did,\u201d she said.

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Antitrust tensions are heating up in the chipmaking industry. Rivals have accused Wall Street darling Nvidia of abusing its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence \u2014 and the U.S. Justice Department is now investigating these complaints, technology news site The Information reported. According to the news outlet, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the discussions, Justice Department officials are looking into concerns Nvidia is potentially cornering the market and pressuring its customers to unfairly retain business. That includes allegations of Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant and its competitors. The Information also reported that U.S. officials had reached out to several Nvidia competitors about the complaints. The Justice Department declined to comment or provide further information when reached by The Associated Press on Friday.  But a statement from Nvidia said the company \u201cwins on merit\u201d \u2014 and competes \u201cbased on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws.\u201d Without directly acknowledging details of The Information\u2019s Thursday report, the company added that it is \u201chappy to provide any information regulators need.\u201d Nvidia has faced calls for an antitrust investigation from some Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups before. Earlier this week, 10 progressive advocacy groups \u2014 including Demand Progress Education Fund and Tech Oversight Project \u2014 penned a letter to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in support of an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker. \n \u201cNvidia is the world\u2019s chip gatekeeper,\u201d the groups wrote, arguing the company had \u201cbullied its way into a prominent investment position\u201d by leveraging scarce supply alongside tactics like blocking customers from doing business with competitors. \u201cSuch a company deserves the most aggressive scrutiny that the Department of Justice can bring to bear.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s has cemented itself as a poster child for the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 and in the process become one of the most valuable companies in the world. In June, the tech giant briefly reached a market value of more than $3.3 trillion. Some of that market momentum has stalled a little since \u2014 and any stock climbing to such heights is vulnerable to some investors selling shares to lock in profits. On Friday afternoon, shares for Nvidia were down 3%."

        "body": "WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) \u2014 Attorneys for Elon Musk and Tesla\u2019s corporate directors are asking a Delaware judge to vacate her ruling requiring the company to rescind a massive and unprecedented pay package for Musk. Friday\u2019s hearing follows a January ruling in which Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick concluded that Musk engineered the landmark 2018 pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent. The compensation package initially carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla\u2019s stock price. Following the court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time, again by an overwhelming margin. Defense attorneys say the vote makes clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick pointed out in her January ruling, are adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. \u201cHonoring the shoulder vote would affirm the strength of our corporate system,\u201d David Ross, an attorney for Musk and the other individual defendants, told McCormick. \u201cThis was stockholder democracy working.\u201d Ross told the judge that the defendants were not challenging the factual findings or legal conclusions in her ruling, but simply asking that she vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package. \n McCormick, however, seemed skeptical of the defense arguments, peppering attorneys with questions and noting that there is no precedent in Delaware law for allowing a post-trial shareholder vote to ratify adjudicated breaches of fiduciary duty by corporate directors. \u201cThis has never been done before,\u201d she said. Defense attorneys argued that, while they could find no case that is exactly comparable, Delaware law has long recognized shareholder ratification as a cure to corporate governance errors, and has long acknowledged the \u201csovereignty\u201d of shareholders as the ultimate owners of a corporation. \u201cI candidly don\u2019t see how Delaware law can tell the owners of the company that they\u2019re not entitled to make the decision they made,\u201d said Rudolf Koch, an attorney for Tesla. Donald Verrilli, a lawyer for an induvial stockholder who owns more than 19,000 Tesla shares, suggested that it would be wrong for the lone shareholder who filed the lawsuit to thwart the will of the majority of Tesla shareholders. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff owned just nine shares of Tesla stock. \u201cThe voice of the majority of shareholders should matter\u2026. This lawsuit is not representing the interest of the shareholders,\u201d Verrilli said. Thomas Grady, an attorney for a group of Florida objectors who own or manage almost 8 million Tesla shares with some $2 billion, argued that for McCormick to rule for the plaintiff, she has to \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d all other Tesla shareholders. Greg Varallo, an attorney for the plaintiff, urged McCormick not to give any credence to the June shareholder vote, saying it has no legal precedent in Delaware or anywhere else. There also is no reason for the court to reopen the trial record and admit new evidence, he said. Under Delaware law, stockholders have no authority to overrule courts by trying to use a post-trial ratification vote as a \u201cgiant eraser,\u201d Varallo argued. \u201cRatification is not magic, and it never has been,\u201d Varallo added. \u201cThis should end here and now.\u201d McCormick gave no indication on when she would rule. She also has yet to rule on a huge and unprecedented fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who contend that they are entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $7 billion."

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats have unified with remarkable speed behind Vice President Kamala Harris as she has taken over the top of the party\u2019s ticket heading into the November presidential election.  It may be another story when it comes to a running mate. As Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly have emerged as among the potential finalists, both have face criticism from some organizations and activists who might otherwise be supportive of Democratic causes. Harris\u2019 team says she is interviewing six possible choices over the weekend before an announcement expected Monday. The next day, she and her running mate will appear together at a rally in Philadelphia, then visit six more swing states.  In addition to Shapiro and Kelly, Harris is said to be considering Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg Some congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse attacks by the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, who argues that Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies are too relaxed. Shapiro has high-profile supporters, too, including Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate \u2014 appearing to suggest that the mayor had inside knowledge about Harris\u2019 decision. \n But a person with knowledge of the mayor\u2019s thinking said the video was simply a case of Parker showing support for both Harris and the potential that Shapiro, Parker\u2019s friend, would be the vice presidential pick. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Both Kelly and Shapiro have also seen their detractors become more vocal as Harris\u2019 closes in on a decision.  While that may not ultimately sway Harris, it is an indication that the honeymoon period for the vice president, where the distinct wings of the Democratic Party coalesced behind her, may be ending in the less than two weeks since President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed her.  Some labor groups have criticized Kelly for opposing proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly as a potential running mate.  What to know about the 2024 Election Fain also said the union does not favor Shapiro, who has previously proved willing to join with Republicans in calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools. Fain did single out Beshear, Walz and Pritzker for praise. \u201cShe\u2019s probably got a thousand people telling her the same thing, you know, of what they think,\u201d Fain said in an interview. \u201cAnd so she\u2019s got to make the decision based off of what she feels is, you know, is best for her.\u201d  The nonprofit Institute for Middle East Understanding said in a statement that Shapiro \u201cis not the right candidate for the job, and selecting him would be a step in the wrong direction.\u201d Shapiro, who says he plans to be at Harris\u2019 rally Tuesday in Philadelphia, has aggressively confronted what he views as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas as it Israel battles the militants in Gaza. Shapiro called out universities for not acting quickly to tackle antisemitism and he became a prominent critic of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s president, Liz Magill. She resigned after testifying at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school\u2019s conduct policy. Shapiro has also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while suggesting that any end to the Israel-Hamas war requires the removal of Hamas from power.  The governor has been criticized by the Council on American-Islamic Relations for not condemning Israel for the killing of civilians in Gaza or for not calling for Israel to stop the fighting in the territory. Shapiro has countered that he has met with Muslim Americans and understands their pain. The progressive activist organization RootsAction.org opposes Shapiro\u2019s views on Israel, school vouchers and the environment, among other issues. It says that in considering Shapiro, Harris \u201chas set off alarm bells among young people, racial justice organizers, Arab Americans, Muslims and others whose votes and campaign activism were crucial to defeating Trump four years ago.\u201d Meanwhile, The Philadelphia Inquirer resurfaced an opinion article Shapiro wrote in 1993 as a 20-year-old college student at the University of Rochester where he said peace \u201cwill never come\u201d to the Middle East and that Palestinians were \u201ctoo battle-minded\u201d to coexist with Israel.  Asked about it, Shapiro responded, \u201cI was 20\u201d adding that he long has supported a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  \u201cIt is my hope that we can see a day where peace will reign in the Middle East,\u201d he said. Also opposing Shapiro are some environmental leaders and residents of the rural town of Dimock, Pennsylvania. They have drafted a letter to Harris urging her not to choose Shapiro and charging that the governor failed to keep his promises to clean up area groundwater contaminated by natural gas production via hydraulic fracturing.

With their silver medal behind the Simone Biles-led U.S. team\u2019s gold, Angela Andreoli, Alice D\u2019Amato, Manila Esposito, Elisa Iorio and Villa matched Italy\u2019s best result in Olympic gymnastics, a feat the country achieved in 1928.

        "body": "MARSEILLE, France (AP) \u2014 Little model boats hang from the ceiling and maritime paintings adorn the walls of the basilica of Notre Dame de la Garde, which from the city\u2019s highest hill overlooks the bay of Marseille, where sailing regattas are being held for the 2024 Olympics. They\u2019re votive offerings \u2014 some more than 200 years old \u2014 that residents of this Mediterranean port city continue to bring in gratitude to the Virgin Mary for everything from avoiding shipwrecks to successful rescues of migrants trying to make it to Europe on unseaworthy boats. \u201cSince its origins, Notre Dame de la Garde has been venerated by all seafarers,\u201d said Jean-Michel Sanchez, the head conservator of the basilica\u2019s museum. \u201cMarseille was born of the sea.\u201d He estimates the basilica\u2019s collection of ex-votos, as the offerings are called, at several thousands, including many in storage. And that\u2019s after those predating the French Revolution were destroyed in the anticlerical violence that followed it. Offerings shaped in reference to prayers answered \u2013 from babies to limbs, from vehicles to sports jerseys \u2013 are common across Catholic and Orthodox churches in Southern Europe especially, and in parts of the United States. The nautical motifs that dominate Marseille\u2019s landmark church are inextricably linked to the city\u2019s 2,600-year-old seafaring history. The first chapel was built in the 1200s on a barren rocky outcrop above the main port. In the 16th century, France\u2019s king ordered the construction of a fort around the chapel to defend the growing harbor. Most of it still serves as the pedestal on which the massive basilica that replaced the chapel was built in the 1850s. \n The name itself speaks to that connection between guarding the port and divine protection, Sanchez said. \u201cGarde\u201d means guard in French. Inside the church, the models hanging from the ceiling include elegant sailboats, three-masted ships and utilitarian cargo vessels. About once a month someone brings a new one \u2014 sometimes with an explanation, sometimes anonymously, most handmade. Among the most recent additions is a helicopter, donated a few years ago by civil defense forces. They were grateful for never having had an accident while conducting high-risk rescues of climbers in Marseille\u2019s calanques, narrow inlets east of the Olympic marina, said Marie Aubert, who works with the basilica\u2019s historical collections. Hundreds of marble plaques, some just inscribed \u201cmerci a N D\u201d \u2014 thank you to Our Lady \u2014 pack the walls. So many continue to be donated that church officials are now lining the terrace walls outside with them. \u201cThe connection of the people of Marseille with the Bonne M\u00e8re is transmitted from generation to generation,\u201d said the basilica\u2019s rector, the Rev. Olivier Spinosa, using the popular name for the church, French for \u201cgood mother.\u201d One chapel is decorated with paintings of boats, including a 2011 work donated by a ship\u2019s two captains. It gives thanks for their crews\u2019 rescue of nearly two dozen North African migrants in the Mediterranean, Spinosa said. The painting is inscribed with a prayer for all victims of trafficking and illegal immigration \u2014 one of Europe\u2019s political flashpoints and a recurring source of tragedy, with estimates of nearly 30,000 migrants dying trying to cross the sea in the past decade. Both were themes of Pope Francis\u2019 visit to Marseille last fall and the prayer service he celebrated by the basilica.  In its apse, behind a statue of Mary that arrived, of course, by boat, is a 19th-century mosaic of a ship sailing between choppy and calm seas by a lighthouse. It\u2019s an allegory of the church traversing the storms of history, with Mary providing the guiding light. \u201cThe Bonne M\u00e8re is a mother who welcomes everyone,\u201d Spinosa said. \u201cLike the soul of Marseille.\u201d Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "body": "ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) \u2014 As the sun blazes down in Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja, Ahmed Bukar turns on his home air conditioner to a blast of hot air. The charging valve on the outside unit is leaking out the cooling gas that the appliance runs on. A technician had recently helped him refill the air conditioner with gas, but he didn\u2019t test for possible leaks. In Abuja and across Nigeria, air conditioners sprout from the walls as the appliance turns from a middle-class luxury into a necessity in an increasingly hot climate. The industry is governed by regulations prohibiting the release of cooling gases into the air, for example by conducting leak tests after an appliance is fixed. Still, routine release of gases into the atmosphere due to shoddy installations, unsafe disposal at the end of use, or the addition of gas without testing for leaks is a common problem in Nigeria, though unlawful.  The gases known as refrigerants that make cooling systems work are hundreds to thousands of times the warming potency of carbon dioxide and the worst of them also harm the ozone layer. Following global agreements that promised to limit these gases being spewed into the air, like the Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendments, Nigeria has enacted regulations guiding the use of these gases. But enforcement is a problem, threatening Nigeria\u2019s commitments to slash emissions. \u201cThose laws, those rules, nobody enforces them,\u201d said Abiodun Ajeigbe, a manager for the air conditioning business at Samsung in West Africa. \u201cI have not seen any enforcement.\u201d  A technician works on an indoor air conditioning unit in Lagos, Nigeria, Thursday, July 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba) \n The weak regulatory system for the cooling industry in Nigeria is evident in the rampant lack of proper training and awareness of environmental harm caused by refrigerants among technicians, according to Ajeigbe. And it is common to see.  After uninstalling an air conditioner for a client who was moving to another neighborhood, Cyprian Braimoh, a technician in Abuja\u2019s Karu district, casually frittered the gas from the unit into the air, preparing it to be refilled with fresh gas at the client\u2019s new location.  If he followed the country\u2019s regulations, he would collect the gas into a canister, preventing or minimizing the gas\u2019s environmental harm. Technicians like Braimoh and those who serviced Bukar\u2019s appliance without testing for leaks are self-employed and unsupervised. But they often get customers because they offer cheaper services. \u201cI was not taught that; I only release it into the air,\u201d said Braimoh, who originally specialized in electrical wiring of buildings before fixing air conditioners to increase his income options. He received patchy training that did not include the required safety standards for handling refrigerants. And he still did not conduct a leakproof test after installing the air conditioning at his client\u2019s new location, which is required by the country\u2019s cooling industry regulations. Installations done by well-trained technicians who follow environmental regulations can be costlier for customers. It\u2019s often the case in Nigeria, where hiring the services of companies like Daibau, who later helped Bukar fix his leaks, could result in higher costs. Manufacturers who offer direct refrigeration and air conditioning installation services to big commercial customers have tried to self-regulate with safety training and certifications for their technicians, Ajeigbe said.  People sell air conditioners on the street in Lagos, Nigeria, Monday, July 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba) According to industry professionals and public records, the most common air conditioners in Africa still use what\u2019s known as R-22 gas. This refrigerant is less harmful to the ozone layer compared to the older, even more damaging coolants called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs have been largely eliminated, thanks to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which was created to protect the ozone layer, the vital shield in the atmosphere that protects against cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. But R-22 is 1,810 times more damaging to the climate than carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Just one pound of the coolant is nearly as potent as a ton of carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, but while CO2 can stay in the atmosphere for over 200 years, R-22 stays in the atmosphere for around 12 years. R-22 air conditioners also have low energy efficiency and most of the electricity powering them in Africa is from fossil fuels. Nigeria plans to phase out the R-22 refrigerant by January 1, 2030. But with lax enforcement, meeting the phaseout target is in doubt, Ajeigbe said.  Newer air conditioners that use a family of gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) don\u2019t harm the ozone and consume less electricity. But HFCs are still potent greenhouse gases, and account for around 2% of all human-caused warming in the atmosphere. One HFC, R-410A, which is still a common refrigerant in Europe and the United States, has a warming potential 2,088 times greater than that of carbon dioxide and lasts roughly 30 years in the atmosphere. Air conditioners running on it are the next most common in Africa.  Another HFC, R-32, is 675 times more potent than CO2, lasts about five years in the atmosphere, and is more energy-efficient. But it is just \u201cmarginally\u201d in the African market, Ajeigbe said. Air conditioners running on HFCs are more expensive, meaning they\u2019re less popular than the more polluting ones, according to sellers and technicians in Abuja and Lagos.

In Ghana, the cooling industry also struggles to get technicians to comply with environmental standards. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \u201cpoor servicing practices prevalent\u201d in the country are largely driven by consumers, who choose low-trained technicians on price considerations and neglect recommended standards.  In Kenya, the demand for cooling systems is growing as temperatures warm, the population grows and electricity access expands. Air conditioners running on R-22 are still very common in Kenya, but the National Environmental Management Authority told The Associated Press there have not been new imports since 2021, in line with 2020 regulations. The regulations require technicians handling refrigerants and cooling appliances to obtain a license, but that is not enforced, technicians told AP, leaving space for environmentally unsafe practices.  \u201cYou just need to be well trained and start installations, it\u2019s a very simple industry for us who are making a living in it,\u201d said Nairobi-based technician Jeremiah Musyoka. One cooling gas that\u2019s energy efficient and less harmful to the atmosphere, R-290, is slowly gaining traction as an alternative for refrigeration and air conditioning in developed markets like the EU. The demand for efficient heat pumps is rapidly expanding in the EU, but adoption in Africa remains insignificant due to cost barriers and limited awareness.  Countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya have also identified R-290 to ultimately replace HFCs, but models using it are not commercially available. And they still have to worry about specialized training for technicians because of R-290\u2019s high flammability.  \u201cIt worries me there is not enough training and existing regulations are not enforced,\u201d Ajeigbe, manager at Samsung, said. But he said enforcing the import ban on banned gases and the appliances that use them would make a difference.  Anastasia Akhigbe, a senior regulatory official at Nigeria\u2019s National Environmental Standards and Regulations Agency, added that increasing awareness among appliance importers, technicians, and consumers about the environmental impacts of certain refrigerants would also help. \u201cEnforcement is a known challenge, but we are moving gradually,\u201d Akhigbe said. \u2014 AP reporter Evelyne Musambi in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this report.

        "body": "VILLEPINTE, France (AP) \u2014 Algerian boxer Imane Khelif takes to the ring at the Paris Olympics again Saturday following days of sharp scrutiny and online abuse as misconceptions about her gender have exploded into a larger clash about identity in sports. Khelif meets Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary, whose boxing association planned to contest the matchup with the International Olympic Committee but still let the fight go ahead, in a quarterfinal in the women\u2019s 66-kilogram quarterfinals.  Live updates: Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 Olympics in Paris as Simone Biles, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and Karie Ledecky compete for gold medals. If Khelif wins, the veteran amateur will secure the seventh Olympic boxing medal in Algeria\u2019s history, its first since 2000 and the nation\u2019s first ever in women\u2019s boxing. Ahead of the bout, Algerians waved flags in the crowd and chanted Khelif\u2019s name, even when other boxers were fighting. She won her opening bout Thursday when opponent Angela Carini of Italy tearfully abandoned the fight after just 46 seconds. The unusual ending became a sharp wedge to drive into an already prominent divide over gender identity and regulations in sports, drawing comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \u201cHarry Potter\u201d writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender. At a Paris Games that has championed inclusion and seen other outcry over an opening ceremony performance featuring drag queens, LGBTQ+ groups say the hateful comments could pose dangers to their community and female athletes. IOC President Thomas Bach on Saturday defended Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan. Khelif and Lin were disqualified in the middle of last year\u2019s world championships by the International Boxing Association, the now-banned former governing body of Olympic boxing, after what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women\u2019s competition. \n Both had competed in IBA events for several years without problems, and the Russian-dominated body \u2014 which has faced years of clashes with the IOC over judging scandals, leadership decisions and financial issues \u2014 has refused to provide any information about the tests, underscoring its lack of transparency in nearly every aspect of its dealings, particularly in recent years. Paris Olympics \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear here: We are talking about women\u2019s boxing,\u201d Bach said Saturday. \u201cWe have two boxers who are born as a woman, who have been raised a woman, who have a passport as a woman, and who have competed for many years as women. And this is the clear definition of a woman. There was never any doubt about them being a woman.\u201d The IBA, which received the unprecedented punishment of being banned from Olympic participation in 2019 following years of conflict with the IOC, disqualified Khelif last year for what it said were elevated levels of testosterone.  The IBA, which is led by an acquaintance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has not released more details on the tests, calling the process confidential. \u201cWhat we see now is that some want to own the definition of who is a woman,\u201d Bach added. \u201cAnd there I can only invite them to come up with a scientific-based new definition of who is a woman, and how can somebody being born, raised, competed and having a passport as a woman cannot be considered a woman?  \u201cIf they are coming up with something, we are ready to listen,\u201d Bach added. \u201cWe are ready to look into it, but we will not take part in a sometimes politically motivated cultural war.\u201d Khelif is fighting for a chance to clinch at least a bronze medal in her second Olympics after failing to medal at the Tokyo Games held in 2021. Lin, also a two-time Olympian, will clinch her first medal Sunday if she beats Svetlana Staneva of Bulgaria. Lin won her opening bout Friday comfortably over Uzbekistan\u2019s Sitora Turdibekova.  Amid the scrutiny, both Khelif and Lin have received only cheers from the crowds at North Paris Arena. \u201cWhat is going on in this context in the social media, with all this hate speech, with all this aggression and abuse, and fueled by this agenda, is totally unacceptable,\u201d Bach said. The reduced field at the Paris Olympics boxing tournament \u2014 which has the fewest number of total boxers since 1956 \u2014 means that many fighters can clinch medals with just two victories. Boxing awards two bronze medals in each weight class, which means every semifinalist wins a medal. The Olympic sport reached gender parity for the first time in Paris, inviting 124 men and 124 women just 12 years after women\u2019s boxing made its Olympic debut.

        "body": "After 13 years of marriage, Bethany Meola acknowledges she and her husband can get mired in the midlife chaos that comes with navigating careers and raising three children. That\u2019s why the six-second kiss felt so good. A daily intimacy exercise pioneered by couples therapists and clinical psychologists John and Julie Gottman, the six-second kiss is what it sounds like \u2014 taking a few moments out of each day to connect physically with your partner. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a funny thing to put on the to-do list,\u201d said Meola, who first learned of the Gottmans\u2019 work while studying for a theology master\u2019s degree focused on marriage and family. Even when it felt a little silly, it made a difference. \u201cIt\u2019s long enough to kind of ground you and say, \u2018Here\u2019s this other person that I love that I\u2019ve committed to,\u2019 and you\u2019re resting in their presence in kind of a renewed way,\u201d said Meola, co-founder of the nonprofit Life-Giving Wounds in Bowie, Maryland, which aims to help adult children of divorced or separated couples. Six seconds is not an arbitrary number, John Gottman said during a joint video interview with his wife and collaborator. The couple married in 1987 and co-founded the Gottman Institute, which trains couples therapists. After studying more than 3,000 couples over 30 years, the Gottmans found that six seconds of intentional intimacy is enough to trigger the release of oxytocin. It\u2019s the same hormone that\u2019s widely believed to be responsible for bonding a baby with its mother; the Gottmans say it builds trust in a relationship by calming down the fear center of the brain. This article is part of AP\u2019s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. Gottman cited research by neuroeconomist Paul Zak that suggests a 20-second hug does the same.  \n \u201cIt comes whenever mammals cuddle with one another,\u201d said Gottman, author of \u201cThe Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work\u201d and other books. \u201cFor the 20-second hug or the six-second kiss, it\u2019s one that really feels different. It feels like you\u2019ve come home.\u201d Julie Gottman said an elongated kiss works best for couples who are committed to each other and have built a level of trust. Couples who are in distress and working through issues in therapy might not be ready for it. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to give that information to a very distressed couple early on before significant changes,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it won\u2019t feel authentic if there\u2019s still a lot of distrust.\u201d Couples have to decide to take time out of their day to prioritize their relationship. One partner might open the discussion by saying they believe the exercise could deepen their bonding, and why not try it out? Then it\u2019s best to create a ritual. Set aside the same moment every day, for instance when everyone is about to leave for work and school or just before bedtime. Creating a ritual of connection during these transitional moments guards against \u201cthe managerial relationship, where the only thing a couple does together is adding to their very long list of tasks,\u201d John Gottman said. \u201cWe want to really nurture the romance.\u201d Rituals also foster a shared sense of purpose, Julie Gottman said. Just be sure to savor it, rather than making it a thing you\u2019re supposed to do. And to the couples who say they can\u2019t find the time? She didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have six seconds?\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not talking six hours here. We\u2019re talking six seconds. So, tell me more about what that block is about. Is there something else going on?\u201d EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Albert Stumm writes about food, travel and wellness.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A surprising rise in the U.S. unemployment rate last month has rattled financial markets and set off new worries about the threat of a recession \u2014 but it could also prove to be a false alarm.  Friday\u2019s jobs report, which also showed hiring slowed last month, coincides with other signs the economy is cooling amid high prices and elevated interest rates. A survey of manufacturing firms showed activity weakened noticeably in July. Hurricane Beryl, however, hit Texas during the same week the government compiles its job data and could have held back job gains.  The U.S. economy used to flash reliable signals when it was in or near a recession. But those red lights have gone haywire since the COVID-19 pandemic struck and upended normal business activity. Over the past two or three years, they\u2019ve signaled downturns that never arrived as the economy just kept rolling along. Worries about a recession are also quickly politicized, even more so as the presidential election intensifies. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign on Friday said the jobs report is \u201cmore evidence that the Biden-Harris economy is failing Americans.\u201d For his part, President Joe Biden said that since he and Vice President Kamala Harris took office, the economy has added nearly 16 million jobs, while the unemployment rate fell to half-century lows. Some of those job gains reflect a bounce-back from the pandemic, but the U.S. now has 6.4 million more jobs than it did before COVID-19.  \n Even so, Friday\u2019s report from the U.S. Labor Department is raising recession fears again. The Dow Jones average tumbled more than 600 points, or 1.5%, Friday and the broader S&P 500 fell almost 2%.  Markets likely panicked in part because when the unemployment ticked up to 4.3% last month \u2014 the highest since October 2021 \u2014 it set off the so-called Sahm Rule. Named for former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, the rule holds that a recession is almost always underway already if the three-month average unemployment rate rises by half a percentage point from its low of the past year. It\u2019s been triggered in every U.S. recession since 1970.  But Sahm herself doubts that a recession is \u201cimminent.\u2019\u2019 Speaking before the numbers came out Friday, she said: \u201cIf the Sahm Rule were to trigger, it would join the ever-growing group of indicators, rules of thumb, that weren\u2019t up to the task.\u2019\u2019 Other previously trustworthy recession indicators that have flopped in the post-pandemic era include: \u2014 A bond market measure with a dry-as-dust label: The \u201cinverted yield curve.\u2019\u2019 \u2014 The rule of thumb that two consecutive quarters of falling economic output amounts to a \u201ctechnical recession.\u2019\u2019 On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he is aware of the Sahm Rule and its implications, but noted that other recession signals, such as changes in bond yields, haven\u2019t been borne out in recent years. \u201cThis pandemic era has been one in which so many apparent rules have been flouted,\u201d Powell said at a news conference. \u201cMany received pieces of received wisdom just haven\u2019t worked, and it\u2019s because the situation really is unusual or unique.\u201d  Powell spoke after Fed officials kept their key interest rate unchanged but signaled that they could reduce the rate as soon as their next meeting in September. Powell also downplayed the impact of the Sahm Rule, calling it a \u201cstatistical regularity.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like an economic rule where it\u2019s telling you something must happen,\u201d he said.  For four years, economists have struggled to make sense of an economy that was first shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic, then roared back with such strength that it revived inflationary pressures that had lain dormant for four decades. When the Federal Reserve moved to tame price increases by aggressively raising interest rates starting in March 2022, economists almost uniformly predicted that the higher borrowing costs would cause a recession. It never came. Post-pandemic trends in the American jobs market may have at least temporarily sapped the Sahm Rule of its potency.  Unemployment has been rising steadily not so much because companies are slashing jobs but because so many people have poured into the job market. Not all of them have found work right away. The new arrivals have been dominated by immigrants \u2014 many of whom entered the country illegally. They are less likely to respond to Labor Department jobs surveys and therefore can go uncounted as employed. The inverted yield curve, meanwhile, is also seen as a recession signal because of the expectation that a recession occurs when the Fed rapidly boosts its benchmark interest rate, which it raised 11 times in 2022 and 2023. An inverted yield curve occurs when the interest rate on shorter-term Treasury bonds, such two-year notes, rises above the rate on a longer-term bond, such as the 10-year Treasury. The switch happened in July 2022 and yields have been inverted ever since, the longest inversion on record.  Typically, longer-term bonds have higher yields to compensate investors for locking up their money for an extended period of time. When shorter-term bonds start paying out higher yields instead, it usually occurs because markets expect the Fed to crank up its short-term rate to quell inflation or cool the economy. Such steps often lead to a recession.  An inverted yield curve has preceded each of the last 10 recessions, according to Deutsche Bank, usually by about one to two years. It did provide one false signal in 1967, when an inversion occurred but no downturn followed. Why hasn\u2019t it been right, so far, this time?  David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says that historically the yield curve inverts in part because longer-term yields fall on the expectation that the Fed will cut rates once the economy falls into recession. Yet investors have been expecting the Fed to cut rates because inflation is falling, Kelly said, not in anticipation of a downturn. \u201cThe perception of why the Federal Reserve might cut short rates right now is quite different to the past, and that\u2019s why the yield curve is not nearly as ominous as it has been in previous episodes,\u201d Kelly said. And Tiffany Wilding, an economist and managing director at bond giant PIMCO, says the government\u2019s huge financial assistance packages, totaling roughly $5 trillion in 2020 and 2021, enriched consumers and business alike. As a result, they have been able to spend and invest without borrowing as much, muting the impact of the Fed\u2019s rate hikes and dulling the signal from the inverted yield curve. Also in 2022, the government reported that gross domestic product \u2014 the economy\u2019s output of goods and services \u2014 had fallen for two straight quarters, a long-time rule of thumb that has nearly always accompanied a recession. Then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the U.S. economy was in recession that month. He turned out to be wrong. True, the top-line economic numbers showed that output was falling. But another measure in the GDP report told a different story: Stripping out volatile items such as inventories, government spending and imports, it showed that the underlying economy continued to expand at a healthy pace.  Economists are concerned that last month\u2019s rise in the jobless rate could portend a broader slowdown. Yet consumers, particularly higher-income ones, are still increasing their spending, and as long as layoffs remain low, they are likely to keep doing so.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me like the U.S. economy has fallen out of bed,\u201d said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price\u2019s fixed income division. \u201cI\u2019m still not in the camp that the U.S. economy is headed for a hard landing.\u201d Associated Press Writer Josh Boak contributed to this report. "

Shapiro and Kelly had been viewed as among the front-runners during her truncated selection process, which began with the vetting of about a dozen names. Some have publicly withdrawn from consideration, such as North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is close with Harris from their shared time as state attorneys general but expressed concern about regularly traveling out of the state if he were to be on the national Democratic ticket. Her deadline for picking a running mate is effectively Tuesday, when Harris will launch a tour of seven key battleground states, starting in Philadelphia.  President Joe Biden told reporters Friday that he has spoken to Harris about her search for a vice presidential candidate, but when asked whether he had advice for the qualities she should look for in a running mate, the president publicly demurred. \n \u201cI\u2019ll let her work that out,\u201d Biden said on the South Lawn of the White House before departing for Wilmington, Delaware, for the weekend. Some of the people on Harris\u2019 short list had abruptly cancelled their plans for this weekend, signaling that something could be afoot in the vice-presidential selection process. For example, Shapiro scrapped three weekend fundraisers in the seaside communities on the coast of Long Island, New York, and his press secretary, Manuel Bonder, offered little explanation as to why. \u201cThe governor\u2019s trip was planned several weeks ago and included several fundraisers for his own campaign committee,\u201d Bonder said in a statement. \u201cHis schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to the Hamptons this weekend.\u201d One Shapiro fundraiser was to be hosted by Michael Kempner, a member of President Joe Biden \u2018s national finance committee. Kempner said in a note to invitees that the gathering had been postponed and openly advocated for Shapiro to be Harris\u2019 No. 2, writing that \u201cmany are speculating that this is a sign he will be the vice president.\u201d What to know about the 2024 Election Meanwhile, a video put on social media by Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker -- who is publicly supporting Shapiro for vice president -- caused a stir Friday. It showed a number of Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris for president, but also touting Shapiro for vice president, suggesting to some that Parker may have inside knowledge about Harris\u2019 decision. However, a person with knowledge of the mayor\u2019s thinking said the video was simply the mayor showing support for both Harris and the potential that Shapiro, Parker\u2019s friend, will be her vice presidential running mate. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Associated Press writer Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pa., contributed to this report. "

Later, he got certified to lead support groups every other week for the National Mental Health Alliance, an organization for relatives of people with mental illness. Altogether, Kellert, 71, volunteers about 30 hours a month. The experience keeps him active, but just as important, he said, it has led to new friendships and a sense of purpose he never expected in retirement. \u201cThat together with a good sense of self-esteem and self-confidence \u2014 I feel like I\u2019m doing something productive,\u201d said Kellert, of Albany, New York. \u201cRetirement\u2019s not what it used to be, sitting on your rocking chair knitting. It\u2019s so much more.\u201d Volunteering also may help him live longer, providing what various studies have shown are a variety of health and psychological benefits. Jacquelyn Stephens, a developmental-health psychologist at the nonprofit Mather Institute, in Evanston, Illinois, researches how to age well. She said volunteering would be good even if it didn\u2019t have so many benefits. \u201cBut it just so happens that it does, and especially for older adults,\u201d she said. Eric S. Kim, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia Vancouver, said his research has found a connection between volunteering and more positive emotions, less loneliness and more social support. This article is part of AP\u2019s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. \u201cThese things have downstream effects, such as increased healthy behaviors, as well as increased healthier biological function such as reduced inflammation,\u201d said Kim. \n It\u2019s not just older adults who benefit, though they are the most-studied group. There are indications that volunteering helps high school students too. Stephens noted that some types of volunteer opportunities, like loading boxes at a food bank, include physical activity. But the work doesn\u2019t have to be physical to be beneficial, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like exercise, that the best kind of volunteering is the one you\u2019ll actually do,\u201d she said, noting that the only risk is overcommitting, which would negate health benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to be stressed out about your volunteer commitment.\u201d Stephens said many people might not volunteer because at first they only think of a few common options that don\u2019t appeal to them, like tutoring or providing food to the needy. Instead, she suggested reaching out to your social network to learn about opportunities that others have enjoyed. Doing so helps to vet an organization for a good environment for volunteers, and encourages people to get involved with a friend or relative in ways that deepen their bonds. Other good places to start are AmeriCorps and aggregator websites such as VolunteerMatch, which pairs a person\u2019s skills with opportunities in their area. Kellert recommended simply searching online for \u201cvolunteer opportunities in my town,\u201d but he also suggested doing a little soul searching before you retire. \u201cA lot of the time it\u2019s right in front of you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you love?

        "body": "President Vladimir Putin strode along the red carpet between two rows of rifle-toting honor guards and warmly greeted intelligence operatives freed in the biggest prisoner swap with the West since the Cold War. \u201cThe Motherland hasn\u2019t forgotten about you for a minute,\u201d Putin said, embracing each of them after they walked down the steps of the jetliner that ferried them home. Putin, who rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 travels to the airport to greet foreign heads of state these days, was delivering a clear, morale-boosting message to his security services: If you get caught, Russia will bring you home. Russian President Vladimir Putin, second right, Federal Security Service (FSB) director Alexander Bortnikov, right, and Russian Foreign Intelligence Service chief Sergei Naryshkin, third left, greet freed Russian prisoners upon their arrival at Vnukovo government airport outside Moscow, Russia, Aug. 1, 2024. (Mikhail Voskresensky, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) For the Kremlin, Vadim Krasikov, the hitman imprisoned in Germany for killing a former Chechen militant in Berlin, was perhaps the most important component in the exchange that saw eight Russians swapped for 16 Westerners and Russian dissidents who had been imprisoned in recent years. Moscow freed American journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and a group of top dissidents. Washington extolled it as a major diplomatic victory. But so did Moscow. \u201cPutin is sending a signal that those working abroad will have maximum protection, and that if they are arrested, the state will fight for their return and roll out the red carpet for them,\u201d said Tatyana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. She noted that Russian and Western perceptions of the deal were starkly different. \n \u201cIn the West, it\u2019s being viewed from a humanitarian and political perspective, closely followed by media, significant for society,\u201d Stanovaya told The Associated Press. \u201cIn Russia, it\u2019s not an issue for society, it\u2019s an issue for the state.\u201d The average Russian probably \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know the names of those who returned,\u201d she added. \u201cBut for Putin, those who returned to Russia are real heroes, patriots who worked for the state and defended the national interest.\u201d Krasikov was convicted in the Aug. 23, 2019, killing of Zelimkhan \u201cTornike\u201d Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.  At his sentencing to life in prison in 2021, German judges said Krasikov had acted on the orders of Russian authorities, who gave him the resources to carry out the killing. In 2019, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any Russian involvement in the killing. But on Friday, he said Krasikov is an officer of the Federal Security Service and once served in the FSB\u2019s special forces Alpha unit, along with some of Putin\u2019s bodyguards. By including Krasikov in the deal, \u201cPutin has shown how important it is to him to secure the return of imprisoned Russian spies,\u201d said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. He noted the Russian leader\u2019s \u201cdetermination to get Krasikov back was key to this exchange.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, speaks to released Russian prisoners upon their arrival at the Vnukovo government airport outside Moscow, Russia, on Thursday, Aug. 1, 2024. (Kirill Zykov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) Russia released twice as many people as the West in what Gould-Davies described as a \u201cstriking departure from the strict parity (or better) that Russia always insisted on in previous swaps.\u201d When it suits him, Putin has occasionally accepted unequal exchanges. In September 2022, Ukraine agreed to free jailed opposition leader Viktor Medvedchuk, whom Putin had personally known, and dozens of other people in exchange for over 200 Ukrainians and foreigners in Russian captivity. Gould-Davies said Putin, a KGB veteran, could have been driven by a strong personal loyalty to the undercover agents in Thursday\u2019s swap. \u201cPutin now places such a high value on his spies that he is prepared to agree to an unfavorable exchange,\u201d he said. Abbas Gallyamov, a political analyst and former Putin speechwriter, described the swap as a way to ensure the loyalty of Russian operatives abroad and make them realize that he \u201cwill make every effort to pull them out of prison.\u201d \u201cPutin showed to all his spies, killers and other people who he uses abroad that he\u2019s like their father,\u201d Gallyamov said. \u201cIt\u2019s important because it ensures their loyalty.\u201d Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of the Putin-chaired Security Council, declared on his messaging app channel that while \u201cit would be desirable to see the traitors of Russia rot behind bars ... it\u2019s more useful to get our guys out.\u201d  The anti-Western hawk added ominously that \u201cthe traitors should now frantically be choosing new names and hiding under witness protection programs.\u201d Among those released by Russia were Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer serving 25 years on a treason conviction widely seen as politically motivated; opposition activist Ilya Yashin, imprisoned for his criticism of the war in Ukraine; associates of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and Oleg Orlov, a veteran human rights campaigner. While some have voiced hope the freed activists could reinvigorate Russia\u2019s beleaguered and fragmented opposition that has lacked a charismatic leader since Navalny\u2019s death, others point to steep challenges they will face.  Stanovaya said it would be hard for them to make their voices heard in Russia, where most people lack access to independent media and liberal views are shared by a relatively narrow segment of the public. She predicted the Kremlin will portray them as serving Western interests, especially Kara-Murza, a dual Russian-British citizen who was a vocal supporter of sanctions against Moscow. Gallyamov also said the Kremlin doesn\u2019t view the freed activists as a major threat. \u201cReleased opposition figures won\u2019t cause any additional issues\u201d for the Kremlin, he said, adding that the messages that Yashin and others sent from prison evoked more sympathy and interest. \u201cThe Kremlin wins from this deal.\u201d Associated Press journalist Kostya Manenkov in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report."

        "body": "As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to announce her running mate, a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that several of the top contenders for the role are largely unknown to Americans. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly stands out as one with more name recognition and higher favorability, particularly among Democrats. The survey, which was conducted after President Joe Biden announced he was withdrawing from the race and Harris became the likely Democratic presidential nominee, highlights the strengths and weaknesses that different politicians could bring to the ticket \u2014 and the challenges they could face if selected.  Kelly, while better known and liked than some of the alternatives, is still unfamiliar to about half of Americans. And others, like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, while less known nationally, could draw on a deeper well of support in their home states and regions. Kelly and Shapiro are viewed among the front-runners, according to people familiar with the process, after the Harris campaign began its vetting with about a dozen names. Harris said Tuesday she had not yet decided on her No. 2. But she, and whomever she selects, will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, next week. Of the four potential Democratic vice-presidential candidates included in the poll \u2013 Kelly, Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who publicly removed himself from consideration after the poll was fielded \u2014 Kelly has the highest name recognition and favorability, according to the AP-NORC poll. FILE - Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., speaks about the southern border outside the West Wing of the White House, Tuesday, June 4, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) \n Americans are more likely to have a positive view of Kelly than a negative view. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults have a very or somewhat favorable view of Kelly, while about 2 in 10 have a negative view. Drawing more good feelings than bad is a relative rarity in presidential politics these days: Biden and former President Donald Trump have been viewed more negatively than positively for several years now. Like many of the other contenders, though, Kelly is nowhere near a household name. About half of Americans don\u2019t know enough to have an opinion about him.  But Democrats are especially likely to have warm feelings about Kelly. Forty-five percent have a favorable view of Kelly. Only about 1 in 10 have an unfavorable view of him, and around 4 in 10 don\u2019t know enough to say. Older Democrats \u2014 those 45 and older \u2014 are especially likely to have a positive view of Kelly, while younger Democrats are more likely to be unfamiliar with him.  What to know about the 2024 Election He\u2019s proven to be a battle-tested campaigner, winning a special election in 2020 to flip the Arizona Senate seat from Republican control and then retaining it two years later for a full, six-year term. The Navy veteran is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and has been an influential voice among Democrats on immigration and border security, long a political vulnerability for Harris that Republicans are seeking to exploit.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Shapiro is broadly unknown to Americans and Democrats, except in the Northeast, where he has more name recognition and higher favorability. The poll found that 6 in 10 U.S. adults \u2014 including 57% of Democrats \u2014 don\u2019t know enough to have an opinion about Shapiro. About 2 in 10 Americans view him favorably, and a similar share view him unfavorably.  The picture isn\u2019t very different among Democrats. About one-quarter of Democrats have a positive view of Shapiro, while 16% have a negative view. Older Democrats are more likely than younger ones to have a favorable opinion of Shapiro, but overall, most have yet to develop a view. Shapiro was elected governor in 2022, defeating Republican Doug Mastriano \u2014 a controversial figure who drew opposition and criticism from members of his own party, including then-GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. Unlike the other contenders asked about in the AP-NORC poll, though, he\u2019s significantly better known \u2014 and liked \u2014 in his home region. In the Northeast, 4 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of him. Another 4 in 10, roughly, don\u2019t know enough to have an opinion of him, while about 2 in 10 Northeasterners view him negatively. Democrat Gary Hines, a 68-year-old in Philadelphia, had high praise for his home-state governor and added: \u201cI\u2019d hate to see him leave, because he\u2019s just getting started in Pennsylvania.\u201d  Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear addresses a crowd gathered at the Breathitt Co. Courthouse to discuss progress in flood recovery efforts in Jackson, Ky., Friday, July 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley) If chosen, Beshear would need to introduce himself to most of the country. Around 7 in 10 Americans don\u2019t know enough to have an opinion about him. Those with a view are about evenly split: 17% of U.S. adults have a positive view, and 15% have a negative one. However, Democrats have a more positive than negative opinion of Beshear. About one-quarter have a very or somewhat favorable view, while around 1 in 10 have a negative view. Nearly two-thirds don\u2019t know enough about Beshear to give an opinion. The scion of a well-known Democratic family in the state, Beshear defeated then-Gov. Matt Bevin \u2014 a deeply unpopular figure, even in conservative Kentucky \u2014 then won reelection in 2023 against Republican Daniel Cameron, a longtime prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Beshear\u2019s victory last year was credited in part to his advocacy of abortion rights, including a campaign ad that featured a sexual assault survivor attacking Cameron for his stances. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz listens as Maryland speaks to reporters after meeting with President Joe Biden, Wednesday, July 3, 2024, at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Like the other governors who are being discussed, Gov. Tim Walz doesn\u2019t have much of a national profile \u2014 and that also means he\u2019s a relatively blank slate. He wasn\u2019t included in the AP-NORC poll, but a new ABC News/Ipsos poll, which asked about favorability slightly differently, found that about 9 in 10 U.S. adults don\u2019t know enough to have an opinion on him. Among Americans with a view, opinions are split between positive and negative. Walz, who also served for 12 years in the House, moved up on Harris\u2019 shortlist in recent days after he coined \u201cweird\u201d as a new talking point to describe the Republican ticket. It\u2019s a line now used widely by the vice president and other Democrats.  He currently leads the Democratic Governors Association.  The poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. AP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.

        "body": "ZEITA, West Bank (AP) \u2014 Two Israeli airstrikes in the West Bank killed nine Palestinian militants on Saturday, Israel\u2019s army said, as violence flared again in the Israeli-occupied territory with tensions high over the war in Gaza. Cease-fire discussions on Gaza were set to continue, with an Israeli delegation led by the Mossad chief arriving in Cairo, an Egyptian official said. The U.S. has urged Israel to seize the chance for a cease-fire after the shock killing of Hamas\u2019 political leader in Iran, which Tehran blames on Israel. In the northern West Bank, the Israeli army said its forces first struck a vehicle in a rural area outside the city of Tulkarem early morning, killing the five occupants. The army said they were on their way to carry out an attack. Hamas identified all five as militants with the group, including a local commander. According to an Associated Press journalist and witnesses, the blast took place along a road connecting the Palestinian villages of Zeita and Qaffin. \u201cWe came to the site and found a young man martyred here on the street and half of his face was missing.,\u201d said Taiser Abdullah, a Zeita resident. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said four bodies were \u201cburned and charred beyond recognition.\u201d Palestinians gather around a car destroyed in a drone strike Zeita village, north of the West Bank city of Tulkarem, Saturday, Aug. 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed) Palestinians inspect a car destroyed in a drone strike Zeita village, north of the West Bank city of Tulkarem, Saturday, Aug. 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed) Later Saturday, Israel\u2019s military said it killed four other Palestinian militants in the Tulkarem area shortly after they opened fire on Israeli troops. No further information was immediately available. \n Over 590 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war began in Gaza in October, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Most have been killed during Israeli raids and violent protests. The dead also include bystanders and Palestinians killed in attacks by Jewish settlers. The northern West Bank has seen some of the territory\u2019s worst violence. Tulkarem is regularly raided by Israeli forces, and Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, are active there. Concerns about a full-fledged regional war are high after the assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran early Wednesday and top Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur in Beirut the evening before. Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, vowed to retaliate against Israel, which said it killed Shukur but has not confirmed or denied its role in Haniyeh\u2019s death. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard said a short-range projectile was behind the killing and accused the United States of supporting the attack. The Pentagon said late Friday that the U.S. military will move a fighter jet squadron to the Middle East and maintain an aircraft carrier in the region. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut encouraged citizens who wish to leave Lebanon \u201cto book any ticket available to them,\u201d noting that several airlines have suspended or canceled flights. The previous day, President Joe Biden said he had urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize the chance for a cease-fire with Hamas, adding that Haniyeh\u2019s killing had \u201cnot helped\u201d efforts to negotiate an end to the war. Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities. Saturday midday, an Israeli delegation led by Mossad chief David Barnea arrived in Cairo, an Egyptian official said. The delegation, which also includes Ronan Bar, chief of Israel\u2019s internal security agency Shin Bet, will meet with Abbas Kamel, head of Egypt\u2019s General Intelligence Service, for talks focusing on the Philadelphi corridor along the border with Egypt and the Rafah crossing point, the official said. The Egyptian official, who has direct knowledge of the Gaza cease-fire negotiations, spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to brief reporters. There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials. Netanyahu\u2019s office late Friday said he ordered the negotiation delegation to leave for Cairo on Saturday or Sunday. The death toll inside Gaza is nearing 40,000. At least 39,550 Palestinians have been killed in the nearly 10 months since Hamas\u2019 brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel triggered their latest war. That\u2019s according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. Israel has accused Hamas of embedding in the civilian population and putting it at risk. Most of Gaza\u2019s population of about 2.3 million is displaced, many people multiple times, as Israel\u2019s military returns to areas where it says Hamas militants have regrouped. Health services and sanitation have largely collapsed across the territory as hunger grows. \u2014\u2014 Jeffery reported from Ramallah, West Bank.

        "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio\u2019s historical society announced a deal Thursday that will allow it to take control of an ancient ceremonial and burial earthworks site located on the site of a golf course, ending years of litigation. Ohio History Connection will pay Moundbuilders Country Club in Newark to buy out its lease and end the long-running legal dispute over the Octagon Earthworks, although the sum is confidential under a settlement agreement. The deal avoids a jury trial to determine the site\u2019s fair market value that had been repeatedly postponed over the years. The Octagon Earthworks are among eight ancient areas in the Hopewell Earthworks system that were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site last year. The historical society, a nonprofit state history organization, takes control of them on Jan. 1 and plans to open them to visitors.  \u201cOur guiding principles throughout this process have been to enable full public access to the Octagon Earthworks while ensuring Moundbuilders Country Club receives just compensation for the value of its lease on the property,\u201d said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection. \u201cAnd now we have accomplished those things.\u201d David Kratoville, president of the country club\u2019s board of trustees, said he has mixed feelings about coming to the end of the legal battle. He said negotiations over the past two months finally landed on a figure \u201cthat allows us to survive,\u201d but the future of the club remains in limbo. \n Moundbuilders is in negotiations to buy another property, the nearby public golf course Trout Club, but members gathered at an emotional meeting Monday where owners were unable to make promises for the future, he said. \u201cFor me, the news will be where do we land after 114 years operating on this site,\u201d he said.  Built between 2,000 and 1,600 years ago by people from the Hopewell Culture, the earthworks were host to ceremonies that drew people from across the continent, based on archeological discoveries of raw materials from as far west as the Rocky Mountains.  Native Americans constructed the earthworks, including eight long earthen walls, that correspond to lunar movements and align with points where the moon rises and sets over the 18.6-year lunar cycle. The History Connection calls them \u201cpart cathedral, part cemetery and part astronomical observatory.\u201d The historical society owns the disputed earthworks site, but it had been leased to the country club for decades. History Connection had put the value of the site at about $2 million, while the country club was seeking a much higher amount. In 1892, voters in surrounding Licking County enacted a tax increase to preserve what was left of the earthworks. The area was developed as a golf course in 1911, and the state first deeded the 134-acre property to Moundbuilders Country Club in 1933. A county judge ruled in 2019 that the historical society could reclaim the lease via eminent domain. But the club challenged the attempt to take the property, saying the History Connection didn\u2019t make a good- faith offer to purchase the property as required by state law. The country club argued that it had provided proper upkeep of the mound and allowed public access over the years \u2014 albeit only a few days a year.  Charles Moses, president of the organization\u2019s board of trustees, said the History Connection is excited for the location to be \u201cfully open to the citizens of Ohio \u2014 and the world.\u201d  The settlement will be shared with the judge later this month and the case closed.

        "body": "NANTERRE, France (AP) \u2014 In another disappointment for the American swim team, Simone Manuel was eliminated in the preliminaries of the 50-meter freestyle at the Paris Olympics on Saturday. Manuel posted the 18th-fastest time in the hectic sprint covering one length of the pool, not good enough to make it to the evening semifinals. The first Black woman to win an individual gold medal in swimming touched in 24.87 seconds, 0.15 out of the time she needed to crack the top 16 and a whopping 1.02 behind the fastest qualifier, Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m of Sweden. Manuel stormed off the deck and right past reporters. Asked to stop for a question, she replied \u201cnope\u201d and kept on going. The United States went into the next-to-last day of the competition with 21 medals but only four golds, a performance that has fallen short of expectations for the world\u2019s dominant swim nation.  Several high-profile swimmers have failed to even make the finals in some of their best events.  Caeleb Dressel, a star of the Tokyo Olympics with five gold medals, was knocked out in the semis of the 100 butterfly and broke down in tears after leaving the deck.  Ryan Murphy, a longtime stalwart in the backstroke, managed a bronze in the 100 back and was knocked out in the semis of the 200 \u2014 far short of his goal to reclaim the titles he swept at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. Manuel came up short, too, in her comeback from overtraining syndrome, which plagued her preparations for the Tokyo Olympics. She won a silver in the 50 freestyle at the 2016 Rio Games, to go along with her historic gold in the 100 free. \n The Americans are intent of finishing strong, with several events they are favored to win over the last two days. But it\u2019s shaping up to be their lowest gold-medal total since they were limited to eight at the 1988 Seoul Games, which were led by an East German team that was later revealed to have a massive, state-sponsored doping operation. \u201cI think there\u2019s a bit of realization of just how much the world has caught up,\u201d said American swimmer Jack Alexy. \u201cWe\u2019re still doing the best we can and we\u2019re still swimming fast.\u201d As if he hasn\u2019t done enough already, L\u00e9on Marchand returned to the pool to lead France to the top qualifying time in the men\u2019s 4x100 medley relay. Swimming the breaststroke leg, Marchand helped the French finish in 3 minutes, 31.36 seconds. He was joined on the team by Yohann Ndoye-Brouard, Clement Secchi and Rafael Fente-Damers. In the final Sunday, it will be a struggle for Marchand to add another gold to the four individual victories he already has. The United States has won the event at every Olympics except the boycotted 1980 Games since it was added to the program in 1960. The Americans qualified third in the heats at 3:31.62. \u201cI think it\u2019s the last (event) of the Olympic Games in France at home, so it\u2019s going to be crazy,\u201d Marchand said in French. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to enjoy it.\u201d Coming off his win in the 200 individual medley, he conceded, \u201cIt was hard to get up this morning. I didn\u2019t sleep very well, obviously. I\u2019m a little tired.\u201d AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"

        "body": "Swallowing a handful of pills is a daily ritual for many people, from young adults coping with anxiety to older adults managing chronic conditions. Overall, 13% of people in the U.S. take five or more prescription drugs. For those 65 and older, that number is 42%. If you\u2019re taking multiple meds, it\u2019s smart to be aware of potential problems. One pill can lead to a side effect, leading to another pill and another side effect in what experts call a \u201cprescribing cascade.\u201d Some drugs can cause harm if taken for years. Others stop working or interact badly with a new drug. A drug tolerated well at first can cause side effects later, leading to cognitive decline and injuries from falls. \u201cOur metabolism changes as we get older,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Bayliss, who studies deprescribing at Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Institute for Health Research in Aurora, Colorado. \u201cEveryone\u2019s ability to metabolize the medications they\u2019ve been taking for a long time may change.\u201d The nonprofit Lown Institute calls the whole situation a medication overload that will cause 4.6 million hospital visits this decade. If your daily pill routine is getting out of hand, ask for a medication review. Here\u2019s how to get started with a process called \u201cdeprescribing.\u201d Start with a professional you trust, like a doctor or pharmacist, said Lisa McCarthy, a pharmacist and deprescribing expert at the University of Toronto.  This article is part of AP\u2019s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. If you\u2019re asking your doctor, don\u2019t wait until the end of a 15-minute visit. Instead, make a dedicated appointment and tell them when booking you want to talk about your medicines, McCarthy said.  \n Your doctor may not have the full picture of what you\u2019re taking if other prescribers are involved, and some doctors hesitate to manage drugs prescribed by others. That\u2019s when a pharmacist can help by reviewing everything and writing up suggestions you can share with your doctors, said pharmacist Bradley Phillips of the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. \u201cWe\u2019re considered the medication experts,\u201d Phillips said. Swelling, incontinence, restlessness, insomnia \u2014 all are side effects caused by common medications that sometimes get treated with new drugs. McCarthy wants people to ask their doctors a simple question: Could this symptom be related to one of my medications? \u201cIf we could teach the public to ask that question it would be very powerful,\u201d McCarthy said. And for a follow-up question, she suggested: Do I still need this medicine? Pharmacist Barbara Farrell sees dramatic changes in many people she helps at an outpatient geriatric center in Ottawa, Ontario. Some have emerged from a drug-induced dementia after their meds are reduced. A 77-year-old woman was able to leave her wheelchair and walk with a cane after cutting her daily pills from 32 to 17. She had arrived sedated and unable to communicate, and a few months later, she was back to her hobby of knitting. Some meds can be stopped abruptly but others require a slow taper to prevent uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms \u2014 or even life-threatening seizures. Tapering to progressively lower doses is particularly important with drugs for depression, insomnia and anxiety. After two decades on various pills for these conditions, therapist Molly Bernardi of Spokane, Washington, began tapering down her doses. The 45-year-old suspected the pills were the cause of her worsening problems with digestion, balance, memory, stiff muscles and flickering dots across her field of vision. When scans ruled out other illnesses, she gradually stopped each of four medications. \u201cIt\u2019s been by far the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Bernardi said. One of the final drugs she stopped was the toughest: a benzodiazepine, a class of sedatives that can be harmful if taken long term. Over the course of three months, she used a kitchen knife and a nail file to cut her 1 milligram daily pill into ever-smaller pieces.  She listened to her body, found support groups on Facebook and used breathwork and prayer to get through withdrawal symptoms. \u201cNow when I have a good day, a good hour, a good moment, it\u2019s peace and presence like I\u2019ve never known since before I was medicated,\u201d Bernardi said. \u201cI\u2019m just experiencing a little bit of great. And a little bit of great is so great that it keeps me going.\u201d Even in the best-connected health care systems, McCarthy said, information about prescriptions isn\u2019t always shared among doctors. And they won\u2019t know about your over-the-counter drugs, vitamins or nightly CBD gummy.  The only person who knows everything you take is you, McCarthy said. So keep a current list of what you take, why it was prescribed and when you started taking it.  For an example of a medication list, which McCarthy called a \u201ctremendously powerful\u201d tool, look at the workshop materials she and her colleagues designed.

        "body": "DERIDDER, La. (AP) \u2014 A woman who abruptly resigned her mayoral seat in a small southwest Louisiana city a week ago is now facing a rape charge involving a minor. Louisiana State Police arrested Misty Clanton Roberts, 42, on Thursday on charges of third-degree rape and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. She was released from the Beauregard Parish jail after posting $75,000 bond, news outlets reported. It was not immediately known if an arraignment had been scheduled. Sgt. Ross Brennan, a state police spokesman, said the alleged juvenile victim and another juvenile told the state police\u2019s Special Victims Unit that Roberts had sex with the juvenile while Roberts was mayor of DeRidder, a city of about 10,000 people located about 50 miles (80.47 kilometers) north of Lake Charles. Brennan did not provide details of the alleged victims\u2019 age, gender or hometown. Roberts\u2019 arrest came less than a week after she abruptly resigned. She submitted a letter of resignation to the city council on July 27 after previously telling Council Clerk Glenna Luther, also in a letter, that she was taking an unplanned two-week leave and had appointed Fire Chief Ken Harlow as acting mayor in her absence. Adam Johnson, Roberts\u2019 attorney, in a statement to KPLC-TV, said his client is innocent.  \u201cShe has not been charged with a crime and/or convicted of any crime,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd we trust the public will respect her constitutional presumption of innocence which is fundamental to our system of justice. Misty and her family are very grateful for the support they have received from their friends and neighbors and we look forward to putting this unfortunate situation behind them.\u201d Roberts, an independent, became the first woman to hold the office of mayor of DeRidder in 2018. She was serving her second term after winning reelection in 2022."

        "body": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump falsely suggested Kamala Harris had misled voters about her race as the former president appeared Wednesday before the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago in an interview that quickly turned hostile. The Republican former president wrongly claimed that Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don\u2019t know, is she Indian or is she Black?\u201d Trump said while addressing the group\u2019s annual convention. Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both immigrants to the U.S. As an undergraduate, Harris attended Howard University, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent historically Black colleges and universities, where she also pledged the historically Black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. As a U.S. senator, Harris was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, supporting legislation to strengthen voting rights and to reform policing.  AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports Donald Trump has falsely suggested Kamala Harris misled voters about her race. Trump has leveled a wide range of criticism at Harris since she replaced President Joe Biden atop the likely Democratic ticket last week. Throughout his political career, the former president has repeatedly questioned the backgrounds of opponents who are racial minorities. Michael Tyler, the communications director for Harris\u2019 campaign, said in a statement that \u201cthe hostility Donald Trump showed on stage today is the same hostility he has shown throughout his life, throughout his term in office, and throughout his campaign for president as he seeks to regain power.\u201d \n \u201cTrump lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency \u2014 while he failed Black families and left the entire country digging out of the ditch he left us in,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cDonald Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked during her briefing with reporters on Wednesday about Trump\u2019s remarks and responded with disbelief, initially murmuring, \u201cWow.\u201d Jean-Pierre, who is Black, called what Trump said \u201crepulsive\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s insulting and no one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify.\u201d Trump has repeatedly attacked his opponents and critics on the basis of race. He rose to prominence in Republican politics by propagating false theories that President Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first Black president, was not born in the United States. \u201cBirtherism,\u201d as it became known, was just the start of Trump\u2019s history of questioning the credentials and qualifications of Black politicians. What to know about the 2024 Election He has denied allegations of racism. And after Biden picked Harris as his running mate four years ago, a Trump campaign spokesperson then pointed to a previous Trump political donation to Harris as proof that he wasn\u2019t racist.  \u201cThe president, as a private businessman, donated to candidates across all aisles,\u201d the spokesperson, Katrina Pierson, told reporters. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll note that Kamala Harris is a Black woman and he donated to her campaign, so I hope we can squash this racism argument now,\u201d Pierson said. During this year\u2019s Republican primary, he once referred to former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, as \u201cNimbra.\u201d Later Wednesday, Trump did not repeat his criticism of Harris\u2019 race at a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, although he called her \u201cphony\u201d and said she has been trying to change her image. He also repeatedly mispronounced her first name.  \u201cIf she becomes your president, our country is finished,\u201d Trump charged.  Before he took the stage, Trump\u2019s team displayed what appeared to be years-old news headlines describing Harris as the \u201cfirst Indian-American senator\u201d on the big screen in the arena. Trump\u2019s appearance Wednesday at the annual gathering of Black journalists immediately became heated, with the former president sparring with interviewer Rachel Scott of ABC News and accusing her of giving him a \u201cvery rude introduction\u201d with a tough first question about his past criticism of Black people and Black journalists, his attack on Black prosecutors who have pursued cases against him and the dinner he had at his Florida club with a white supremacist. \u201cI think it\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI came here in good spirit. I love the Black population of this country. I\u2019ve done so much for the Black population of this country.\u201d Trump continued his attacks on Scott\u2019s network, ABC News, which he has been arguing should not host the next presidential debate, despite his earlier agreement with the Biden campaign. He also several times described her tone and questions as \u201cnasty,\u201d a word he used in the past when describing women, including Hillary Clinton and Meghan the Duchess of Sussex. The Republican also repeated his false claim that immigrants in the country illegally are \u201ctaking Black jobs.\u201d When pushed by Scott on what constituted a \u201cBlack job,\u201d Trump responded by saying \u201ca Black job is anybody that has a job,\u201d drawing groans from the room. At one point, he said, \u201cI have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln.\u201d  The audience responded with a mix of boos and some applause. Scott asked Trump about his pledge to pardon people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and specifically whether he would pardon those who assaulted police officers.  Trump said, \u201cOh, absolutely I would,\u201d and said, \u201cIf they\u2019re innocent, I would pardon them.\u201d Scott pointed out they have been convicted and therefore are not innocent. \u201cWell, they were convicted by a very, very tough system,\u201d he said.  At one point, when he was defending his supporters who entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, he said, \u201cNothing is perfect in life.\u201d  He compared the 2021 insurrection to the protests in Minneapolis and other cities in 2020 following the death of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and to more recent protests at the Capitol last week by demonstrators opposed to the war in Gaza. Trump falsely claimed that no one was arrested in those other demonstrations and that only his supporters were targeted.  As Trump made the comparison, a man in the back of the room shouted out, \u201cSir, have you no shame?\u201d The former president\u2019s invitation to address the organization sparked an intense internal debate among NABJ that spilled online. Organizations for journalists of color typically invite presidential candidates to speak at their summer gatherings in election years. As he campaigns for the White House a third time, Trump has sought to appear outside his traditional strongholds of support and his campaign has touted his efforts to try to win over Black Americans, who have been Democrats\u2019 most committed voting bloc. His campaign has emphasized his messages on the economy and immigration as part of his appeal, but some of his outreach has played on racial stereotypes, including the suggestion that African Americans would empathize with the criminal charges he has faced and his promotion of branded sneakers.  Trump and NABJ also have a tense history over his treatment of Black women journalists. In 2018, NABJ condemned Trump for repeatedly using words such as \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201closer\u201d and \u201cnasty\u201d to describe Black women journalists. The vice president is not scheduled to appear at the convention, but NABJ said in a statement posted on X that it was in conversation with her campaign to have her appear either virtually or in person for a conversation in September. Harris addressed Trump\u2019s comments briefly Wednesday night while speaking at a gathering of Sigma Gamma Rho, a historically Black sorority, in Houston.  \u201cIt was the same old show,\u201d she said. \u201cThe divisiveness and the disrespect.\u201d Harris added: \u201cAnd let me just say, the American people deserve better.\u201d Price reported from New York. Associated Press writers Aaron Morrison and Steve Peoples in New York, Gary Fields in Chicago and Will Weissert and Farnoush Amiri in Washington, Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Chris Megerian in Houston contributed to this report."

        "body": "SAG HARBOR, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Justin Timberlake made a virtual court appearance Friday in his drunken driving case on Long Island, saying little during the brief proceeding as a judge accepted his not-guilty plea and suspended his right to drive in New York. Police in the seaside village of Sag Harbor arrested Timberlake June 18 after they say he ran a stop sign, veered out of his lane and got out of his BMW smelling of alcohol.  The former NSYNC singer, who is on tour in Europe, wasn\u2019t required by the court to return to the U.S. for his court date. He is performing Saturday night in Antwerp, Belgium. His attorney, Edward Burke Jr., has maintained that Timberlake was not drunk and that the case should be dropped. \u201cThe facts remain he was not intoxicated,\u201d Burke said Friday, according to Newsday. \u201cI\u2019ll say it again: Justin Timberlake was not intoxicated and we\u2019re very confident that charge, that criminal charge, will be dismissed.\u201d Sag Harbor Village Justice Carl Irace suspended Timberlake\u2019s Tennessee driver\u2019s license in New York state and threatened to impose a gag order on Burke, saying the attorney\u2019s comments to the media have been inappropriate. Irace set a next court date for Aug. 9. Timberlake had appeared in court in person previously but his arraignment needed to be repeated because of a paperwork oversight. Burke said the original charging document lacked a police sergeant\u2019s signature. \n Assistant District Attorney Ashley Cangro said new documents were filed July 2 to address that flaw.  Timberlake was pulled over after leaving a Sag Harbor hotel around 12:30 a.m., according to police. \u201cHis eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,\u201d police said in a court filing. Timberlake, 43, told the officer he had had one martini and was following some friends home, according to police. He was arrested and spent the night in custody at a police station."

        "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) \u2014 The ear-splitting roars raining down on the track and field stars in the Stade de France felt like eight years of pent-up energy flowing out at once. They were for distance runner Joshua Cheptegei, who stamped his mark on a masterpiece of a 10,000-meter race to set an Olympic record and win a gold medal.  They were for Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, who opened the meet in the afternoon Friday with a first-round 100-meter sprint that kept her own gold-medal dreams in tact. They were for decathletes, who were showered throughout the afternoon and into the night as they worked their way through their first five events, garnering a show of support that\u2019s \u201cnot too typical for decathlon,\u201d Canada\u2019s defending champion Damian Warner said.  They were even for swimming.  The start of one decathlon heat was delayed about five minutes while the public address announcer begged for quiet and fans waving the French tricolor chanted and cheered for L\u00e9on Marchand\u2019s latest gold medal at the pool.  Cheptegei, who won in an Olympic-record time of 26 minutes, 43.14 seconds, loved every minute of it.  \u201cIt\u2019s the most rewarding that I am winning today in Paris, the most amazing crowd,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crowd was wild. And I knew that when I was going to the front, at the last two laps, I knew that this was going to be amazing for me.\u201d Three years ago in Tokyo, the COVID-19 pandemic kept crowds out of the mix, leaving most of the 2,200 track and field athletes to compete in eerie silence.  \n Cheptegei\u2019s gold was the first won in front of a crowd on the track since the Games in Rio de Janeiro eight years ago. For that, he also got $50,000 and a chance to clang the bell at the end of the stadium, which is reserved for champions only.  The crowd went crazy for that, too.  \u201cI think the 10K doesn\u2019t get a lot of love sometimes,\u201d said Grant Fisher, whose bronze medal marked America\u2019s first podium appearance in this event since 2012. \u201cBut that crowd felt like we were the best show in town.\u201d From start to finish, the night\u2019s biggest race was a barnburner.  It featured 15 runners who had broken 27 minutes in their careers, meaning the 27:01 Olympic record was in peril before the starting gun even went off. Then, a trio of Ethiopians \u2014 Yomif Kejelcha, Selemon Barega and Berihu Aregawi \u2014 made it happen. They set a blistering pace early, stringing out the field and taking turns in the lead through 7,500 meters. For a few laps after that, things got bunched up and the runners were racing three- and four-wide.  \u201cI was surprised how many people were around given how fast the pace was,\u201d Fisher said. Then, it strung out again. Fisher, the 27-year-old American champion trying to join Billy Mills as the second U.S. 10,000-meter champion, stayed in that mix. Out of nowhere, with 500 meters left, surged Cheptegei.  He was in the lead when the bell lap started, and he never gave anyone hope. Fisher lost a lung-searing sprint to Aregawi for second. Cheptegei gave Uganda its first gold medal in the 112-year history of the longest Olympic event on the track.  \u201cEvery athlete there was special,\u201d he said.  Cheptegei adds this to the silver medal he won in Tokyo and the world titles he took in 2019, 2022 and 2023. \u201cNow, my collection is complete,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the world champion. Now, I win the Olympic title. I\u2019m so excited.\u201d Iron woman Sifan Hassan completed the first leg of what is shaping up as a long Olympics. She finished second in the first round of the 5,000 meters. Hassan also plans to run in the 10,000 meters and the marathon. At the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, the Ethiopian-born Dutch runner became the first person to win medals in the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 meters. She realizes that going 3 for 3 might not be in the cards this time, but she plans on trying. \u201cWhen I\u2019m at the start line, I always ask myself: \u2018Why? Why? What is wrong with you?\u2019 But when I go home, I want to do it. It\u2019s a lot about curiosity,\u201d Hassan said. The U.S. mixed 4x400 meter relay team set a world record in an event that is only 5 years old. The team of Vernon Norwood, Shamier Little, Bryce Deadmon and Kaylyn Brown finished the four laps in 3 minutes, 7.41 seconds to break a mark set at the world championships last year. All the record did was place the Americans in Saturday\u2019s final, where the record will be in jeopardy again. Ryan Crouser and Joe Kovacs of the U.S. and Tom Walsh of New Zealand all advanced to the shot put final, giving them a chance at finishing 1-2-3 \u2014 in that exact order \u2014 for the third straight Games. Crouser, who has been dealing with an elbow injury this year, needed only one throw to advance with a mark of 21.49 meters. Also in the mix is Leonardo Fabbri of Italy, whose throw of 21.76 was the evening\u2019s biggest. Jasmine Moore, the first American woman to qualify for the Olympics in both the triple jump and the long jump, kept her work to a minimum. She needed just one jump \u2014 a season-best 14.43 meters \u2014 to lock down her spot in the triple jump finals.  Leyanis Perez Hernandez of Cuba had the night\u2019s best jump (14.68) in an event that has been thrown wide open because of an Achilles tendon injury that ended the season for defending champion and world-record holder Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela this spring.

        "body": "With plans for athletes to swim the Seine River through the heart of Paris, Olympic organizers essentially bet against climate change\u2019s extreme weather. For several days it appeared they would lose \u2014 by ditching the swimming portion of triathlon races. It wasn\u2019t until early Wednesday, after the men\u2019s race had been postponed a day and test events called off, that organizers announced the most recent tests showed the water met standards to allow swimming. Some scientists and engineers said organizers were taking a huge gamble at a time when heavy rains have increased with human-caused climate change, especially in Europe. The rains run off from the urban environment and contribute to higher bacteria levels in the city\u2019s famed river. \u201cThey just gambled, flipped the coin and hope for a dry season and it turned out to be the rainiest in the last 30 years,\u201d said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University who has researched stormwater management.  Organizers \u201chad worked through most of the scenarios related to computer hacking and physical threats without fully assessing the implications of extreme events associated with climate,\u201d said University of Arizona climate scientist Kathy Jacobs, who directs the Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely time to take climate threats seriously.\u201d If any city could be expected to be mindful of the challenges of climate change, it\u2019s Paris. It\u2019s where the most significant climate agreement in history was struck almost a decade ago \u2014 to try to limit Earth\u2019s warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. And the Paris games aspire to have half the carbon footprint of earlier games held in London and Rio de Janeiro. \n Paris, like many older cities around the world, has a combined sewer system, which means that the city\u2019s wastewater and stormwater flow through the same pipes. With heavy or prolonged periods of rain, the pipes\u2019 capacity is reached, sending raw wastewater into the river instead of a treatment plant. Paris spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to improve the water quality in the Seine, including building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from entering the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants. But persistent rains, which dampened the opening ceremonies and temporarily gave way to a heat warning on Tuesday, worked against that. Tuesday\u2019s men\u2019s triathlon was postponed to Wednesday. The city has had at least 80 rainy days in Paris so far this year, about two-and-a-half weeks more than normal, according to the French meteorological office. An AP analysis of weather data found that Paris in 2024 had its second-highest number of rainy days since 1950, surpassed only by 2016. There\u2019s been only one weeklong dry spell this year to give the drainage system a break. Normally there\u2019s at least three by this time, the AP analysis shows. \u201cHeavy rainfall in the summer has always been a possibility and with a warming climate these heavy rainfall events have only become heavier, said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the Imperial College of London. \u201dThus, that definitely would need to have gone into the planning.\u201d A study last week in the journal Science found a noticeable global increase in the variability \u2014 the all-or-nothing quality \u2014 of rain and snow in the past 100 years with a big jump starting in 1960. Researchers then did the standard climate attribution analysis to compare what actually happened with what would have been expected in a fictional world without human-caused climate change. They found this increase in heavy rains punctuated by longer dry spells had global warming\u2019s fingerprints on it. The study also found three areas \u2014 Europe, eastern North America and Australia \u2014 had seen much higher jumps in the increase in rainfall extremes. The laws of physics dictate that warmer air holds more moisture, which comes down as heavier rain, while climate change then changes weather patterns, making them more stuck in downpours or sunny days without clouds, said study co-author Peili Wu, a climate scientist at the United Kingdom Meteorological Office. Organizers said what happened was beyond their control. Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, noted to reporters Tuesday that previous triathlon competitions had sometimes been pared back to duathlons. That was before the early Wednesday announcement that swimming in the Seine would move forward. Duran, the Villanova professor, noted that the acceptable pollution level for the triathlon is nearly four times weaker than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has for swimmable waterways. Paris\u2019 mayor made a public show of swimming in the river earlier this month, something Duran called a publicity stunt. He said he would not swim in the Seine. He called the underground storage basins \u201cthe last thing any stormwater expert would suggest as a solution,\u201d Duran said. Few cities use that solution any more because it\u2019s limited and easily gets overwhelmed by the heavier and more frequent rains of climate change. It\u2019s a solution for the era before global warming kicked in heavily, he said.  Future Olympics sites need to take a wetter world into consideration, Villanova\u2019s Duran said: \u201cThe sewer overflow issue is bound to get worse until climate change is addressed.\u201d Los Angeles, the host city for the 2028 games, could learn a lesson and work toward more green spaces and fewer private vehicles, Imperial College\u2019s Otto said. \u201cOlympic games are a great opportunity to change cities as for some reason people accept that athletes need to have a healthy environment whereas ordinary citizens should live within pollution, traffic, noise and risk their life and health,\u201d Otto said.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Buoyed by an increase in recruiting, the Army will expand its basic combat training in what its leaders hope reflects a turning point as it prepares to meet the challenges of future wars. The added training will begin in October and comes as the Army tries to reverse years of dismal recruiting when it failed to meet its enlistment goals. New units in Oklahoma and Missouri will train as many as 4,000 recruits every year. Army leaders are optimistic they will hit their target of 55,000 recruits this year and say the influx of new soldiers forced them to increase the number of training sites. \u201cI am happy to say last year\u2019s recruiting transformation efforts have us on track to make this year\u2019s recruiting mission, with thousands awaiting basic training\u201d in the next year, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said. Adding the two new locations, she said, is a way to get the soldiers trained and into units quickly, \u201cwith further expansion likely next spring if our recruiting numbers keep improving.\u201d The expanded training is part of a broader effort to restructure the Army so it is better able to fight against a sophisticated adversary such as Russia or China. The U.S. military spent much of the past two decades battling insurgent groups in Iraq and Afghanistan rather than fighting a broader war with another high-tech, more capable nation. Brig. Gen. Jenn Walkawicz, head of operations for the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command, said there will be two new training companies at Fort Sill in Oklahoma and two at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri.  \n Driving the growth is the successful Future Soldier Prep Course, which was created at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022 as a new way to bolster enlistments. That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training. Created two years ago, the program has been cited as a key reason Army leaders expect that this fall they will reverse several years of recruiting shortfalls. In the budget year that ended Sept. 30, the Army brought in a bit more than 50,000 recruits, falling far short of the publicly stated \u201cstretch goal\u201d of 65,000. The Army has 151 training companies overall that work with recruits at Fort Jackson and Fort Moore, Georgia, in addition to the 15 training companies assigned to the prep course. Army leaders have expanded the prep course, which is expected to bring in nearly 20,000 recruits this budget year and that total is expected to spike in 2025. Due to the Army\u2019s recruiting struggles, the number of recruits going through basic training dropped in recent years. As a result, the 15 training units, which total 27 soldiers each, including 16 drill sergeants, were available for the prep course. But as the prep course grows, those units are not available to do basic training. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to mess with that because right now that formula\u2019s working and it\u2019s provided a lot of value for the Army,\u201d Walkawicz said. So, the Army is creating the four new companies and has developed plans for more if needed. She added that Fort Sill and Fort Leonard Wood have the infrastructure, the barracks and the room to accommodate the new units and could take more if needed. The costs of the program are limited because the Army already had the equipment and rooms required, but there will be maintenance, food, staffing and other costs. Army officials did not provide a total price. The move to add units is the latest change in what has been a tumultuous time for the Army. Coming out of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, when the service grew dramatically to fill the nation\u2019s combat needs, the U.S. military began to see recruiting dip.  Unemployment has been low, corporate jobs pay well and offer good benefits, and, according to estimates, just 23% of people age 17 to 24 are physically, mentally and morally qualified to serve without receiving some type of waiver. Moral behavior issues include drug use, gang ties or a criminal record. Those problems were only amplified as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, preventing recruiters from meting with students in person at schools, fairs and other public events.  In 2022, the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000, and the other services had to dig deep into their pools of delayed entry candidates in order to meet their recruiting numbers. Then in 2023, the Army, Navy and Air Force all missed their recruitment targets. The Marine Corps and the tiny Space Force have consistently hit their goals. Partly in response to the recruiting shortfalls, Army leaders slashed the size of the force by about 24,000, or almost 5%. They said many of the cuts were in already vacant jobs."

        "body": "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 A tropical depression over Cuba is growing better organized, forecasters said Saturday, and is likely to bring drenching rain and coastal flooding to much of Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. The storm strengthened into a tropical depression late Friday, and is expected to become a tropical storm by Saturday night, once it has maximum sustained winds of 39 mph (63 kph) or more. If the depression reaches tropical storm status, it would be named Debby, the fourth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. Circulation was centered just south of Cienfuegos, Cuba, on Saturday morning, but associated wind and thunderstorms were spread out over a broad region, including southern Florida, the Florida Keys and the Bahamas. One location in the middle of the Florida Keys island chain was reporting sustained winds of 30 mph (48 kph) on Saturday morning. The National Hurricane Center in Miami forecasts that the depression will strengthen as it curves northward off the southwest Florida coast, where the water has been extremely warm, with temperatures approaching 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius) this week. Predictions show the system could come ashore as strong tropical storm late Sunday or early Monday and cross over northern Florida into the Atlantic Ocean, where it\u2019s likely to remain a tropical storm threatening Georgia and the Carolinas early next week. Tropical storm warnings are posted for most of Florida\u2019s west coast and the Dry Tortugas. A hurricane watch is posted for parts of the Big Bend, recognizing that there is a chance that Debby could reach hurricane status before coming ashore. \n Flat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days when so-called king tides surge in coastal areas. This storm is predicted to push up storm tides of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) along most of Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay, with a higher tide of 3 to 5 feet predicted farther north in Florida\u2019s sparsely populated Big Bend region, where the Florida peninsula bends westward into the state\u2019s Panhandle region. Tropical storms and hurricanes can also trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and the region\u2019s canals. Forecasters are warning of 5 to 10 inches (125 mm to 250 mm) of rain, which could create \u201clocally considerable\u201d flash and urban flooding. Forecasters are also already warning of moderate flooding for some rivers along Florida\u2019s West Coast. Some of the heaviest rains could actually come next week in a region along the Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville, Florida, north through Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina. On Saturday morning, conditions were windy and squally on Long Key, but Scott Battle, operator of Florida Boy Bar and Grill, pronounced things as \u201cfine.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s spitting off and on and blowing a little, but not too bad,\u201d he said by phone.  People in some Florida cities on Friday filled sandbags to protect against possible flooding. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for most Florida counties, extending from the Florida Keys up through Central Florida and the Tampa Bay region and into the western Panhandle. Christina Lothrop is the general manager at Blue Pelican Marina in Hernando Beach, a barrier island about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of St. Petersburg. She said Saturday still seemed like a regular summer day, with the public ramp across the street jammed with people launching boats and people filling local bars and restaurants. \u201cToday it\u2019s kind of normal, which is kind of weird,\u201d Lothrop told The Associated Press by telephone. On the other hand, Lothrop said workers at her marina have been getting ready for the storm since Tuesday. They\u2019re securing boats that are stored on racks, stowing away tool boxes, and tying down anything that could blow around. \u201cRight now what we\u2019re doing is mostly tying up boats,\u201d she said, saying no boats would be left in the water to guard against them coming untied and drifting away or causing damage. Before the marina store closes Saturday, Lothrop said she will lift computers up off the floor and sandbag and tape doors. She said she mostly fears a storm surge. Last year\u2019s Hurricane Idalia pushed about a foot of water (30 centimeters) into the store. Like many Florida coastal developments, Hernando Beach is built around a series of manmade canals that provide easy access to the water, but also act as a highway for storm surge. On Friday, crews pulled floating cranes away from a bridge construction project across Tampa Bay, lashing together 74 barges and 24 floating cranes and anchoring them to try to hold them in place until the storm passes, project engineer Marianne Brinson told the Tampa Bay Times. Crews also laid down cranes on land on their sides. For some Floridians, the name Debby summons up bad memories of a 2012 tropical storm of the same name that caused $250 million in losses and eight deaths, including seven in the Sunshine State. That storm dumped torrential rains all up the Florida Gulf Coast into northern Florida, including an astronomical 29 inches (73 centimeters) at a location south of Tallahassee. Rick Falkenstein, who owns Hurricane Seafood Restaurant in St. Pete Beach, told WTSP-TV that he remembers \u201cthe high tides, the flooding\u201d from that storm. Pinnellas County crews paused a $5 million beach renourishment project necessitated in part by erosion from past storms. Meanwhile, far off Mexico\u2019s western coast, Hurricane Carlotta continued moving westward, deeper into the Pacific Ocean on Saturday, with top sustained winds reaching 90 mph (145 kph). The hurricane center said Carlotta may strengthen a little more, but should begin losing strength on Sunday as it moves into an area of unfavorable winds and drier air. The storm is likely to dissipate into a remnant of thunderstorms in three to four days. No watches or warnings are in effect."

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks tumbled Friday on worries the U.S. economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to whip inflation. The S&P 500 sank 1.8% for its first back-to-back losses of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4% as a sell-off for stocks whipped all the way around the world back to Wall Street. A report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates. It was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September. Now, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through. \u201cThe Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \u201cEconomic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They\u2019ll have to do something bigger than\u201d the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point \u201cto avert a recession.\u201d \n Traders are now betting on a 70% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That\u2019s even though Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is \u201cnot something we\u2019re thinking about right now.\u201d Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it\u2019s walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen.  While refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation fronts on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials \u201chave a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness\u201d in the job market after hiking its main rate so high.  \u201cCertainly today\u2019s job data feeds the weakening economy narrative, but I believe the market is overreacting at this point and pricing too much in on rate cuts at this stage,\u201d said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. \u201cYes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy.\u201d  U.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses Friday before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street. Several big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a mostly dispiriting run that began last week with results from Tesla and Alphabet. Amazon fell 8.8% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The retail and tech giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations. Intel dropped even more, 26.1%, for its worst day in 50 years, after the chip company\u2019s profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts. It also suspended its dividend payment and forecast a loss for the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit. Apple held steadier, up 0.7%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.  Apple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the \u201c Magnificent Seven \u201d were the main reasons the S&P 500 set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence  technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high. Friday\u2019s losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \u201ccorrection.\u201d Helpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates began rebounding sharply last month when tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.5%, more than the rest of the market.  All told, the S&P 500 fell 100.12 points to 5,346.56. The Dow dropped 610.71 to 39.737.26, and the Nasdaq composite fell 417.98 to 16,776.16. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders forecasted deeper cuts to rates coming from the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.79% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April.  In stock markets abroad, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%. It\u2019s been struggling since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and deflate a boom in tourism. Chinese stocks fell as investors registered disappointment with the government\u2019s latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, while stock indexes dropped by more than 1% across much of Europe. Commodity prices also had a rough ride this week. Oil prices leaped after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah fueled fears that a widening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt the flow of crude.  But prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries that a weakening economy would burn less fuel. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude dropped back below $74 Friday after coming into the week above $77.  AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. "

        "body": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump returns Saturday to Georgia, which he lost four years ago, to campaign in a state that both Democrats and Republicans see as up for grabs yet again.  Trump\u2019s 5 p.m. EDT event alongside his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, comes just days after Vice President Kamala Harris rallied thousands in the same basketball arena at Georgia State University in Atlanta.  Both parties are focusing on Georgia, a Sun Belt battleground that just two weeks ago, Democrats had signaled they would sideline in favor of a heavier focus on the Midwestern \u201cblue wall\u201d states. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to end his campaign and endorse Harris fueled Democratic hopes of an expanded electoral map. \u201cThe momentum in this race is shifting,\u201d Harris told a cheering, boisterous crowd on Tuesday. \u201cAnd there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\u201d  Biden beat Trump in the state by 11,779 votes in 2020. Trump pressured Georgia\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to change the outcome. Trump was later indicted in Georgia for his efforts to overturn the election, but the case remains on hold while courts decide whether the Fulton County district attorney can continue to prosecute it.  In announcing Saturday\u2019s rally, the Trump campaign accused Harris of costing Georgians money due to inflation and higher gas prices, which have risen from pandemic-era lows at the end of the Trump administration. The campaign also noted the case of Laken Riley, a nursing student from the state who was killed while jogging in a park on Feb. 22. A Venezuelan citizen has been indicted on murder charges in her death.  \n Trump and his allies have repeatedly labeled Harris the current administration\u2019s \u201cborder czar,\u201d a reference to her assignment leading White House efforts on migration.  But in recent days, Trump has lobbed false attacks about Harris\u2019 race and suggested she misled voters about her identity. Harris has stated for years in public life that she is Black and Indian American.  At her rally in Atlanta, Harris called Trump and Vance \u201cplain weird\u201d \u2014 a lane of messaging seized on by many other Democrats of late \u2014 and taunted Trump for wavering on whether he\u2019d show up for their upcoming debate, currently on the books for Sept. 10 on ABC. Saying earlier that he would debate Harris, Trump has more recently questioned the value of a meetup, calling host network ABC News \u201cfake news,\u201d saying he \u201cprobably\u201d will debate Harris, but he \u201ccan also make a case for not doing it.\u201d What to know about the 2024 Election The fact that both Harris and Trump have been focusing resources on Georgia underscores the state\u2019s renewed significance to both parties come November. Going to Atlanta puts Trump in the state\u2019s largest media market, including suburbs and exurbs that were traditional Republican strongholds but have become more competitive as they\u2019ve diversified and grown in population.  In a strategy memo released after Biden left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon \u2014 who held the same role for Biden \u2014 reaffirmed the importance of winning the traditional Democratic blue wall trio of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania but also argued that Harris\u2019 place atop the ticket \u201copens up additional persuadable voters\u201d and described them as \u201cdisproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\u201d in places like Georgia.  Next week, along with her eventual running mate, Harris plans to visit that Midwestern trifecta, along with North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. On Friday, she will make another stop in Georgia.

        "body": "ORANGE, Va. (AP) \u2014 On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \u201cSaving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\u201d For founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby \u2014 their own.  Paul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.  In the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son\u2019s memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \u201cWe knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\u201d Evelyn James said.  A cross hangs in the prayer room at the Paul Stefan Foundation maternity home in Orange, Virginia, on Friday, January 5, 2024.

The couple started the home after losing the last of their six children. (AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski) In August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia. Their momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a significant increase,\u201d said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court\u2019s ruling. There are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It\u2019s part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers. \n \u201cThis is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\u201d Harkins said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d  There\u2019s been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of them to meet a growing need. But maternity homes have had a traumatic history. (AP Video: Jessie Wardarski) The reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.  \u201cIt created a perfect storm,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a need.\u201d Meryem Bakache, left, a mother at Mary\u2019s Shelter maternity home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Jasmine Heriot, right, a former Mary\u2019s Shelter resident, hold their children on Friday, January 5, 2024.

(AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski) The heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \u201cBaby Scoop Era,\u201d more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies. \u201cOur children were stolen,\u201d said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.

(Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh via AP) Back then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.  But few could forget.  \u201cIt\u2019s a mother losing her child,\u201d said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \u201cThe Girls Who Went Away.\u201d  Fessler, herself an adoptee, said, \u201cThe women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\u201d  Harkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It\u2019s often discussed among members and at conferences.  \u201cIt is very dear to our hearts,\u201d Harkins said. \u201cWe are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don\u2019t get to that point again.\u201d  The number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.  Kathleen Wilson, founder of the maternity home organization Mary\u2019s Shelter, sits for a portrait at one of the homes in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on Friday, January 5, 2024.

(AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski) As the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.  There are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies \u2014 which can still result in painful outcomes.  Abbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.  Homeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \u201cthe most cardinal sin,\u201d but she still desperately wanted to parent her son. \u201cBut everyone told me this isn\u2019t playing house. He\u2019s not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\u201d she said. The home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \u201cand has the freedom to choose.\u201d In the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \u201c voicelessbirthmother,\u201d hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him. \u201cHalf my head resides in that maternity home,\u201d she said, \u201cplaying the memories again and again and again.\u201d Before she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.  Newly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.  \u201cWhere can I live with this baby?\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cWhat can I give him? I don\u2019t have nothing.\u201d  Without health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center \u2014 often called a crisis pregnancy center \u2014 which provided her with an ultrasound.  \u201cWhen I see my baby, just like everything changed,\u201d she said.  The center\u2019s staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary\u2019s Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.  Many maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary\u2019s Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.  It\u2019s one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement \u2014 and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.  \u201cI\u2019m in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don\u2019t think it should be contingent on somebody\u2019s decision to give birth or not,\u201d said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.  Jasmine Heriot, right, a former Mary\u2019s Shelter resident, talks to the child of Meryem Bakache, a mother at Mary\u2019s Shelter maternity home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on Friday, January 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski) Holding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary\u2019s Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.  Her housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.  \u201cEverything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\u201d Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her. In the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary\u2019s Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.  Across the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations. Mary\u2019s Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.  They welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \u201chealthy living,\u201d though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.  She is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.  Wilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \u201cThey defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\u201d  At Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.

(AP Photo/Jessie Wardarski) Downstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader. But she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \u201cYou don\u2019t end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\u201d she said. Evelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \u201cWomen are not numbers here. Or case files,\u201d she said.  She found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.  \u201cLiving with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cLike I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\u201d  It inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.  Her time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it\u2019s foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.  \u201cMy heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\u201d she said later.  She didn\u2019t choose an abortion, and still wouldn\u2019t. But she doesn\u2019t judge those who do.  Abortion is \u201cone of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s grace for those women too.\u201d Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 New blood tests could help doctors diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease faster and more accurately, researchers reported Sunday \u2013 but some appear to work far better than others. It\u2019s tricky to tell if memory problems are caused by Alzheimer\u2019s. That requires confirming one of the disease\u2019s hallmark signs \u2014 buildup of a sticky protein called beta-amyloid \u2014 with a hard-to-get brain scan or uncomfortable spinal tap. Many patients instead are diagnosed based on symptoms and cognitive exams. Labs have begun offering a variety of tests that can detect certain signs of Alzheimer\u2019s in blood. Scientists are excited by their potential but the tests aren\u2019t widely used yet because there\u2019s little data to guide doctors about which kind to order and when. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t formally approved any of them and there\u2019s little insurance coverage. \u201cWhat tests can we trust?\u201d asked Dr. Suzanne Schindler, a neurologist at Washington University in St. Louis who\u2019s part of a research project examining that. While some are very accurate, \u201cother tests are not much better than a flip of a coin.\u201d More than 6 million people in the United States and millions more around the world have Alzheimer\u2019s, the most common form of dementia. Its telltale \u201cbiomarkers\u201d are brain-clogging amyloid plaques and abnormal tau protein that leads to neuron-killing tangles. This article is part of AP\u2019s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. New drugs, Leqembi and Kisunla, can modestly slow worsening symptoms by removing gunky amyloid from the brain. But they only work in the earliest stages of Alzheimer\u2019s and proving patients qualify in time can be difficult. Measuring amyloid in spinal fluid is invasive. A special PET scan to spot plaques is costly and getting an appointment can take months.  \n Even specialists can struggle to tell if Alzheimer\u2019s or something else is to blame for a patient\u2019s symptoms. \u201cI have patients not infrequently who I am convinced have Alzheimer\u2019s disease and I do testing and it\u2019s negative,\u201d Schindler said. Blood tests so far have been used mostly in carefully controlled research settings. But a new study of about 1,200 patients in Sweden shows they also can work in the real-world bustle of doctors\u2019 offices \u2014 especially primary care doctors who see far more people with memory problems than specialists but have fewer tools to evaluate them. In the study, patients who visited either a primary care doctor or a specialist for memory complaints got an initial diagnosis using traditional exams, gave blood for testing and were sent for a confirmatory spinal tap or brain scan. Blood testing was far more accurate, Lund University researchers reported Sunday at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in Philadelphia. The primary care doctors\u2019 initial diagnosis was 61% accurate and the specialists\u2019 73% \u2014 but the blood test was 91% accurate, according to the findings, which also were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. There\u2019s almost \u201ca wild West\u201d in the variety being offered, said Dr. John Hsiao of the National Institute on Aging. They measure different biomarkers, in different ways. Doctors and researchers should only use blood tests proven to have a greater than 90% accuracy rate, said Alzheimer\u2019s Association chief science officer Maria Carrillo. Today\u2019s tests most likely to meet that benchmark measure what\u2019s called p-tau217, Carrillo and Hsiao agreed. Schindler helped lead an unusual direct comparison of several kinds of blood tests, funded by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, that came to the same conclusion. That type of test measures a form of tau that correlates with how much plaque buildup someone has, Schindler explained. A high level signals a strong likelihood the person has Alzheimer\u2019s while a low level indicates that\u2019s probably not the cause of memory loss. Several companies are developing p-tau217 tests including ALZpath Inc., Roche, Eli Lilly and C2N Diagnostics, which supplied the version used in the Swedish study. Only doctors can order them from labs. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association is working on guidelines and several companies plan to seek FDA approval, which would clarify proper use. For now, Carrillo said doctors should use blood testing only in people with memory problems, after checking the accuracy of the type they order.  Especially for primary care physicians, \u201cit really has great potential to help them in sorting out who to give a reassuring message and who to send on to memory specialists,\u201d said Dr. Sebastian Palmqvist of Lund University, who led the Swedish study with Lund\u2019s Dr. Oskar Hansson. The tests aren\u2019t yet for people who don\u2019t have symptoms but worry about Alzheimer\u2019s in the family \u2014 unless it\u2019s part of enrollment in research studies, Schindler stressed.  That\u2019s partly because amyloid buildup can begin two decades before the first sign of memory problems, and so far there are no preventive steps other than basic advice to eat healthy, exercise and get enough sleep. But there are studies underway testing possible therapies for people at high risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, and some include blood testing.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The United States and Russia completed their biggest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history on Thursday, with Moscow releasing journalist Evan Gershkovich and fellow American Paul Whelan, along with dissidents including Vladimir Kara-Murza, in a multinational deal that set two dozen people free. Gershkovich, Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva, a journalist with dual U.S.-Russia citizenship, arrived on American soil shortly before midnight for a joyful reunion with their families. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris also were at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to greet them and dispense hugs all around.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) The trade unfolded despite relations between Washington and Moscow being at their lowest point since the Cold War after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.  Negotiators in backchannel talks at one point explored an exchange involving Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but after his death in February ultimately stitched together a 24-person deal that required significant concessions from European allies, including the release of a Russian assassin, and secured freedom for a cluster of journalists, suspected spies, political prisoners and others. Biden trumpeted the exchange, by far the largest in a series of swaps with Russia, as a diplomatic feat while welcoming families of the returning Americans to the White House. But the deal, like others before it, reflected an innate imbalance: The U.S. and allies gave up Russians charged or convicted of serious crimes in exchange for Russia releasing journalists, dissidents and others imprisoned by the country\u2019s highly politicized legal system on charges seen by the West as trumped-up. \u201cDeals like this one come with tough calls,\u201d Biden said. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that matters more to me than protecting Americans at home and abroad.\u201d \n Under the deal, Russia released Gershkovich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal who was jailed in 2023 and convicted in July of espionage charges that he and the U.S. government vehemently denied. His family said in a statement released by the newspaper that \u201cwe can\u2019t wait to give him the biggest hug and see his sweet and brave smile up close.\u201d The paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, called it a \u201cjoyous day.\u201d \u201cWhile we waited for this momentous day, we were determined to be as loud as we could be on Evan\u2019s behalf. We are so grateful for all the voices that were raised when his was silent. We can finally say, in unison, \u2018Welcome home, Evan,\u2019\u201d she wrote in a letter posted online.

(Vaughn Sterling/The Wall Street Journal via AP) Also released was Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive jailed since 2018, also on espionage charges he and Washington have denied, and Kurmasheva, a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist convicted in July of spreading false information about the Russian military, accusations her family and employer have rejected. The three flew from Maryland to Texas and landed at Joint Base San Antonio early Friday to begin medical evaluations after spending some time with their family members. If they choose, they can receive treatment the military offers to wrongfully detained Americans. The dissidents released included Kara-Murza, a Kremlin critic and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer serving 25 years on charges of treason widely seen as politically motivated, as well as multiple associates of Navalny. Freed Kremlin critics included Oleg Orlov, a veteran human rights campaigner convicted of discrediting the Russian military, and Ilya Yashin, imprisoned for criticizing the war in Ukraine.  The Russian side got Vadim Krasikov, who was convicted in Germany in 2021 and sentenced to life in prison for killing a former Chechen rebel in a Berlin park two years earlier, apparently on the orders of Moscow\u2019s security services. Throughout the negotiations, Moscow had been persistent in pressing for his release, with Putin himself raising it.

But with that prospect erased, senior U.S. officials, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, made a fresh push to encourage Germany to release Krasikov. In the end, a handful of the prisoners Russia released were either German nationals or dual German-Russian nationals. Russia also received two alleged sleeper agents jailed in Slovenia, as well as three men charged by federal authorities in the U.S., including Roman Seleznev, a convicted computer hacker and the son of a Russian lawmaker, and Vadim Konoshchenok, a suspected Russian intelligence operative accused of providing American-made electronics and ammunition to the Russian military. Norway returned an academic arrested on suspicions of being a Russian spy; Poland sent back a man it detained on espionage charges. \u201cToday is a powerful example of why it\u2019s vital to have friends in this world,\u201d Biden said. All told, six countries released at least one prisoner and a seventh, Turkey, participated by hosting the location for the swap, in Ankara.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Biden placed securing the release of Americans held wrongfully overseas at the top of his foreign policy agenda for the six months before he leaves office. In an Oval Office address discussing his decision to drop his bid for a second term, Biden said, \u201cWe\u2019re also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world.\u201d  At one point Thursday, he grabbed the hand of Whelan\u2019s sister, Elizabeth, and said she had practically been living at the White House as the administration tried to free Paul. He then motioned for Kurmasheva\u2019s daughter, Miriam, to come closer and took her hand, telling the room it was her 13th birthday. He asked everyone to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d with him. She wiped tears from her eyes. The Biden administration has now brought home more than 70 Americans detained in other countries as part of deals that have required the U.S. to give up a broad array of convicted criminals, including for drug and weapons offenses. The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivize future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. government\u2019s top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, has sought to defend the deals by saying the number of wrongfully detained Americans has actually gone down even as swaps have increased. Tucker, the Journal\u2019s editor-in-chief, acknowledged the debate, writing, \u201cWe know the U.S. government is keenly aware, as are we, that the only way to prevent a quickening cycle of arresting innocent people as pawns in cynical geopolitical games is to remove the incentive for Russia and other nations that pursue the same detestable practice.\u201d Though she called for a change to the dynamic, \u201cfor now,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe are celebrating the return of Evan.\u201d Thursday\u2019s swap of 24 prisoners surpassed a deal involving 14 people that was struck in 2010. In that exchange, Washington freed 10 Russians living in the U.S. as sleepers, while Moscow deported four Russians, including Sergei Skripal, a double agent working with British intelligence. He and his daughter in 2018 were nearly killed in Britain by nerve agent poisoning blamed on Russian agents. This photo combination shows, clockwise from top left: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, corporate security executive Paul Whelan, former head of Open Russia movement Andrei Pivovarov, Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, Prague-based editor for the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u2019s Tatar-Bashkir service Alsu Kurmasheva, and Lilia Chanysheva, former coordinator of regional offices of the late opposition figure Alexei Navalny. (AP Photo) Speculation had mounted for weeks that a swap was near because of a confluence of unusual developments, including a startlingly quick trial for Gershkovich, which Washington regarded as a sham. He was sentenced to 16 years in a maximum-security prison. In a trial that concluded in two days in secrecy in the same week as Gershkovich\u2019s, Kurmasheva was convicted on charges of spreading false information about the Russian military that her family, employer and U.S. officials rejected. Also in recent days, several other figures imprisoned in Russia for speaking out against the war in Ukraine or over their work with Navalny were moved from prison to unknown locations. Gershkovich was arrested March 29, 2023, while on a reporting trip to the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Authorities claimed, without offering any evidence, that he was gathering secret information for the U.S. The son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, he moved to Russia in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022. Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained, as was Whelan, who was detained in December 2018 after traveling to Russia for a wedding.  Whelan, who was serving a 16-year prison sentence, had been excluded from prior high-profile deals involving Russia, including the April 2022 swap by Moscow of imprisoned Marine veteran Trevor Reed for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot convicted in a drug trafficking conspiracy. That December, the U.S. released notorious arms trafficker Viktor Bout in exchange for WNBA star Brittney Griner, who had been jailed on drug charges. \u201cPaul Whelan is free. Our family is grateful to the United States government for making Paul\u2019s freedom a reality,\u201d his family said in a statement. On a warm and steamy night, the freed Americans lingered on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, soaking up the moment of their return to the U.S. They took selfies with family members and friends, shared hugs with Biden and Harris, and patted loved ones on the back and smothered them with kisses.  At one point, Biden gave Whelan the flag pin off his own lapel. Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia, and Lee from Mongolia. Associated Press writers Jonathan J. Cooper at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, and Zeke Miller and Colleen Long contributed to this report."

        "body": "Etsy said Wednesday it will begin testing its first-ever loyalty program in September, a move designed to boost the e-commerce site\u2019s sluggish sales and draw in occasional shoppers. The New York-based company said select buyers will receive an invitation for the program, which will offer free shipping across the U.S. and access to discounts.  \u201cWe want people to start their shopping journey on Etsy rather than come to Etsy when they\u2019re just looking for something very specific,\u201d Raina Moskowitz, the company\u2019s chief operating and marketing officer, said in an interview.  Etsy is launching the program \u2014 called Etsy Insider \u2014 with the aim of reversing a decline in its gross merchandise sales, a measure of the amount of goods sold over a certain period.  Etsy did not disclose how much customers must pay for the new loyalty program. But Moskowitz said the monthly fee will be close to the cost of a latte. She also said the company will decide on whether or not to do a nationwide rollout of the program after seeing what resonates with consumers.  The company with roots as an online crafts marketplace experienced a boom in its business during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers turned to it for items such as artistic face masks. But it\u2019s been facing more challenges since the worst of the pandemic eased and consumers, who typically go on its site to buy discretionary items, began to feel more pressure from inflation. Like Amazon, it is also facing more competition from Temu, the online retailer owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings.  During the first three months of this year, Etsy reported merchandise sales on its marketplace were down 5.3% compared to the same period last year. Consolidated sales, which include purchases made by consumers on two other online sites it owns, had declined by 3.7%, following a slight dip last year.  \n The company\u2019s stock price has lost nearly 78% of its value since late 2021. In December, it said it would lay off 225 employees, which represented nearly 11% of its workforce.  Though Etsy\u2019s business has softened due the wider economic environment and the loss of pandemic-era sales, some of the challenges can also be tied to the fact that the platform has become more challenging for shoppers to navigate, said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail.  Saunders said he calls the evolution the \u201cjunkification\u201d of Etsy.  \u201cEtsy used to be a very focused site that really was about makers, crafting, authentic and unique products,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s still true to some extent, but there\u2019s a lot more junk on the site and a lot of random things being sold.\u201d Furthermore, Saunders said Etsy\u2019s search functions have gotten worse, which has the potential to turn customers off.  More recently, the company has put more focus on returning to its artisan roots as it seeks to differentiate itself in a competitive e-commerce landscape. "

        "body": "In our spoiler phobic culture, movie trailers don\u2019t often offer a lot of information. It\u2019s even dangerous territory for a critic to discuss too many specifics, sometimes years after a film or television show has come out.  So it seemed like a particularly bold and even confusing move for \u201c Trap,\u201d the latest film from M. Night Shyamalan, to reveal so much so soon. Namely, that the nice guy dad played by nice guy actor Josh Hartnett taking his teenage daughter to a Taylor Swift-like arena concert is a brutal serial killer. Not only that, the entire event has been manufactured by to trap him. Doesn\u2019t seem like something that a filmmaker known, or at least stereotyped, for his twists would do. Obviously there must be something else going on, right? Perhaps that something else is that \u201cTrap\u201d really doesn\u2019t take itself that seriously. It is a solidly entertaining film that\u2019s mostly silly and sometimes unnerving. You\u2019re not exactly rooting for Hartnett\u2019s Cooper, whose energy is so manically enthusiastic in his casual interactions with strangers and acquaintances that it takes some getting used to. But you are drawn in enough to be ever curious about his next move. Hartnett, fresh off a stately turn in \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d is not going for naturalistic with this performance. He\u2019s a psychopath trying, not very well, to keep his devilish side at bay. When he smiles and attempts pleasantries, it looks almost painful. His energy is intense and a little uncomfortable. If Hartnett was born just a little earlier, you could image him as part of the original \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d cast \u2014 even his name seems to be a nod. And here, Cooper\u2019s supervillain power is being able to seamlessly pass as the normal suburban dad just trying to show his daughter (Ariel Donoghue) a fun time. That is soon dashed when a friendly arena employee decides to clue him in on the big plot to catch The Butcher. One thing \u201cTrap\u201d does especially well is exploit the ways in which a guy like Cooper \u2014 attractive, confident, white \u2014 can pass almost anywhere. Much of the film transpires at an arena concert full of teen and tween girls obsessed with a pop star called Lady Raven, played by Shyamalan\u2019s daughter, Saleka Shyamalan, who wrote 14 songs for the film. It\u2019s quite the hard launch for an up-and-coming performer, but it\u2019s an admirably bold one too. \u201cEveryone needs a break when they\u2019re starting out,\u201d she says to the crowd at one point. \u201cTrap\u201d commits to the bit, too, making you feel like you are on the ground floor experiencing a concert in real time. But if you went in hoping for \u201cDie Hard\u201d in an arena, be prepared for something else. \n \u201cTrap\u201d does have some things up its sleeve, including a solid and unexpected acting performance from Saleka Shyamalan. It also feels a bit underbaked, a ridiculous ride that\u2019s not going to get under your skin or provide for a lot of discussion fodder afterwards. While it\u2019s great to see Hayley Mills, regal as ever, as the mastermind of the police operation, she\u2019s not given much to do besides narrate. But maybe there\u2019s not meant to be some grand there there, like some startling revelation about parenthood or marriage or pop stardom or even sociopaths. We keep wanting Shyamalan to somehow give us \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d or \u201cSigns\u201d again. \u201cTrap\u201d is not either of those. This is a popcorn movie, with a surprising turn from an underrated star. And ultimately, it\u2019s a pretty fun time at the theater. \u201cTrap,\u201d a Warner Bros. release now in theaters, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cbrief strong language, some violent content.\u201d Running time: 105 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

(AP) \u2014 This southern Mississippi town\u2019s expansive wood pellet plant was so close to Shelia Mae Dobbins\u2019 home that she sometimes heard company loudspeakers. She says industrial residues coated her truck and she no longer enjoys spending time in the air outdoors.  Dobbins feels her life \u2014 and health \u2014 were better before 2016, when United Kingdom energy giant Drax opened a facility able to compress 450,000 tons of wood chips annually in the majority Black town of Gloster, Mississippi. To her, it\u2019s no coincidence federal regulators find residents are exposed to unwanted air particles and they experience asthma more than most of the country. Her asthma and diabetes were once under control, but since a 2017 diagnosis of heart and lung disease, Dobbins has frequently lived at the end of a breathing tube connected to an oxygen cannister. \u201cSomething is going on. And it\u2019s all around the plant,\u201d said the 59-year-old widow who raised two children here. \u201cNobody asked us could they bring that plant there.\u201d Shelia Mae Dobbins holds part of her oxygen tube inside her home in Gloster, Miss., Wednesday, May 29, 2024.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Wood pellet production skyrocketed across the U.S. South. It helped feed demand in the European Union for renewable energy, as those coutries sought to replace fossil fuels such as coal. But many residents near plants -- often African Americans in poor, rural swaths -- find the process left their air dustier and people sicker. Billions of dollars are available for these projects under President Joe Biden\u2019s signature law combating climate change. The administration is weighing whether to open up tax credits for companies to burn wood pellets for energy.  Shelia Mae Dobbins cries as she talks about her health inside her home in Gloster, Miss., Wednesday, May 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) \n As producers expand west, environmentalists want the government to stop incentivizing what they call a misguided attempt to curb carbon emissions that pollute communities of color while presently warming the atmosphere.  Despite hefty pollution fines against industry players and one major producer\u2019s recent bankruptcy, supporters say the multibillion-dollar market is experiencing growing pains. In wood pellets, they see an innovative long-term solution to the climate crisis that brings revenue necessary for forest owners to maintain plantations. Birds fly past a pile of wood used to make pellets during a tour of a Drax facility in Gloster, Miss., Monday, May 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) After the European Union classified biomass as renewable energy in 2009, the Southeast\u2019s annual wood pellet capacity increased from about 300,000 tons to more than 7.3 million tons by 2017, according to research led by a University of Missouri team. Federal energy statistics show about three dozen southern wood pellet manufacturing facilities account for nearly 80% of annual U.S. capacity. Most pellets are used for commercial-scale energy overseas.  The market brought hope for revitalization to small, disadvantaged communities. But interviews with residents of towns with large Black populations, from Gaston, North Carolina, to Uniontown, Alabama, surfaced complaints of truck traffic, air pollution and noise from pellet plants.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Dan Caston, an employee of Drax, shows some of the wood pellets their plant produces in Gloster, Miss., Monday, May 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Gloster has become the poster child for such tensions. In 2020, Mississippi\u2019s environmental agency fined Drax $2.5 million for violating air emissions limits. Gloster is exposed to more particulate matter than much of the U.S. and adults have higher asthma rates than 80% of the country, according to an Environmental Protection Agency mapping tool. Median household income is about $22,000; the poverty rate is triple the national level. Spokesperson Michelli Martin said Drax in 2021 installed pollution controls, including incinerators to decrease carbon emissions. An environmental consulting firm found \u201cno adverse effects to human health\u201d and that \u201cno modeled pollutant from the facility exceeded\u201d acceptable levels, Martin said. The company recently committed to annual town halls and announced a $250,000 Gloster Community Fund to \u201cimprove quality of life.\u201d But critics aren\u2019t swayed by showings of corporate goodwill they say don\u2019t account for poor air.

A man crosses the street in downtown Gloster, Miss., Thursday, May 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Environmentalists are calling on Biden to stop aiding an industry they believe runs counter to his green energy goals. At the annual United Nations climate conference, The Dogwood Alliance urged attendees to phase out wood pellets.  Enviva \u2014 the world\u2019s largest wood pellet producer \u2014 had already received subsidies through the 2018 farm bill signed by former President Donald Trump, according to Sheila Korth, a former policy analyst with nonpartisan watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense.  But Korth said the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act made tax credits available to companies that create pellets for countries in Europe and Asia.  Elizabeth Woodworth, interim executive director of the US Industrial Pellet Association, said the money is a small part of lRA allocations and noted emerging technologies require government subsidies. The industry argues that replanting of trees will eventually absorb carbon produced by burning pellets.  \u201cWe need every single technology we can get our hands on to mitigate climate change,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cBioenergy is a part of that.\u201d Scientific studies have found firing wood pellets puts more carbon immediately into the atmosphere than coal. Pollution from biomass-based facilities is nearly three times higher than that of other energy sectors, according to a 2023 paper in the journal Renewable Energy. In a 2018 letter, hundreds of scientists warned the EU that the \u201cadditional carbon load\u201d from burning wood pellets means \u201cpermanent damages\u201d including glacial melting.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Drax \u2014 with plants operating in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2014 is heading west. The corporation signed an agreement in February with Golden State Natural Resources to identify biomass from California\u2019s forests. The public-private venture hopes to build two plants by year\u2019s end and produce up to 1 million tons of wood pellets annually. Another Drax project in Washington would produce 500,000 tons a year. The Natural Resources Defense Council\u2019s Rita Frost, who fought plants in the South, said the deal will endanger California\u2019s low-income Latino communities much like she says the industry threatened Black southern towns. \u201cIt\u2019s an environmental justice problem that should not be repeated in California,\u201d Frost said.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Biomass, including wood pellets, accounted for less than 5% of U.S. primary energy consumption in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a key federal decision could draw more companies into pellet combustion \u2014 not just production.  The White House is looking into whether biomass facilities should receive tax credits meant for zero-emission electricity generators. The Treasury Department is weighing whether biomass\u2019 potential long-term carbon neutrality is sufficient even if its production increases emissions in the short term. Spokesperson Michael Martinez said they are \u201ccarefully considering public comments\u201d and \u201cworking to issue final rules that will increase energy security and clean energy supply as effectively as possible.\u201d Some environmentalists doubt the energy alternative is ultimately carbon neutral. The Southern Environmental Law Center fears the credits could be the incentive needed for the U.S. to join Europe in scaling up the burning of pellets. \u201cThe threat here is really the growth of biomass energy production in the U.S. itself,\u201d said senior attorney Heather Hillaker. \u201cWhich obviously will add to the total carbon and climate harms of this industry globally.\u201d Pollard reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

The beam underneath her feet. The sounds and smell of a packed gym. The intoxicating mix of frustration, determination and joy while trying to master a new skill. Only, as her 20s turned into her 30s, the director of investment operations at a firm in Raleigh, North Carolina, felt she had nowhere to go to turn those pangs into something tangible. \u201cI never thought I would do gymnastics again,\u201d Castellano said. Then, in the summer of 2021, she watched Simone Biles (23 at the time) and 33-year-old mother of two Chellsie Memmel compete at the U.S. championships. Castellano soon found herself on a website ordering a couple of leotards. Not long after the Tokyo Olympics, inspired by what she\u2019d watched, Castellano summoned the courage to visit Triumph Gymnastics in Cary, North Carolina, the rare gym that offered adult classes. She quickly discovered those familiar pangs were not unique to her. The demographics surrounding the sport are shifting, and not just at the elite level, where Biles and the oldest women\u2019s team the U.S. has ever sent to the Olympics \u2014 the aptly nicknamed \u201c Golden Girls \u201d \u2014 returned to the top of the podium in the team final on Tuesday night.

Her stiffest competition figures to come from 25-year-old Brazilian Rebeca Andrade in an event that also includes Ellie Black of Canada and Filipa Martins of Portugal, both 28. \n Their longevity is reflective of a global movement of a sport long considered the realm of the very young. Not so much anymore, as doors long thought shut have swung back open. Participation in adult gymnastics \u2014 from former competitors like Castellano who returned after a long hiatus to novices trying to get the hang of a forward roll \u2014 is soaring. Paris Olympics The National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs serves as a landing spot for gymnasts over 18 at the non-elite, non-NCAA level. While the majority of its membership consists of college students who compete as part of a club, it also offers a \u201cnon-student\u201d division, meaning anyone at any age can compete at one of its meets, including its national championships. NAIGC executive director Ilana Shushansky estimates that 20% of the participants at nationals earlier this year in Albuquerque, New Mexico, registered as \u201cnon-students.\u201d It\u2019s a percentage Shushansky believes will continue to rise, fueled in part by former gymnasts rediscovering \u2014 and in many cases redefining \u2014 their relationship with the sport that drew them in as kids only to seemingly abandon them as young adults. \u201cThis is allowing them to meet the sport on their terms,\u201d Shushansky said. That\u2019s the way it is for many of those who have made their way to one of the adult camps hosted by Memmel, who retired for good in 2021 and now serves as the co-lead for the USA Gymnastics women\u2019s national team when she\u2019s not running the gym she and her father, Andy, run in Wisconsin. Memmel wasn\u2019t trying to prove a point when she came out of retirement in 2021. She did anyway. Messages of support poured into her social media accounts as other 30 and 40-somethings latched onto her journey. The comments often included a common refrain, some version of \u201chey, we want to get back into gymnastics, too, but how do we do it?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s that unfinished business,\u201d said 44-year-old Angela Fuller, who like Castellano quit in her teens only to feel the itch to return while watching Memmel in 2021 and now competes at 5280 Gymnastics outside Denver. \u201cIt\u2019s that dangling carrot. We needed someone to lead the way and show us that it\u2019s possible and that\u2019s what Chellsie Memmel did for gymnastics.\u201d In the summer of 2022, Memmel opened registration for an adults-only camp. She hoped 40 people would sign up. Within hours she had to cap enrollment at 75 out of fear she couldn\u2019t find enough coaches to handle the workload. Now several times a year athletes from their 20s to their 50s with various levels of experience \u2014 and in the case of some, none at all \u2014 spend a weekend at a camp led by an Olympic medalist who has become a touchstone for a movement. While Memmel sees it as a way of giving back, selfishly there\u2019s something in it for her, too. The vibe in the camps are a stark contrast to the culture at the elite level she grew up in, in the best way possible. \u201cThis fills up my cup so much,\u201d said Memmel, whose most recent camp in June had 90 participants. \u201cTheir energy, enthusiasm, love for the sport. When we have new coaches come in, they\u2019re just like in awe of the gymnasts, the camaraderie and all of the support they give each other.\u201d Gina Paulhus\u2019 expectations were low when she began running a website and created the Facebook group \u201c Aging Like Fine Wine \u201d centered on giving adult gymnasts a place where they could connect to the sport and each other. The group now boasts more than 13,000 members. The website \u2014 which has the phrase \u201cthis sport is not just for kids anymore!\u201d in all caps on the front page \u2014 offers training videos, forums and ways for interested athletes to find classes or a team. Paulhus also runs an adults-only camp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Back in 2015, she believed hers was the only camp of its kind. Now there are more than 30, not to mention hundreds of meets across the country every year that are open to athletes over 18. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of those cases where \u2018monkey see, monkey do\u2019 and now it\u2019s sort of reached this critical mass,\u201d she said. Things are evolving so rapidly that it\u2019s becoming apparent that supply is struggling to keep up with demand. Memmel says the feedback she hears most often at camps comes from those who essentially coach themselves back at their home gyms because there is no one to fill the void. One of the biggest issues is insurance. Policies to cover adult classes are substantially more expensive than ones that cover children because of the risk of injury, leading some gym owners to shy away from the opportunity. That didn\u2019t stop Debra Bell when she and her husband opened Triumph Gymnastics, where Castellano trains. One of their main tenets was creating a space where adults could come because, as the former competitive gymnast pointed out, \u201cfor some of us, it never leaves you.\u201d It never did for Castellano, who briefly got into coaching during college before immersing herself in the corporate world. She believes she is better now at 34 than she was as a teenager, even if her training looks far different than it did two decades ago. She\u2019s at the gym for an hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays and two hours on Sundays. It\u2019s not just her schedule that\u2019s changed. Her mindset has, too. \u201cWhen I got back into it, I didn\u2019t take it for granted at all because I knew what it was like to not have gymnastics in my life,\u201d she said. It\u2019s a common refrain among her peers. They\u2019re not doing this because their parents signed them up. Most of them have families and careers. Their relationship with the sport has evolved from something they are to something they do, a critical shift. Fuller spent decades bothered by both an ankle injury from the balance beam and the constant sense she needed to excel to earn validation from her parents. It\u2019s not that way anymore. She is part of an adult team at 5280 that boasts more than 40 members. She travels all over the world competing, sometimes in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s events. Occasionally she\u2019ll receive notes of encouragement from young girls who see the mother of two teenage sons do her thing and realize their love of doing gymnastics doesn\u2019t need an expiration date. \u201cThey tell me \u2018I can do this at your age,\u2019\u201d Fuller said. \u201c\u2018I can do this forever.\u2019 ... And that\u2019s great. Because I\u2019m never leaving.\u201d AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"

        "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Outside the home clubhouse, a teen with close-cropped, bleached-white hair waited for Bryce Harper. The kid was in a Philadelphia Phillies jersey, flap open, a gold chain against his bare chest. Most kids Cavan Sullivan\u2019s age would grow bug-eyed or feel some jitters meeting the Phillies slugger. Most kids Cavan Sullivan\u2019s age would plead for a selfie. Cavan Sullivan is not most kids. Never has been, not since he was ordained as soccer\u2019s next big thing before he could buy a ticket for a PG-13 movie. At 14 years, 293 days old, Sullivan became the youngest player to appear in a game for any major professional sports league when he made his July debut for the Philadelphia Union. The teen soccer phenom caught the attention of a former teen prodigy who knows more about baseball but also a thing or two about soccer. Harper is a bit of a soccer nut. His wife played in college. He sent fans into a frenzy when he celebrated a home run in MLB\u2019s London Series with a soccer-style slide, then roared in the dugout, \u201cI love soccer!\u201d Harper has handled the unwieldy expectations that came with being a Sports Illustrated cover boy at 16. It\u2019s the kind of career blueprint Sullivan would love to follow, the prospect who spins potential into greatness rather than slips into a whatever-happened-to trivia answer. \u201cYour skills are incredible, bro. Incredible,\u201d Harper told him that day. \n \u201cYou\u2019ve seen a few clips?\u201d Sullivan said. Yeah, Harper\u2019s seen a few. After Sullivan gifted Harper a Union jersey with the Phillies first baseman\u2019s name on the back, the midfielder sounded more like a sage World Cup veteran than a high schooler who needs to hitch rides to practice. \u201cAs you know, lot of work to do still,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThe hype doesn\u2019t really mean anything.\u201d The hype is real in Philly, mushrooming by the day in MLS and could go global by the time he is expected to transfer to English Premier League powerhouse Manchester City when he is 18. It\u2019s the kind of start Sullivan has dreamed of his entire life. All 14 years. \u201cI\u2019d say I realized I could be a pro at 10 or 11,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cI think that\u2019s when I posted my first highlight reel. ... People said stuff that I didn\u2019t imagine, thinking that I could be where I am today. It came out true.\u201d Sullivan was younger than any player who has appeared in the NBA, NHL, NFL, WNBA or Major League Baseball since at least 1970, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, though 14-year-old McKenna Whitham made her NWSL debut this past week with Gotham at 10 months younger than Sullivan. The Sullivans are a soccer family. He is the second child of collegiate soccer players at Penn, Brendan and Heike Sullivan. Oldest brother Quinn already plays for the Union, and younger brothers Ronan and Declan are in the team\u2019s pipeline. Union coach Jim Curtin played soccer at Villanova under Sullivan\u2019s grandfather, Larry. Brendan Sullivan coached under his father at Villanova, all the familiar ties needed to ease the family\u2019s comfort level with turning Cavan pro so young. His earliest soccer memory, \u201cshirtless in diapers kicking stuff at (stuffed) animals\u201d was enough to send Sullivan on the road from his Norristown, Pennsylvania, home to a future in Europe. His mother recalled the overwhelming feeling when fans recognized Sullivan at the Union stadium and started asking for autographs. That was before he made history; he has since popped up around the area, pushing fast-food chicken for a promotional campaign. He\u2019s been filmed for a documentary and was mobbed on a day off with his family by autograph seekers at the shore. He threw out the first pitch at that Phillies game. \u201cBetter throw a strike or they\u2019ll boo you,\u201d manager Rob Thomson warned Sullivan in his office. Sure enough, Sullivan uncorked a wild one, way high. The Philly crowd went easy. \u201cI aimed high,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt just kept going.\u201d More than a pro soccer career has been accelerated for Sullivan. He should be starting his freshman year of high school but is, instead, headed into his junior year at the YSC Academy, a soccer-specific high school where his dad is a humanities instructor. \u201cI feel like, if I work now, I can have fun later,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m having fun. I\u2019m working every day. That\u2019s the beauty of it.\u201d So this is the part of Sullivan\u2019s story where mom and dad and kid and coach say, sure, he could be a future Messi but he\u2019s just like any other kid his age. He sleeps late and goofs around and Snapchats girls and plays videogames and .. no. None of that. Sullivan\u2019s fun: soccer. His home life: soccer. His hobbies: soccer, soccer and soccer. He laughed and said no when asked if he played FIFA, at least not regularly. Sullivan still lives at home where soccer reigns over a social life, where mom says: \u201cProdigy was not a word used in our house.\u201d \u201cDo all of my kids sort of miss out on some of those normal childhood things? Yes,\u201d Heike says. \u201cIs Cavan\u2019s probably exacerbated by his situation? Absolutely. ... Yes, he is missing out on fun childhood things, and we\u2019ve had conversations about that. He does not seem to be bothered by that.\u201d One reason, among many that include instant fame, endorsements, nearly 72,000 TikTok followers and 245,000 Instagram followers, is a reported $500,000 salary. The Union negotiated a $5 million transfer deal with Man City, winner of Premier League titles from 2021 to 2024. The collaborative transfer agreement makes Sullivan\u2019s deal unusual. It signals that the Premier League club trusts that the Union can develop an elite player. Sullivan can\u2019t play for Manchester City until he is 18. But he holds a German passport that could allow him to move to Europe and play for City-affiliated teams \u2014 like Girona in Spain or Palermo in Italy \u2014 when he turns 16. \u201cMan City doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Sullivan says, \u201cif I don\u2019t do anything here.\u201d Heike Sullivan says 99% of Cavan\u2019s money is invested, with the rest in a checking account. He gets financial guidance from his mother, a top Philadelphia attorney, and they read together every detail in a contract. His family, the Union and Man City have lined up the tools Sullivan needs to thrive and reach the heights projected for him. But for every Harper, every LeBron James, every Sidney Crosby, there are far more can\u2019t-miss teen sensations who missed. Freddy Adu, a pro at just 14, was christened the next Pele but bounced around without leaving much of a legacy. \u201cThat is a data point that\u2019s important to learn from,\u201d Heike said. \u201cBut I think his situation is different. He still has to go to school, that\u2019s something we\u2019re on top of him about. Recognizing that this is an entirely new situation for us, I think we are smart enough, educated enough, well-guided enough, by his agent, things like that, to keep him on the right path.\u201d Even with elite athletes such as Harper wanting to meet him, Sullivan has remained humble in his new life as a sports attraction. \u201cFame doesn\u2019t really mean much to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the soccer side of things and what you can do with the ball at your feet.\u201d So far, pretty good. Sullivan was named the best player at the CONCACAF Under-15 championships. He had a pair of assists in the 4-2 victory over Mexico in the final. The next chance to potentially catch him is Sunday in a Leagues Cup game, a tournament in the MLS regular season. \u201cRight now, we think this is the best environment for him to play in a place where he has a full support system,\u201d said Curtin, the Union\u2019s coach since 2014. Though he allows: \u201cHe\u2019s going to play at the very highest level that this sport has.\u201d Or take it from Harper, who had to get his introduction in while he can: Philly is just the genesis of what could be a fruitful career well beyond MLS. Cracked Harper: \u201cDon\u2019t forget about all of us when you go to Manchester City.\u201d AP MLS: https://apnews.com/hub/major-league-soccer"

        "body": "For many college students, dorm life is an introduction to independent living \u2014 their very first \u201chome away from home.\u201d And as exciting as this chapter is, it\u2019s also a challenge: How do you turn one room into a work, sleep and hangout space?  We got some advice from decor pros: 1. First, make sure you and your roommate/s are on the same page. \u201cTalk to your roommate and make a plan for who\u2019s bringing what,\u201d advises Lauren Phillips, associate editorial director at Better Homes & Gardens. \u201cLetting everyone feel like they have a say in the room can go a long way towards building a strong relationship.\u201d 2. Find out more about the building and room you\u2019re moving into. \u201cDoes it have a semi-private bathroom or a hall bath? Are the walls bare cement blocks or plaster? ... Shop to the space you\u2019re actually moving into,\u201d says Phillips. 3. Think twice about a loft or bunk bed. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for a few days or weeks, but by fall break, you\u2019ll regret having to climb up a ladder to go to bed every night,\u201d Phillips says. She does recommend raising the bed enough to allow for under-bed storage. In any case, bring a mattress pad for some added softness and cleanliness. 4. And speaking of storage, set aside the space and budget for it. Prioritize things like hanging rods that double your closet\u2019s capacity, over-door shoe racks, stacking bins and those under-bed organizers. 5. Bring plenty of chargers and power strips with long cords. \u201cThere almost definitely won\u2019t be enough outlets, and the ones you do have will inevitably be in inconvenient spots,\u201d says Emily White of Dormify, a website that specializes in dorm stuff. And consider furniture with built-in plugs or ports. There are headboards, bedframes and tables that fit the bill. \n 6. Stick to simple and affordable. College isn\u2019t the time for investing in high-quality pieces. \u201cBetween moving pretty much every single year... and the general wear and tear of college life, your items are going to wear out quick,\u201d Phillips notes. \u201cAnd unless you plan to have a bean bag chair in your first apartment or sleep on a twin bed forever, you probably won\u2019t take a lot of your college furnishings with you into post-college life.\u201d 7. Make a comfortable hangout. Since you can stream on other devices, a TV might not be worth the space. Phillips suggests something better: a projector. \u201cThere are great mini or portable ones now that connect easily to your device, and you can set up a movie night in just a few minutes,\u201d she says. For extra seating, get some foldable chairs, bean bags and small ottomans (ideally with built-in storage) that can be tucked away. 8. For those who want a dorm-decorating theme, White says some popular ones are \u201ccoastal beachy,\u201d \u201cmusic fan,\u201d \u201coutdoors life/nature,\u201d \u201c'70s era,\u201d \u201ccoquette\u201d and \u201cquiet luxury.\u201d 9. There\u2019s no rush. Take a beat before decorating too much or making any major changes to your dorm room. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn how you function best in this new environment throughout your first semester, so make sure your space can grow with you,\u201d says Phillips. \u2014-  New York-based writer Kim Cook covers design and decor topics regularly for The Associated Press.

        "body": "The U.S. Department of Transportation is proposing a new rule that would ban airlines from charging parents more to sit with their young children. Under the proposal, released Thursday, U.S. and foreign carriers would be required to seat children ages 13 or younger next to a parent or accompanying adult for free. If adjacent seats aren\u2019t available when a parent books a flight, airlines would be required to let families choose between a full refund or waiting to see if a seat opens up. If seats don\u2019t become available before other passengers begin boarding, airlines must give families the option to rebook for free on the next flight with available adjacent seating. The Biden administration estimates the rule could save a family of four as much as $200 in seat fees for a round trip. \u201cFlying with children is already complicated enough without having to worry about that,\u201d U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. Airlines for America, a trade association representing the industry, said in a statement that airlines already make an effort to accommodate families. \u201cEach carrier has established individual policies, and all make every effort to ensure families sit together,\u201d the group said in a statement. But Buttigieg said only four airlines \u2013 Alaska, American, Frontier and JetBlue \u2013 already guarantee that children ages 13 and under can sit next to an accompanying adult for free.  \n Congress authorized the Department of Transportation to propose a rule banning family seating fees as part of the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act, which President Joe Biden signed in May. The legislation also raises penalties for airlines that violate consumer laws and requires the Transportation Department to publish a \u201cdashboard\u201d so consumers can compare seat sizes on different airlines. The department will take comments on the proposed family seating rule for the next 60 days before it crafts a final rule.  Airlines have been pushing back against the Biden administration\u2019s campaign to eliminate what it calls \u201c junk fees.\u201d In April, the administration issued final rules requiring airlines to automatically issue cash refunds for canceled or delayed flights and to be more upfront in disclosing the fees they charge for baggage or cancellations. Airlines sued to block the fee rule and earlier this week, a three-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily stopped it from taking effect, ruling that it \u201clikely exceeds\u201d the agency\u2019s authority. The judges granted a request by airlines to halt the rule while their lawsuit plays out. Asked whether the family seating rule could face the same fate, Buttigieg noted that the Transportation Department also has the backing of Congress, which authorized the rule. \u201cAny rule we put forward, we are confident it is well-founded in our authorities,\u201d Buttigieg said during a conference call to discuss the family seating rule. This story was first published on Aug. 1, 2024. It was updated on Aug. 2, 2024 to correct the U.S. Department of Transportation rule that airlines challenged in court. It was over the disclosure of feeds, not customer refunds. "

        "body": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 The Paris Olympics at the halfway mark have brought the world \u201cThe Pommel Horse Guy, \" a rugby star and social media sensation who wants to be on reality show \u201cLove Island\u201d and \u201cThe Real John Wick\u201d in the form of a 51-year-old Turkish shooter. These Olympics have been full of memorable moments since the dazzling opening ceremony: the Seine River was too dirty for the triathlon swim to go off as scheduled, a gender controversy has emerged in women\u2019s boxing, and L\u00e9on Marchand led France with four golds in four swimming events, and of course, Simone Biles has dazzled while winning two gold medals with more still up for her taking.  Here\u2019s a look at some of the memorable moments at the halfway point of the 2024 Olympics.  The first week of the Paris Games has belonged to Biles, who went into the halfway mark with gold medals in the women\u2019s team final and the all-around and drew a star-studded crowd every time she competed. She now has nine medals in her Olympic career, including six golds, more than any other American gymnast. Biles still has three more events, too. The vault is Saturday night and she has the balance beam and floor exercise on Monday.  Three years after she pulled out of most of her events at the Tokyo Olympics to address her mental health, Biles has bounced back to become only the third woman to become a two-time all-around champion. She joined Larisa Latynina of the Soviet Union in 1956 and 1960 and Vera Caslavska of Czechoslovakia in 1964 and 1968.  \n And at 27, she\u2019s the oldest to finish atop the all-around podium since then 30-year-old Maria Gorokhovskaya of the Soviet Union won the first-ever Olympic all-around in Helsinki in 1952. The world was introduced to Stephen Nedoroscik, aka \u201cThe Pommel Horse Guy,\u201d when he helped the U.S. men\u2019s gymnastics team win its first Olympic medal in 16 years.  Paris Olympics The bespectacled 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts, sat practically still during the men\u2019s team final waiting his turn to take to the pommel horse, his only event in Paris. When it was time to go, he delivered 45 seconds of brilliance.  The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat on his dismount and Nedoroscik was an instant meme on social media.  Ilona Maher, who became a star in Tokyo with her behind-the-scenes social media posts, led the U.S. to its first ever podium in rugby sevens.  Maher has used her platform to promote body positivity and to document life in the athletes\u2019 village, which she renamed \u201cThe Villa\u201d in reference to her beloved reality show \u201cLove Island\u201d.  The unlikeliest star, though, has been Yusuf Dikec.  The 51-year-old Turkish pistol shooter went viral on social media for a seemingly casual attitude while shooting his way to a silver medal in mixed 10-meter air pistol. Commenters called him \u201cThe Real John Wick\u201d after the Keanu Reeves character in \u201cThe Matrix\u201d series.  Dikec was shooting in a T-shirt, one hand in his pocket, a seemingly standard pair of glasses and an impassive look on his face. He\u2019s been likened to a regular guy competing at the Olympics, or even a hitman. An Algerian boxer is facing a gender outcry after her Italian competitor pulled out seconds into their bout. Imane Khelif has faced vitriol from former U.S. President Donald Trump and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni. Khelif was disqualified from the 2023 world championships after failing unspecified and not transparent eligibility tests for women\u2019s competition from the now-banned International Boxing Association. Khelif was assigned female at birth and it says so on her passport, which is the International Olympic Committee\u2019s threshold for eligibility for boxing. The pool has belonged to Marchand, who electrified a home crowd Friday night when he won his fourth gold by setting an Olympic record in the 200-meter individual medley. He also won gold in the 400 individual medley, 200 butterfly and 200 backstroke. Ledecky will look to tie Michael Phelps as the only two swimmers to win four gold medals in the same event. Ledecky is seeking a four-peat of the women\u2019s 800 freestyle, an event she first won in the 2012 London Olympics. Another win would be the ninth Olympic gold of her career, which would be tied for second for the most gold medals in the Olympics, Summer or Winter, in any sport.  Phelps, who won the 200 individual medley four times, won 23 gold medals. The opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage for a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers.  Although artistic director Thomas Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d critics interpreted part of the show as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting showing Jesus Christ and his apostles. Now, Paris police have opened a hate speech investigation following a complaint from Jolly over death threats. Organizers have been adamant in their insistence the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events could safely be held in the Seine River amidst health questions about the quality of the water.  After several delays for elevated levels of bacteria, the triathlon swims were held and the views played well on television as athletes cycled and ran by Paris\u2019 finest attractions. It was all part of an ambitious plan to clean up the long-polluted Seine, spending 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements. A few swim practice sessions needed to be scratched and the men\u2019s race pushed back a day due to water quality. AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Three years into the new age of college sports, where athletes are allowed to profit from their successes through name, image and likeness deals, everyone is still trying to find out what the new normal will be. Greg Sankey, commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, called it \u201cuncharted waters of change\u201d in July at SEC Media Days in Dallas, as college football season approaches. \u201cAnytime you go through a reset, it is difficult,\u201d said Sankey, whose conference not only includes perennial powerhouses Georgia and Alabama, but, as of this year, Texas and Oklahoma, as well. Those uncharted waters aren\u2019t limited to football. The complicated, often murky, world of NIL has touched not just every corner of college sports, but also had an unanticipated effect on the charitable organizations that popped up to help players secure these sponsorship deals.  The basic question NIL raises for nonprofits is: What is charitable about paying college players? To unravel how NIL deals in college sports have anything to do with the nature of tax-exempt organizations, we have to go back to 2021. That\u2019s when a Supreme Court decision forced the NCAA to allow players to be paid for the use of their name, image and likeness. The ruling allowed players to finally enter into sponsorship and endorsement deals \u2014 including everything from the much-anticipated EA Sports College Football 25 video game to promotional appearances for local restaurants and car dealerships. Fallout from the Supreme Court decision continues, with rules governing NIL deals evolving in response to new lawsuits and state laws. Initially, the NCAA prohibited colleges and universities from directly paying their players, though that may soon change. But to bridge that gap, a cottage industry of outside groups popped up to facilitate contracts between boosters and athletes.  \n Some of those outside groups formed as companies \u2014 where fans gave them money and the groups, after taking a small cut, passed it on to the school\u2019s athletes. In return, the athletes are supposed to perform some service for the group, like autographing merchandise or posting on social media. Other groups incorporated as nonprofit organizations and applied successfully to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status.  \u201cThe worry was there\u2019s going to be a narrative perception from the public that this is just greedy athletes, right? So we\u2019ve got to clean that up, and the way you do that, as always, is nonprofit work, charity work,\u201d said Darrell Lovell, assistant professor of political science at West Texas A&M University, who has written a book about NIL initiatives. What percentage of these new organizations are for-profit and what percentage are nonprofit? Hard to say, since no one entity is monitoring all of them. The NCAA recently contracted with a company to create a voluntary registry for agents, service providers and deals over $600, which may yield better information about the estimated $1.2 billion flowing through NIL collectives. On the nonprofit side, however, last June, the IRS issued a memo stating that the activities of many NIL nonprofits were not tax-exempt. In essence, the agency wrote that NIL deals serve the private interests of players, but not the public good. Phil Hackney, associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s law school, said the IRS offers tax-exempt status for organizations that probably should not qualify \u201chappens more often than we might think.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s probably a lot of nonprofits that nobody\u2019s focusing on that probably ought not have an exemption, but they do,\u201d said Hackney, who formerly worked in the IRS\u2019 Office of Chief Counsel. IRS spokesperson Anthony Burke said in May that the agency has a compliance strategy to make sure NIL nonprofits are \u201cin full compliance with the existing legal requirements,\u201d but did not elaborate. Since January, the IRS has released three rulings denying tax-exempt status for specific, but unnamed, organizations offering NIL contracts with college players. Some nonprofit NIL collectives continue to operate, though others have closed.  The Texas One Fund that supports the Texas Longhorns still promotes its tax-exempt status on its website and hosted a fundraising concert in the football stadium in May. It did not respond to a request for comment. Athletes at the University of Utah last year received leases to new cars, in one of the highest profile NIL deals. The Crimson Collective, which is the school\u2019s official NIL, is registered as a nonprofit in Utah and has successfully applied for tax-exempt status from the IRS. Its most recent tax filing from 2022 indicates that it reported having less than $50,000 in revenue.  Erin Trenbeath-Murray, vice president of philanthropy for Ken Garff Enterprises and the Crimson Collective, said the organization was not involved in facilitating the leases and that its purpose is to support other charities in the state, like Make A Wish Foundation, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Junior Achievement and other nonprofits. The Cohesion Foundation, which supports Ohio State athletes, said it stopped collecting new donations after the IRS memo, but paid out its contracts through the end of last year. Executive director Dan Apple said the collective is currently \u201cinactive\u201d but hasn\u2019t taken down its website or publicly announced its closure in case something changes again. These nonprofits continue, in part, because large donors like to give through charitable vehicles so that they can take a tax deduction. \u201cWhere the big dollars come in and I\u2019m talking six figures,\u201d said Tom Dieters, president of the nonprofit organization Charitable Gift America, \u201cThose come from grants. From donor-advised funds. Private foundations. Charitable trusts. We\u2019ve even got a charitable IRA rollover money. You can only get those gifts as a public charity.\u201d  Dieters said his organization helps donors enter into NIL contracts with players at 10 schools around the country, including his alma mater, Michigan State. In return, athletes promote Charitable Gift America \u2014 through social media posts, for example.  \u201cWe\u2019re not unlike a car dealership that would promote their cars,\u201d Dieters said. \u201cWe just promote philanthropy.\u201d  Brian Mittendorf, the H.P. Wolfe Chair in accounting at Ohio State, said he sees some window where it could be possible for a tax-exempt organization to enter into NIL contracts, but it would be a tricky line to draw. A nonprofit that existed before it started offering NIL contracts still must ensure its work furthers its charitable mission, he said. \u201c(Organizations should) be able to demonstrate that the contracts they enter into are in furtherance of that charitable purpose and not to benefit any individuals in particular,\u201d Mittendorf said. In the upcoming school year, the waters remain uncharted following a $2.8 billion settlement reached between the NCAA and the nation\u2019s five biggest conferences that could create a revenue-sharing model with their athletes. At least one school, Houston Christian, has objected in court to the settlement arguing that it will divert money to sports from schools\u2019 core missions of education and research.  Elsewhere, Virginia recently passed a law allowing schools to make NIL deals with players. Other states are wrestling with whether players can unionize.  Hackney sees momentum for schools directly paying players somehow, though he argues that will further challenge whether the schools primarily serve a charitable education mission. \u201cThe system that allows this major business, major TV athletic product business, to operate as a charitable activity has long been problematic,\u201d he said, in part because until recently, the athletes doing the work have not been paid.  \u201cGetting dollars to athletes for the real work that they do is important,\u201d Hackney said. \u201cBut once you\u2019re starting to pay them, you\u2019re no longer operating a charity where you\u2019re honestly there to educate these athletes. You\u2019re there to pay them for a transactional business that\u2019s not charitable anymore.\u201d  Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "body": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Gliding above her neighborhood in a cable car on a recent morning, Sonia Estefan\u00eda Palacios D\u00edaz scanned a sea of blue and black water tanks, tubes and cables looking for rain harvesting systems. \u201cThere\u2019s one!\u201d she said, pointing out a black tank hooked up to a smaller blue unit with connecting tubes snaking up to the roof where water is collected. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for different rainwater harvesting systems,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m also always looking for places to install one.\u201d Driven by prolonged drought and inconsistent public water delivery, many Mexico City residents are turning to rainwater. Pioneering company Isla Urbana, which does both nonprofit and for-profit work, has installed more than 40,000 rain catchment systems across Mexico since the company was founded 15 years ago. And Mexico City\u2019s government has invested in the installation of 70,000 systems since 2019, still a drop in the bucket for the sprawling metropolis of around 9 million. But there\u2019s little education and limited resources to maintain the systems after installation, leading the systems to fall into disuse or for residents to sell off the parts.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) Enter Palacios D\u00edaz and a group of other women who make up the cooperative Pixcatl, which means harvest of water in the Indigenous Nahuatl language. In lower-income areas like Iztapalapa \u2014 Mexico City\u2019s most populous borough \u2014 the group tries to keep systems functioning while also educating residents on how to maintain them. That includes brainstorming their own designs and providing residents with low-cost options for additional materials.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) \n Palacios D\u00edaz has lived with water scarcity in Iztapalapa as far back as she can remember. \u201cHere, people will get in line starting at 3 in the morning to get water (from distribution trucks) up until 2 in the afternoon,\u201d she said from her mother\u2019s home. \u201cThere was a time in which we went for more than a month without a regular supply of water.\u201d Earlier this year, the reservoirs that supply the capital were perilously low. Authorities reduced the amount of water being released and neighborhoods not accustomed to water scarcity faced a new reality. Entering the rainy season, most of Mexico was in moderate to severe drought. Mexico\u2019s reservoirs are beginning to approach half their capacity, but they haven\u2019t filled by much, according to recent reports by the National Water Commission.  The country depends on the rains \u2014 which normally peter out in October \u2014 to fill the reservoirs, but the drought has taken them so low that that might take years. That\u2019s encouraged many Mexicans like Palacios D\u00edaz to turn to rainwater harvesting.  At the height of the pandemic, she taught classes on urban farming and water harvesting at a local community space. It wasn\u2019t until her students said they wanted to learn how to install and understand their own systems that she seriously considered taking a government course. After enrolling in a training program in 2022 to become an installer, she met other young women from the city interested in water harvesting systems and they formed the cooperative.  Near the skirt of a volcano on the fringes of Iztapalapa, Lizbeth Esther Pineda Castro, another member of the cooperative, and Palacios D\u00edaz adjusted a ladder to reach the roof of a small house. The two-story home inherited by Sara Huitzil Morales and her niece sits in Iztapalapa\u2019s Buenavista neighborhood.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) Huitzil\u2019s mother had qualified for a free water harvesting system from Mexico City\u2019s government in 2021. After the installation, Huitzil requested Pixcatl\u2019s maintenance since she wasn\u2019t sure how to take care of the system. Sporting their navy polos with the Pixcatl logo, Pineda and Palacios D\u00edaz cleared debris off the roof so the system only collects fresh rain. \u201cWe also add a little bit of soap and chlorine to clean the pipes,\u201d said Palacios D\u00edaz as she swept the liquid down a connecting tube that leads to the harvesting system. Downstairs, they joined the other members of the cooperative in a courtyard to look at the giant 2,500-liter water tank, enough to serve Huitzil\u2019s needs for several months when filled. The colossal container stood nearly as tall as Palacios D\u00edaz. Another cooperative member cleared a filter of leaves and dirt.  Abigail Lopez Duran cleans the roof of a house to collect rainwater in the neighborhood of Iztapalpa in Mexico City, Sunday, July 21, 2024. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) Last, Palacios D\u00edaz plopped in a couple of chlorine pills to clean and disinfect the water. The frequency of the entire maintenance process depends on several factors, including how much water is in the tank, how much has been used, and whether it has rained.  Huitzil said before the harvesting system, she endured water shortages and rationing. The publicly available water was consistently dirty and \u201cdark like chocolate.\u201d She often used the water that remained from doing laundry to clean the courtyard. Sometimes when dirty water would arrive, she would put it in buckets and wait for the dirt to settle to the bottom, using the cleanest for showering.  The system has transformed her daily use of water, and she doesn\u2019t have to think twice about whether it\u2019s safe. The system initially uses six filters, plus three more if the water is to be used for drinking. \u201cThe water is good, it\u2019s so good!\u201d said Huitzil. \u201cMy clothes come out very clean and the water is sweet. You can even harvest it to be cleaner to drink.\u201d With over 1.8 million residents, Iztapalapa has been one of the primary beneficiaries of Mexico City\u2019s harvesting system program. But after two years, the city stopped giving away free systems when many residents, facing economic hardship and sometimes struggling to maintain the systems, sold off their parts.  \u201cIt should be easy to maintain, but it\u2019s tedious,\u201d Palacios Diaz said. \u201cUnfortunately, we find ourselves in a scenario in which we not only have environmental problems, but economic problems.\u201d Loreta Castro Reguera, an architecture professor at Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University, focuses much of her work on water and urban design. She said rainwater harvesting is a great solution because during Mexico\u2019s rainy season residents can use rainwater instead of water from the Cutzamala system \u2014 a reservoir that provides water to Mexico City and the State of Mexico.

The cooperative is also working on designs personalized for their clients\u2019 needs \u2014 whether for a low-cost system or to fulfill a greater demand for water. As women, she and the other members of Pixcatl want to set an example for those who want to get involved in water harvesting. \u201cI think it\u2019s really beautiful we can inspire young girls and show women in another context,\u201d said another member, Abigail L\u00f3pez Dur\u00e1n, \u201cthat we can also use tools and aren\u2019t afraid to get hurt.\u201d Some vegetables and lettuces grow in community garden in Mexico City, Sunday, July 14, 2024.

For Werth it was an eighth Olympic gold medal and increased her overall medal tally to 13, all in dressage and more than any equestrian.  Werth, riding Wendy, was joined on the podium by Jessica von Bredow-Werndl and Frederic Wandres. Bredow-Werndl was on Dalera, the horse which helped her win individual dressage gold at the Tokyo Games three years.  Germany\u2019s overall score was 235.790, just 0.121 ahead of Denmark on 235.669. Britain took the bronze medal with 232.492. The German team had qualified for the final in first place and held off strong pressure from Denmark, which was led by the top-ranked Cathrine Dufour-Laudrup on Freestyle.  She had the best performance of the day with 81.216, making her the only rider among the 10 teams to score 80 points. Daniel Bachmann Andersen on Vayron and Nanna Skodborg Merrald were Denmark\u2019s other medalists. The British trio were Becky Moody (Jagerbomb), Carl Hester (Fame) and Charlotte Fry (Glamourdale).  The 57-year-old Hester competed at the 1992 Barcelona Games, where he was the youngest British rider ever to compete at the Olympics. Werth also competed at Barcelona, where she won her first Olympic gold in team dressage.  \n Snoop Dogg was part of the equestrian crowd at the Palace of Versailles, where he wore a black riding helmet and sunglasses.

A week later, back in his element as a doubles player, Ebden will leave France as a gold medalist with partner John Peers. Ebden and Peers won Australia\u2019s second tennis gold medal in Summer Games history on Saturday, beating Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram of the United States 6-7 (6), 7-6 (1), 10-8 in a match tiebreaker in the men\u2019s doubles final. Olympics doubles uses a first-to-10, win-by-two tiebreaker in place of a traditional third set. \u201cI knew this would come up,\u201d Ebden said when asked about the way his Summer Games began. \u201cLast night, I did think of it. I was actually dreaming of an Instagram post, like: \u2018How it started; how it\u2019s going.\u2019 ... Swipe right, and there\u2019s a gold-medal photo.\u201d Ebden and Peers trailed by a set and 4-2 in the second before breaking Ram\u2019s serve to begin the comeback. Their tennis gold follows the one won for Australia by Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde in men\u2019s doubles at Atlanta in 1996. \u201cIt\u2019s trippy. It\u2019s more than a dream. I didn\u2019t even dream of winning a gold medal growing up or whatever,\u201d Ebden said. \u201cThe last few years, I had great success on the doubles court. It gave a lot of belief and confidence coming in here.\u201d  He is a 36-year-old doubles specialist who has been ranked No. 1 in that event and has won two Slam trophies in men\u2019s doubles and one in mixed. In singles? Until facing Djokovic \u2014 \u201cMy main goal in that match was just not to get injured,\u201d Ebden joked Saturday \u2014 he hadn\u2019t competed in a tour-level, main-draw singles match since June 2022.  \n Djokovic said he thinks the rules should be changed so someone like Ebden does not wind up on the court in singles at the Summer Games. Paris Olympics Ebden hasn\u2019t even had a singles ranking since he was No. 970 the week of May 29, 2023. But he already was in Paris to compete in men\u2019s doubles and so that made him available for the singles competition when 16th-ranked Holger Rune of Denmark pulled out because of a wrist injury. When Saturday\u2019s match ended, the children of Peers and Ebden climbed out of the stands to hug their fathers. Ebden draped a replica gold medal around the neck of his son, whom he then tossed in the air and caught. Peers, who won a bronze in mixed doubles with Ash Barty at the Tokyo Games three years ago, said his oldest daughter has been saying she wanted a gold. Now she can bring it to school for show-and-tell. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be talking about this one,\u201d Peers said, \u201cuntil we\u2019re 100.\u201d Peers won a bronze in mixed doubles with Ash Barty at the Tokyo Games three years ago. He has been No. 2 in doubles and owns one Grand Slam title each in men\u2019s doubles \u2014 which came by beating twins Bob and Mike Bryan in the final of the 2017 Australian Open \u2014 and mixed doubles. The 40-year-old Ram, who is based in Indiana, was trying to become the oldest player to win an Olympics tennis gold \u2014 for men or women, in singles or doubles \u2014 since the sport returned to the Summer Games in 1988.  He and Krajicek, a 34-year-old who lives in Florida, also were trying to become the third U.S. duo to win a men\u2019s doubles gold. The most recent had been the Bryans at London in 2012. The brothers were in the stands Saturday \u2014 Bob is the country\u2019s men\u2019s tennis coach in Paris, and Mike has been serving as a hitting partner and helping coach doubles. Instead, Ram and Krajicek \u2014 who eliminated Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz in the quarterfinals \u2014 will head home with silvers.  Later Saturday, another American duo, Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul, won the bronze with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Tomas Machac and Adam Pavlasek of the Czech Republic. Machac and Katerina Siniakova won the gold in mixed doubles on Friday night. Associated Press writer Tom Nouvian contributed to this report.

        "body": "For many people of a certain age, high school gym class began with reaching for their toes. Then, over the years, we were told it was better to stretch after exercise.  It turns out, both those things can be true, but the differing advice has created some confusion. Stretching can help make you more flexible, improve range of motion in your joints \u2014 and feel good. David Behm, who researches human kinetics at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John\u2019s, Canada, offers this advice on when to stretch and how to do it safely: It\u2019s almost always good to stretch, but it\u2019s better if you warm up first, said Behm, author of \u201cThe Science and Physiology of Flexibility and Stretching.\u201d He recommends a light aerobic activity such as jogging, walking or cycling for five or 10 minutes.  Follow that with some static stretching, the traditional way of reaching and holding a position (think back to that gym class). You can then do activity-specific dynamic stretching, in which you warm up the muscles with repetitive movements like leg lifts. Behm says one minute is \u201cthe magic number\u201d for how long to do static stretching per muscle group without fatigue. Should you always stretch before exercising? If it\u2019s traditional stretching, not necessarily.  This article is part of AP\u2019s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. The better question, Behm says, is, \u201cShould people increase their range of motion? Should people have better flexibility? And that is yes, because it helps prevent injuries. It helps with health. But you don\u2019t have to stretch to achieve that.\u201d \n Resistance training, for instance, can be an effective form of stretching, he said. Doing a chest press increases range of motion in your deltoids and pecs, whether with barbells, dumbbells or machines, so there is no need to stretch beforehand. Just make sure to start with a small amount of weight to warm up and then add more to train. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t have to do extra stretching unless you\u2019re a gymnast, a figure skater, or even a golfer who needs a great range of motion through that swing,\u201d Behm said. Nor do you need to stretch first if you\u2019re going for a leisurely run. Simply start with a slow jog to warm up and then increase the pace. After exercise, \u201clight stretching is OK, as long as you don\u2019t reach a point where you\u2019re feeling pain,\u201d Behm said. Since your muscles will be warm by that point, overdoing it makes you more likely to injure yourself. Foam rollers can help with muscle recovery and have been shown to increases range of motion as well as stretching. If you\u2019re playing a sport, Behm said, static stretching beforehand helps reduce muscle and tendon injury. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do an explosive movement, change of direction, agility, sprint, any of these explosive activities that involve your muscles and tendons,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be stronger if you do static stretching.\u201d People can especially get in trouble when they go back to a sport they used to play, whether it\u2019s tennis, surfing or any sort of team activity. Also, stretch both sides equally. Lacking flexibility on one side also can lead to injury. Different studies over the years have either encouraged or discouraged stretching before exercise. Behm says that partly because some studies didn\u2019t reflect real-life conditions, or were designed with elite athletes in mind, not regular people. \u201cIf you\u2019re Usain Bolt, it makes a difference,\u201d said Behm. Not so much for the rest of us. Albert Stumm writes about food, travel and wellness. Find his work at https://www.albertstumm.com"

        "body": "BORDEAUX, France (AP) \u2014 France players say they used an offensive song about their heritage as motivation to beat soccer rival Argentina at the Paris Olympics. Players from both sides clashed on the field immediately after France\u2019s 1-0 quarterfinal victory. To many observers the fracas seemed inevitable. Friday night\u2019s game was played amid high tensions in the wake of a racism scandal following a video showing Argentina\u2019s senior-team players celebrating after winning the Copa America last month and singing an offensive song about the African heritage of France\u2019s players. \u201cA great rivalry has been created between two great soccer nations. But given what\u2019s been said in the past few weeks our victory is there, on the field and off it,\u201d France captain Alexandre Lacazette said. \u201cWe had in mind what was said (in the video). We had to stay focused on the Olympic Games, but maybe it did give us a little bit of extra motivation for us \u2014 and for France.\u201d The chief provocateur on Friday was France midfielder Enzo Millot, who admitted that he goaded the Argentines with an element of payback for that video. \u201cI went to celebrate the victory in front of their bench, yes, it was to wind them up a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were thinking about it (the video), it spurred us on.\u201d Striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, who scored France\u2019s goal with a powerful early header, concurred. \u201cThe controversy? Yes, maybe that did serve to motivate us,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know the Argentines, they wanted to spoil the party. But you can\u2019t spoil the party, they made it even better.\u201d \n Argentina\u2019s players chased Millot around the field as the situation threatened to spiral out of control, before things calmed down after a couple of wild minutes. \u201cAs soon as we saw who we were playing we were glad to be playing against them,\u201d said Millot, who plays for Stuttgart in Germany\u2019s Bundesliga. \u201cIt\u2019s a good war between two nations.\u201d Paris Olympics Soccer\u2019s governing body FIFA opened an investigation into the video after the French soccer federation filed a complaint, while Premier League club Chelsea said it would deal internally with midfielder Enzo Fernandez, who was at the heart of the controversy. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that such things are said in 2024,\u201d Lacazette said, referring to the refrain. \u201cBut we have faith in FIFA.\u201d The fallout from that reached political levels in Argentina, led to leaders of both governments talking things through in Paris, and continued to simmer until it erupted on Friday night in Bordeaux. The balmy southwestern French city is more associated with its superb red wines \u2014 the best of them have been certified as Grand Cru Class\u00e9 since 1855 and are renowned worldwide \u2014 than for soccer violence. France\u2019s win made it 2-1 to Les Bleus in recent meetings between the sides, but the game might be best remembered for how it ended. \u201cThe scenes at the end represent everything you don\u2019t want to see,\u201d France coach Thierry Henry said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like what happened from our side, I can\u2019t tolerate it.\u201d Argentina goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli said France\u2019s players lacked humility. \u201cSometimes we have players that don\u2019t know how to win. It was something avoidable, not a nice image for anyone,\u201d Rulli told the TyC network. \u201cWhen we lose a match, we congratulate the opponent and leave. I think they had something boiling over for a while and they let it go today.\u201d Veteran Argentina defender Nicolas Otamendi, the captain, said France players were disrespectful in their celebrations. \u201cI\u2019m upset,\u201d he told TyC. \u201cPlayers can celebrate however they want to, but not in front of where the fans are, the family members.\u201d In different circumstances, the match itself could have been the latest installment in an emerging rivalry that produced two pulsating World Cup matches in 2018 and 2022. The first propelled Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 into the spotlight when he scored an incredible solo goal during a 4-3 win in the 2018 round of 16, taking center stage from Lionel Messi. France went on to win, with Mbapp\u00e9 scoring in the final. Four years later, Argentina won a dramatic shootout following a thrilling 3-3 draw. Mbapp\u00e9 became only the second player to score a hat trick in the World Cup final yet ended on the losing team as Messi inspired Argentina to its third World Cup title, denying France its third in the process.

        "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) \u2014 Noah Lyles walks around the Olympic Village in disguise, wearing sunglasses, a hat and even a mask to cut down on some of the attention he receives. On the track, he can\u2019t avoid it. Or everyone\u2019s best shot. It\u2019s a lesson he learned when finishing second in his opening heat of the 100 meters Saturday at the Paris Games. The American got off to a sluggish start and finished in 10.04 seconds, which was .06 behind Louie Hinchliffe, a British sprinter being trained by Carl Lewis. Going against Lyles is always a big deal. \u201cThese boys said they were coming to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my first lesson in underestimating the power of the Olympics. When somebody\u2019s on the line, they\u2019re going to give it their all or nothing. \u201cBut now I don\u2019t have to hold back. I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d Lyles was clowning around before settling into the starting blocks. He preened for the camera, flashed his Team USA-themed nail polish \u2014 the color blue with stars \u2014and threw some imaginary jabs like a prizefighter. He fed off the noise from the packed stadium. Once the race started, he needed to tap into an extra gear to climb back into second. \u201cTo be honest, I was kind of playing my cards close to the chest,\u201d Lyles explained. The second-place finish means Lyles, the reigning world champion at 100 and 200 meters, won\u2019t have the premier lane choice when he races in the semifinals Sunday. If he advances from that, he\u2019ll race for the gold medal later in the evening. \n \u201cI downplayed my competitors for sure,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cI was like, \u2018There\u2019s no reason to really put any emphasis on it.\u2019 But these guys proved to me that they\u2019re ready to compete. I said, \u2018All right, I can\u2019t do that anymore.\u2019 I promise that will not happen again.\u201d Also advancing in the early heats were Kishane Thompson of Jamaica, who slowed over last 20 meters and still won his heat in 10 seconds flat. Thompson\u2019s heat was delayed several minutes after British sprinter Jeremiah Azu was called for a false start. Azu looked at the replay and pleaded his case with the officials before leaving the track. Ferdinand Omanyala of Kenya won his heat in 10.08 and Oblique Seville of Jamaica won his in 9.99. Reigning Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs, who said he was bitten by an insect while in the starting blocks, finished second in his heat to advance. \u201cI made a few mistakes at the start,\u201d Jacobs said, \u201cwhich didn\u2019t allow me to get the pace that I wanted.\u201d Lyles\u2019 U.S. teammates, Fred Kerley and Kenny Bednarek, won their heats in strong fashion, too, both going 9.97. \u201cThis year, I\u2019m changing the narrative. I\u2019ve been the underdog for a couple of years,\u201d said Bednarek, a silver medalist in the 200 meters at the Tokyo Olympics. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the underdog, I\u2019m trying to be the top dog. Once I finally hit that milestone, I\u2019m not coming back. I\u2019m going to run away with it.\u201d For Lyles, this was just business. After his race, he even approached Hinchliffe with words of encouragement. \u201cJust, \u2018Well done,\u2019\u201d Hinchliffe said of their conversation. \u201cJust acknowledging me.\u201d Lyles said the pressure of the world championships last summer was more than he\u2019s felt so far at these Olympics. \u201cI felt like I had to fight to prove that I was the fastest,\u201d said Lyles, one of the stars of a Netflix documentary on sprinters. \u201cThis time, a lot of people know it and I already have the target on my back.\u201d He\u2019s not sure what kind of time it\u2019s going to take to claim Olympic gold but he is confident of this: \u201cI\u2019m going to run it,\u201d Lyles said. Abbey Caldwell of Australia was one of the women\u2019s 800-meter runners who took advantage of the safety net that is the repechage round to move on to the semifinals. This is the first Olympics where track has used the repechage rule, which gives a second chance to hurdlers and to sprinters and middle-distance runners who don\u2019t move on from their opening heats in the 200 through 1,500 meters. Caldwell grabbed one of the six spots available. \u201cI\u2019m very fortunate and super happy,\u201d Caldwell said. It was an easy day of qualifying for defending Olympic pole vault champion Mondo Duplantis. The Swedish world-record holder took just two jumps and cleared both heights. \u201cA boring qualifying in a way, which I wanted,\u201d Duplantis said. \u201cAs uneventful as I wanted.\u201d American Sam Kendricks made it through but his teammate Christopher Nilsen, the Olympic silver medalist in Tokyo, didn\u2019t advance. Comoros sprinter Hachim Maaroufou wears a hat turned backward when he races for one simple reason \u2014 it makes it easier for family and friends to spot him. ... Shaun Gill, who represents Belize, is calling it a career so he can become an industrial engineer. \u201cTime to gain that real-world experience of an engineer,\u201d the 31-year-old graduate of Texas A&M University Kingsville said.

        "body": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 More than 100 conflicts fester around the world. The Middle East teeters on the brink of a regional war. In Ukraine, Russia advances slowly but steadily in the east, reducing towns to rubble.  The \u201cOlympic Truce,\u201d clearly, is not being heeded. In the run-up to every Olympics over the past 30 years, the United Nations passes a resolution upholding the Olympic Truce, which in theory halts hostilities in the name of granting athletes safe passage and promoting world peace. It\u2019s supposed to last from seven days before the Olympic Games begin until seven days after the Paralympic Games end. Not even two weeks into it, the news of missile strikes, annexations and heightened tensions is omnipresent. \u201cStepping into the Olympic Village, you realize like generations of Olympians before: `Now I am part of something bigger than myself. Now we are part of an event that unites the world in peace,\u2019\u201d International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said to athletes at the opening ceremony. He did temper his usual robust optimism with an acknowledgment that they lived in \u201ca world torn apart by wars and conflicts.\u201d It\u2019s a pitch the IOC has made often enough that it has become part of the brand that the Games project: the Olympics as the great uniter, one that has the potential to transcend all divides.  Reality, though, can interrupt even the tightest messaging. \n By Wednesday, in the wake of the assassination in Iran of Hamas\u2019 top leader, the international body had scaled down and adopted a more dejected tone. \u201cA culture of peace is what we try to create in a very modest way,\u201d IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said at a news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re unable to bring peace. We can call for peace, but we probably won\u2019t achieve it.\u201d For an organization that has often waded into geopolitics \u2014 the normally stoic Bach choked up last week while remembering his late friend Henry Kissinger\u2019s \u201cinvaluable advice\u201d \u2014 Adams\u2019 remarks seemed to signal a retreat in the IOC\u2019s ambitions, at least in the moment. \u201cWe can only do what we can do. We\u2019re a sports organization,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is to let the politicians, unfortunately, get on with what they want to get on with.\u201d The Olympic Truce was revived in the immediate post-Cold War era, with roots in ancient Greece.  \u201cWe live in a divided world where conflicts are proliferating in a dramatic way. The horrendous suffering in Gaza, the seemingly endless war in Ukraine, terrible suffering from Sudan to the DRC, from the Sahel to Myanmar,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said after meeting with Bach before the opening ceremony. \u201cIn a moment like this, it is important to say that the first recording in history (of a) real peace initiative was the Olympic Truce.\u201d Then and now, it\u2019s never quite worked. Russia alone has broken the Truce three times, most recently in 2022 with the invasion of Ukraine \u2014 a handful of months after the country voted for the U.N. resolution. (This time, it abstained.) In November, 118 countries voted to adopt the resolution. No country voted against it, although Syria joined Russia in abstaining. In past years, the resolution received more full-throated support \u2014 the U.N. has 193 member-states, after all \u2014 but among those who voted for \u201cbuilding a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal\u201d were Iran, Israel and Lebanon, all embroiled in the latest flare-up. \u201cWhen we talk about sports, uniting people and bringing people together, yes, that is an aspirational ideal,\u201d said Lindsay Sarah Krasnoff, a sports diplomacy expert who lectures at New York University\u2019s Tisch Institute for Global Sport. \u201cAnd a lot of that is reality. When you look at, typically speaking, sport does have that power.\u201d The Olympics, she says, are an implement in the toolbox of striving for peace. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Games themselves can transcend the worlds wars, conflicts, and complex, complicated problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think what they can do is provide pockets of space for people to have these conversations.\u201d Ultimately, the Truce is well-intentioned but toothless. There are no consequences to breaking it, aside from possible condemnation in the court of global public opinion.  For example: Ahead of the Games, French President Emmanuel Macron publicly suggested a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine during the days of competition. Not unexpectedly, both sides refused, and the war goes on with the same intensity. Russia and Belarus have been barred from the Paris Games after a lengthy campaign from Ukraine\u2019s Olympic committee, which argued that Russian athletes should not compete even under a neutral flag, while Moscow\u2019s troops persist with their deadly invasion. (Some Russian and Belarusian athletes are still competing as neutrals, approval contingent on not supporting the war. That allowance has not endeared the Games to its erstwhile host country. ) Ukrainian athletes are under no illusion about Olympic idealism. For them, the Olympics are no longer about their achievements but rather proof that their country is still alive despite the war that began while the last Olympic flame was still lit. They do not see the Games as respite from the war; it\u2019s a way to shout loudly about it so the world doesn\u2019t forget. Zoriana Nevmerzhytska, 31, attended a flash mob in view of the Eiffel Tower to highlight the hundreds of Ukrainian athletes and coaches, both amateur and professional, who have been killed. Participants bore posters that read \u201cworld champions in raping,\u201d depicting Russian soldiers, and \u201cunmarked troops,\u201d referring to the neutral athletes. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not about something that promotes peace,\u201d she said of the Olympics. \u201cIt can be about unity, but not this time.\u201d  There will be a next time, though. When asked why the world keeps returning to the Truce for Olympics after Olympics, despite incessant conflict, Krasnoff noted that \u201cwe all like the idea that sport in and of itself can be omnipotent, even though we know in reality it is not.\u201d \u201cI mean, that\u2019s kind of the whole thing about sports,\u201d she said, drawing an analogy. \u201cYou don\u2019t dwell on what you haven\u2019t been able to achieve in a given performance. You say, \u2018OK, well, that was that game. On to the next.\u2019\u201d AP Sports Writer Graham Dunbar contributed from Paris.

He was seen arriving at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware Tuesday afternoon for a flight back to Washington, according to a White House pool report. Multiple AP photos show Biden at the base. The president is expected to address the nation from the Oval Office Wednesday evening. THE FACTS: Following a positive COVID-19 test and his announcement on Sunday that he had dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, social media users are pointing to the Capitol flags as alleged proof that Biden has passed on. \u201cCapitol Flags are flying Half mast,\u201d reads one X post that shared two screenshots showing live views of the Capitol. \u201cJoe Biden is dead.\u201d Another X post that also included an image of the Capitol stated: \u201cFlag is at half mast at the Capitol Building in D.C. Biden is dead and they killed him. Will blame on Covid.\u201d Other users shared screenshots of Capitol live streams, while claiming that they showed the White House flag at half-staff. It is true that the Capitol flags could be seen at half-staff on Tuesday in live shots of the building. But they have been lowered in honor of Jackson Lee, not Biden, Johnson\u2019s office confirmed to the AP. White House live streams showed its flags were seen at full-staff on Tuesday. \n Jackson Lee, a Democrat who helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday, died Friday night. She announced that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on June 2. Biden is alive. He arrived at Dover Air Force Base at 1:41 p.m. on Tuesday for a flight back to Washington after isolating with COVID-19 at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, according to a White House pool report. He exited his motorcade at 1:44 p.m. and responded, \u201cI\u2019m feeling well,\u201d when asked about his health. The president boarded Air Force One at 1:45 p.m. Multiple AP photos show Biden at the base. Biden was previously last seen in public late Wednesday after arriving at the same Dover base, after testing positive for COVID-19 while campaigning in Las Vegas earlier in the day. The president\u2019s physician, Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor, said on Tuesday that Biden tested negative for COVID-19 and that he continues to perform all of his presidential duties. \u201cThe President\u2019s symptoms have resolved,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote in a White House memo. \u201cOver the course of his infection, he never manifested a fever, and his vital signs remained normal, to include pulse oximetry. His lungs remained clear.\u201d In an X post, Biden wrote that he will address the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday evening \u201con what lies ahead\u201d and how he will \u201cfinish the job for the American people.\u201d___This is part of the AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared false and misleading information that is circulating online.

        "body": "Exxon Mobil recorded one of its largest second-quarter profits in a decade on surging quarterly production from oil and gas fields in Guyana and the Permian basin in the U.S., as well its $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources.  The Texas oil and gas giant earned $9.24 billion, or $2.14 per share, for the three months ended June 30, topping last year\u2019s profit of $7.88 billion, or $1.94 per share. The results topped Wall Street expectations, though Exxon does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research were expecting earnings of $2.04 per share. \u201cWe achieved record quarterly production from our low-cost-of-supply Permian and Guyana assets, with the highest oil production since the Exxon and Mobil merger,\u201d Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a prepared statement Friday.  The Pioneer deal contributed $500 million to earnings in the first two months after closing, Exxon said.  Revenue for the Spring, Texas, company totaled $93.06 billion, topping Wall Street\u2019s expectations for $90.38 billion. Exxon\u2019s net production reached 4.4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day during the second quarter, an increase of 15% compared with the first three months of the year.  Oil prices are lower than they were at this point last year, and those high prices sent Exxon and other energy giants on a buying spree.  \n Exxon announced in July 2023 that it would pay $4.9 billion for Denbury Resources, an oil and gas producer that has entered the business of capturing and storing carbon and stands to benefit from changes in U.S. climate policy. Three months later it said it would spend $60 billion on shale operator Pioneer Natural Resources. That deal received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission in May. In October Chevron said it would buy Hess Corp. for $53 billion, joining the acquisitions race.  Chevron Corp. also reported its second-quarter financial results on Friday, which fell far short of profit expectations. In addition, the company said that it is moving its headquarters from San Ramon, California, to Houston, Texas. Chevron expects all corporate functions to transition to Houston over the next five years, with positions in support of its California operations remaining in San Ramon. Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth and Vice Chairman Mark Nelson will move to Houston before the end of the year. Chevron currently has about 7,000 employees in the Houston area and approximately 2,000 employees in San Ramon. The company runs crude oil fields, technical facilities, and two refineries and supplies more than 1,800 retail stations in California. Its shares slipped 1.7% before the opening bell.  Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. fell slightly in premarket trading. Chevron shares fell 1.7%."

        "body": "Russian officials on Saturday said Ukrainian forces overnight targeted multiple Russian regions with a massive drone barrage.  Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement that its air defense systems \u201cintercepted and destroyed\u201d a total of 75 drones over a number of regions that lie on the border with Ukraine or not far from it, including Belgorod, Krasnodar, Kursk, Oryol, Rostov, Voronezh, and the Ryazan region deeper inside Russia. One of those drones was also shot down over the Azov sea, the statement said.  Thirty-six drones were destroyed over the Rostov region, according to the ministry. Rostov Gov. Vasily Golubev said in an online statement, however, that the region was attacked by a total of 55 drones. He didn\u2019t specify how many of these were intercepted and how many hit the targets, saying only that \u201cwarehouse facilities\u201d in the Morozovsk and Kamensky districts sustained damage in the attack.  Ukraine\u2019s General Staff said Saturday in a Facebook post that its forces struck an airfield in Morozovsk, hitting ammunition depots with guided air bombs, as well as fuel depots in the Belgorod, Kursk and Rostov regions.  Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov confirmed that an oil depot was hit in his region. He said one of the tanks exploded and caught fire, but it was swiftly put out.  In the Oryol region, two drones crashed into a residential high-rise building, causing a brief fire, Oryol Gov. Andrei Klychkov said. One person sought medical assistance in the aftermath of the attack, he said.  \n Ukraine\u2019s Air Forces, in the meantime, said on Saturday that Russia overnight attacked Ukraine with 29 Shahed drones and four missiles.  Ukrainian air defenses shot down 24 drones over nine regions of the country, Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said in an online statement. It wasn\u2019t clear from his statement whether the missiles were intercepted as well or what damage the attack caused. "

        "body": "DOHUK, Iraq (AP) \u2014 The day they came to take her children, the young mother bundled them up against the cold. She asked her nearly 6-year-old son to take care of his younger sister. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone hit her,\u201d she told the boy. \u201cOK, Mama,\u201d she remembers him replying. Much else was left unsaid. Then, as the car carried her little boy and girl away to a life without her in a children\u2019s home in Syria, a country she knew she would soon leave, the woman wept. Nearly a decade ago, K, the mother, had been a child herself, about 13, when she and her family were captured in Iraq by militants from the Islamic State group. The extremists waged an onslaught that started in August 2014 and ravaged her Yazidi community, a small religious minority. Many were forced to flee their homes. Thousands were killed or abducted, including many women and girls subjected to sexual violence and enslavement. Ten years on, a traumatized Yazidi community is still convulsed by the legacy of IS\u2019s brutal campaign, well after the group\u2019s territorial defeat. Nearly 2,600 Yazidis are still considered missing, to the anguish of their families. Former captives grapple with the trauma of what they endured. Many have been weathering life in displacement camps. Among the most fraught questions is the fate of children who, like K\u2019s, were born to women who had been captured and raped by or married to the extremists. The Associated Press is identifying K only by her first initial due to the backlash that mothers in her sensitive situation might face. \n While the community has embraced the return of formerly kidnapped mothers like her, the children\u2019s status has proved much more contentious, colliding with long-standing Yazidi beliefs and newer scars. Many vehemently reject accepting these children in the community, viewing them as the non-Yazidi offspring of men who inflicted on them unimaginable horrors and humiliations. In her dreams, K would see herself back with her family, but she said she knew she couldn\u2019t have both: her family and children. Then came the moment when she was found living in Syria\u2019s notorious al-Hol camp housing IS-linked families. \u201cMy family said they won\u2019t receive them. The Yazidi community, too, won\u2019t receive them,\u201d she said of the children. Heartbroken as she is by what the militants did to her and others, she said the children to her are simply the babies who came out of her body. \u201cThey\u2019re kids; they\u2019ve committed no sin,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re a piece of my heart.\u201d As the 10th anniversary of the IS onslaught approaches, K finds herself reeling. Her ordeal is one stark example of the very personal toll that IS crimes against Yazidis, which a United Nations team characterized as genocide, continue to exact on many lives.  \u201cA lot of our problems are still pending, like missing people, mass graves, justice, reconciliation, return, everything,\u201d said Natia Navrouzov, executive director of Yazda, an NGO supporting the Yazidi community. \u201cWe\u2019re facing existential threats, and at the same time we\u2019re not equipped because of the trauma, the division and the lack of unity to find any way forward.\u201d In the case of children like K\u2019s, the challenges are multifaceted. Under long-standing beliefs, community members must have two Yazidi parents. Even if the community accepted the children, Iraqi laws would require them to be registered as Muslim, said Hadi Babasheikh, whose now-deceased brother was the Yazidi spiritual leader during IS atrocities. He questioned how a family can raise children whose father may have killed some of its own. Navrouzov agreed these cases were complex and said the community needs help to find a resolution: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to approach this issue without harming the mother, harming the child, harming the community.\u201d Families who accept these children might be ostracized, she added. The result: Some missing Yazidi women don\u2019t return, staying behind with IS-linked families to avoid being separated from their children, Navrouzov said. Hussein al Qaidi, director of an office tasked with rescuing kidnapped Yazidis, said many of those missing are believed to be in Syria, especially in al-Hol, and suggested they could be hiding their Yazidi identity for fear of what IS supporters in the camp would do to them. Hadi Babasheikh noted that his brother had urged the community to welcome back the formerly captured survivors \u2014 a position that was considered relatively progressive given stigma surrounding rapes and forced conversions. But he said it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d for a mother to stay in Iraq with children from IS-affiliated fathers and urges the international community to resettle those who want to keep their children. Some Yazidi mothers, he added, want nothing to do with children from IS-affiliated fathers. But for those yearning for their children, the options are tormenting. \u201cOn the one hand, I want my family and on the other, I keep thinking about my children,\u201d K said. Back in Iraq for her family reunion, K was embraced by greeters. Jubilant clapping and celebratory ululations intermingled with sobs of relief. Despite sadness for leaving her children, \u201cIt felt good ... to see my family and my people,\u201d she said. But the community she returned to is not the one of her childhood. Many Yazidis have scattered around the world; more are desperate to leave. Some have been orphaned; others don\u2019t know the fate of loved ones. Saeed Talal\u2019s missing relatives include a daughter, brothers and nephews. He and others have given blood samples and wait to hear if remains in mass graves are a match. Talal figured older male relatives must have perished but holds out hope for others. \u201cMy mind is never at ease,\u201d he said. \u201cSince 2014, I can hardly say that I\u2019ve had a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d According to Talal, after he was captured, militants gave him and men in his group an ultimatum: Convert to Islam or be killed. He converted. While his life was spared, he had to exist under IS rules. Some of his children were separated from him and their mother. At one point, he was reunited with one of his daughters and had to disguise her as a boy, fearing that the militants would marry her off like they did an older daughter. That daughter remains missing. In 2015, Talal, his wife, two sons and two other daughters escaped.  Some of the long-missing return estranged from all they were and knew; relations with families can be strained. Cheman Rasheed, director of Jinda NGO, said some come back \u201cbrainwashed,\u201d and harboring \u201cterrorist and violent\u201d thoughts. She recalled a teenager brought by his Yazidi mother for rehabilitation several years ago. The boy, Rasheed said, initially wanted to return to the militants, who had captured him earlier, and he considered his mom an infidel. According to Rasheed, he had taken part in violence while in IS hands. \u201cI can\u2019t forget the stories I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Rasheed said. \u201cSo, how is it for those who\u2019ve lived through them?\u201d The young mother, too, had changed. The familiar pieces of K\u2019s previous life faded away during an adolescence and young adulthood spent in an IS-dominated world. The militants separated her from family members. She had to trade her Kurdish dialect for Arabic. For years, she\u2019s lived under a different name. Gradually, she started praying and fasting without being told to. She became so used to being swathed in the IS-required garb for women \u2014 black robes, gloves and a face covering \u2014 that, at first, she felt virtually naked when she changed into other clothes. She had been robbed of her childhood. \u201cThey raped us and sold us off and deprived us of our families when we were kids. They\u2019ve slaughtered our men,\u201d she said, her words coming in like rapid fire. \u201cOur lives have been wasted.\u201d The militants, she said, spared Yazidi girls and women no humiliation. \u201cWe would wash for them, cook for them. They\u2019d wake me up ... and tell me to work,\u201d she said. \u201cLife was so bitter,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was for our kids\u2019 sake that we\u2019ve endured.\u201d She recalled how she told a much older man who raped her that she \u201cwas just a child.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter. \u201cHe had a heart of stone.\u201d Her life took sharp turns during her years away from home. She was sold to a man who freed her from enslavement and, eventually, she said, ended up getting married more than once, including to the men who became her children\u2019s fathers. To her, things got slightly easier after she no longer was considered enslaved in the IS universe. But, she said, she also continued enduring the al-Hol camp\u2019s hardships rather than identify herself to authorities as a Yazidi primarily so she could stay with her children.  After she was found, K learned that there\u2019s no word about the fate of her parents and one of her sisters. For all her anguish, K\u2019s face lights up when she talks about her children; her demeanor changes; she giggles, becomes more animated. She recalls how she would kiss and hug them before going to sleep; how the children, especially her son, would ask for a bedtime story; how she would sleep between her son and daughter. She talks proudly about raising them well despite everything, teaching them to be polite, to respect her. Now, she wonders what her son and daughter are doing. Their absence stings every time she tastes foods they like (eggs and instant noodles are their favorites). She believes she can feel them too, feel them asking where she is, why she isn\u2019t with them. She recalls how after they separated, she would sniff the clothes they left behind and cry. \u201cI am so worn out,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder how we still have any soul left in us.\u201d Some, like Asimah Khedr, try to move on, to start over. Khedr married a Yazidi man she met after surviving IS captivity and returning to Iraq. She said she too had left a son behind in Syria. She was 12 when she was abducted and then, she said, gifted to a man who raped her. \u201cI understood nothing. I cried, but it got me nowhere.\u201d Eventually, he sold her to a married man in Syria, at least 55 years old. That captor later freed her from enslavement and sent her into an IS guest house. Life there was tough and so, she said, she got married to escape it. She didn\u2019t want children, but said her then-husband insisted. After Khedr wrestled free, a sister and an uncle came to Syria to see her. She said she asked about bringing her boy home, but was told \u201cthis cannot be, that Yazidis wouldn\u2019t accept.\u201d At first, she didn\u2019t return, but her heart softened for her family. She also thought about the future, wondered if her son could turn out like his father, if he would even accept her, she said. And, so, she left. Adjusting to life back was a struggle in the beginning. Gone were her parents and a few of her siblings who remain missing. When others slept, she would cry. \u201cI would think about the boy. I would think about myself, about what\u2019s happened to me, about my family, everything.\u201d She said she doesn\u2019t regret leaving her son. Sometimes though she still sees him in fleeting dreams. She wakes up with tears in her eyes. K vows to never forget her children. She swears that she won\u2019t, that she can\u2019t. \u201cNo mother should leave her children,\u201d she said. \u201cI was told there was no other solution.\u201d She yearns for a life with the three of them together abroad \u2014 a life that she says they can\u2019t have in Iraq. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI only want my kids. That\u2019s it.\u201d Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "body": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz will meet for the men\u2019s tennis singles gold medal at the Paris Olympics on Sunday in the latest installment of a fascinating old-vs.-young rivalry that included a matchup in the Wimbledon final three weeks ago. Alcaraz won that one \u2014 \u201cQuite comfortably,\u201d Djokovic acknowledged \u2014 just like he did when they played each other for last year\u2019s trophy at the All England Club. When Alcaraz\u2019s semifinal in Paris ended Friday afternoon \u2014 before Djokovic played in his later semifinal that night \u2014 the 21-year-old Spaniard was asked what it might be like to possibly take on the 37-year-old Serbian again. \u201cHopefully,\u201d Alcaraz said with a chuckle, \u201cthe same as Wimbledon.\u201d Here is what else to know about the men\u2019s tennis singles final: Djokovic is the oldest man in an Olympic tennis singles final; Alcaraz is the youngest. Djokovic is considered by many to be the greatest men\u2019s tennis player in history, a stance bolstered by statistics such as his 24 Grand Slam titles (more than any other man) and his 400-plus weeks spent at No. 1 in the rankings (more than any man or woman). There is basically just one thing missing from his resume: an Olympic gold. Before beating Lorenzo Musetti in Paris on Friday, Djokovic had been 0-3 in Summer Games semifinals, losing to the eventual champion each time \u2014 Rafael Nadal in Beijing, Andy Murray in London, Alexander Zverev in Tokyo. \n Djokovic left the 2008 Olympics with a bronze, but he really wanted to improve on that now. \u201cI know,\u201d Musetti said, \u201chow much it means for (him) to win a gold.\u201d Alcaraz is the best thing going right now in the sport, having added his recent Wimbledon triumph to the one that came in June at the French Open, which is contested annually at Roland Garros, the clay-court facility being used for the Paris Games\u2019 tennis competition. Paris Olympics In 2022, he became the first teenager to reach No. 1 in the ATP rankings and now has four Grand Slam titles \u2014 the first man to win at least one on clay, grass and hard courts before age 22. \u201cAlcaraz has proven the best player in the world at the moment,\u201d said Djokovic, who was seeded No. 1 at the Olympics after top-ranked Jannik Sinner withdrew because of tonsillitis. Alcaraz was seeded No. 2, but other players tend to agree with Djokovic\u2019s assessment. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that, right now,\u201d said American Tommy Paul, who lost to the Spanish star in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the Olympics, \u201cAlcaraz is kind of like the golden standard.\u201d Djokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a fourth-round victory at the French Open on June 3, then had surgery in Paris two days later. Most people figured he would need to skip Wimbledon, which started on July 1, and the Olympics. Nope. He showed up at the All England Club, wearing a gray sleeve on his right knee, and while it took him a few matches to get going, eventually Djokovic looked very much like himself. Until, that is, he took on Alcaraz for the title. At the Summer Games, there was only one match where the knee was an issue \u2014 when he felt pain in the second set of a victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals Thursday night. But he put in plenty of work with his physiotherapist between then and his match against Musetti, when all was OK. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a different player than I was in Wimbledon. The way I move. The way I\u2019m striking the ball,\u201d said Djokovic, who eliminated Nadal in the second round in Paris. \u201cI feel more confident about myself and chances in the final\u201d on Sunday, he said.  Alcaraz is favored to win the men\u2019s singles final, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, which lists him with a -250 money line. Djokovic is at +195. If Djokovic manages to win in straight sets, that would pay off at +360. \u201cThe way he\u2019s playing,\u201d Djokovic said, \u201che\u2019s definitely a favorite.\u201d The men\u2019s final is scheduled to be the second match at Court Philippe Chatrier on Sunday and won\u2019t start before 2 p.m. local time (8 a.m. EDT). To find the right channel, check NBC\u2019s online schedule. They have met a total of six times previously and each man has won three of those matches. The only time they played at Court Philippe Chatrier was in the 2023 French Open semifinals. Djokovic won that one 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 when Alcaraz succumbed to full-body cramps during the last two sets. AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Carrie Underwood will be the next singer to sit behind the judges\u2019 table on \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d filling Katy Perry\u2019s spot after her departure from the show in May.  Underwood, who rose to fame after she won the singing competition show in 2005, will return 20 years later as a judge for the upcoming season, set to premiere in spring 2025. She\u2019s the first \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d alum to become a judge.  In an emotional video announcing Underwood\u2019s new hosting gig, she said \u201cI\u2019m proud of everything that I was able to accomplish on the show, and I\u2019m so proud of everything that I\u2019ve accomplished since.\u201d The country singer, who is the most decorated artist in CMT Music Awards\u2019 history with 25 wins, made waves with her rendition of Bonnie Raitt\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Make You Love Me\u201d at her audition, and she quickly became a fan-favorite.  Underwood has also won eight Grammy Awards and consistently tops the charts with her albums and singles. She will be joining Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie, who each have seven seasons of judging experience under their belts, for the franchise\u2019s 23rd season.  \u201cThis upcoming season marks 20 years since Carrie won America\u2019s hearts on \u2018Idol\u2019 and launched her successful multi-Grammy Award-winning career. As a former Idol and dynamic musical force, she brings a remarkably unique perspective to one of the most popular shows on television,\u201d said Craig Erwich, president of Disney Television Group, in a release from ABC. \u201cThis is a full-circle moment both for the show and audiences at home who have been tuning in for over two decades. Welcome home, Carrie.\u201d Longtime host Ryan Seacrest, who has been with the show since it premiered, will also return. Seacrest is also taking over Pat Sajak\u2019s role as the host of \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d this fall.  \n Auditions for the new season will kick off Aug. 12 with the \u201cIdol Across America\u201d nationwide search for talent and will end in September. The season is set to premiere in the spring and will be available to watch on ABC and Hulu.  \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d premiered in 2002 on Fox and was a hit for the network, but it was canceled in 2016. After two years off the air, the show was revived by ABC and has aired there for seven seasons. Perry was the first of the revival judges to leave the judges\u2019 post. A representative for Underwood did not immediately return requests for comment."

It is the second career no-hitter for Galvin. 1910 \u2014 Jack Coombs of the Philadelphia A\u2019s and Ed Walsh of the Chicago White Sox hooked up in a 16-inning scoreless tie. Coombs struck out 18 and allowed three hits. 1945 \u2014 Bill Salkeld of Pittsburgh hit for the cycle in a 6-5 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. The Pirate catcher went 5 for 5 and drove in all five runs. 1945 \u2014 Boston\u2019s Tom McBride became the third player to drive in six runs in an inning as the Red Sox pounded Washington 15-4. McBride had a bases-loaded double and triple during the Red Sox\u2019s 12-run fourth inning. 1953 \u2014 New York\u2019s Vic Raschi set a record for a pitcher by driving in seven runs in a 15-0 win over the Detroit Tigers. 1963 \u2014 New York\u2019s Mickey Mantle, batting for the first time in two months after breaking his left foot, hit a pinch home run as the Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 11-10 for a split of a doubleheader. 1973 \u2014 John Briggs of the Milwaukee Brewers went 6-for-6 in a 9-4 win over the Cleveland Indians. 1979 \u2014 Atlanta knuckleballer Phil Niekro set modern major league records with four wild pitches in one inning (fifth) and six in one game. The Braves lost to Houston 6-2. 1982 \u2014 Joel Youngblood became the first player in major league history to play and get a base hit for two different teams in two different cities in the same day. In the afternoon, his hit drove in the winning run for the New York Mets in a 7-4 victory at Chicago. After the game, he was traded to the Montreal Expos and played that night in Philadelphia. He entered the game in right field in the fourth inning and later got a single. \n 1985 \u2014 Tom Seaver, 40, became the 17th 300-game winner in major league history with a six-hitter \u2014 all singles \u2014 as the Chicago White Sox defeated the New York Yankees 4-1 on Phil Rizzuto Day. 1985 \u2014 Rod Carew of the California Angels got his 3,000th hit in a 6-5 win over the Minnesota Twins, his first major league team. 2006 \u2014 Chase Utley went 0-for-5 night in Philadelphia\u2019s 5-3 victory over the New York Mets, ending a 35-game hitting streak that tied him for the 10th longest in major league history and the fourth longest in National League history. 2007 \u2014 In the 2nd inning of a 3 - 2 loss to the Padres, Barry Bonds hits his 755th career home run to tie Hank Aaron for the all-time record. 2007 \u2014 Alex Rodriguez became the youngest player in major league history to hit 500 home runs with a first-inning homer in a 16-8 victory over Kansas City. 2010 \u2014 Alex Rodriguez hit his 600th home run and became the youngest player to attain the milestone.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is predicting that Democrats will keep control of the Senate in the November election and he feels \u201cexhilarated and gratified\u201d by the surge of enthusiasm with Vice President Kamala Harris atop the party\u2019s ticket. Schumer, who played a pivotal role in talking privately with President Joe Biden before the incumbent\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid, appears more optimistic than Democrats have been in confronting a tough Senate map this election defending seats in states where Republican nominee Donald Trump is popular. \u201cWe are so enthusiastic about the prospects of winning the presidency, keeping the Senate and winning the House,\u201d Schumer, D-N.Y., said in an interview with The Associated Press. He said the contrast with Republicans, especially in the aftermath of Trump questioning Harris\u2019 racial identity and his running mate JD Vance criticizing women without children, has been glaring. \u201cThe best thing Donald Trump did since he won the nomination was pick Vance \u2014 for Democrats,\u201d Schumer said of the Ohio senator. What had been a dismal outlook for Senate Democrats has shifted dramatically in the short time since Harris took hold of the party, sending a surge of enthusiasm, donors and volunteers to the Senate races. Republicans believe the Harris \u201choneymoon\u201d will soon end, bringing down the Democrats\u2019 chances to hold the Senate with it. Republicans are working to portray the likely presidential nominee as a California liberal out of touch with voters. \n \u201cIf you like San Francisco politics, you\u2019re going to love Kamala Harris,\u201d Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told the AP. Harris was San Francisco\u2019s district attorney and California\u2019s attorney general before serving in the Senate. What has been clear in the nearly two weeks since Biden\u2019s exit shook up the presidential ticket is that the down-ballot races are recalibrating, adjusting to the new political reality barely three months before the election that will determine control of the presidency and Congress. The Senate map had favored Republicans this election cycle. Democrats, with a one-seat majority, have more seats to defend, particularly in Montana, Ohio and other parts of the country where Trump is popular.  Democrats are almost certain to lose the West Virginia seat held by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who bowed out rather than face the popular Republican Jim Justice. What to know about the 2024 Election Republicans would need to pick up just one more Democratic-held seat to regain control, presuming they can retain seats where GOP incumbents are favored \u2013 in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz faces Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, and in Florida where Sen. Rick Scott faces Democratic Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former congresswoman. Daines sees ample chances for Republicans to make gains in as many as 10 states where seats are held by Democrats and races are expected to be tight, particularly in Montana and Ohio, where Sens. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown, respectively, are the most endangered Democrats. In Maryland, Republicans recruited former Gov. Larry Hogan for an open seat and he is facing Democrat Angela Alsobrooks, who is vying to become one of the few Black women to serve in the Senate. \u201cThe Democrats have to pitch a perfect game. We have to win one of them,\u201d Daines said. \u201cI like our odds.\u201d Schumer believes Senate Democrats are holding their own as they run on the policies and legislation that Biden has pushed, including investments in infrastructure and manufacturing centers, and as they face Republican challengers tied to Trump and Vance. With Harris heading the ticket, Schumer sees the chance for Democrats to capitalize on the energy and enthusiasm as \u201cpeople are knocking down the doors\u201d to volunteer for Senate campaigns. Schumer said he was not necessarily surprised by the energy surrounding Harris\u2019 ascent, but acknowledged the turn of events happened so quickly. Schumer had visited Biden privately at the president\u2019s beach home on a Saturday in mid-July after Democratic senators raised concerns in their own private meeting with the president\u2019s team following his debate performance against Trump.  Schumer said he felt obligated to talk with Biden directly and recounted that the two had a \u201cvery good meeting\u201d and hugged at the end. He praised the work they had done together with Biden in the White House. A week later, on the following Sunday, Biden had exited the race."

Al-Qaida\u2019s East Africa affiliate, al-Shabab, said through its radio station that its fighters carried out the attack. Police spokesperson Maj. Abdifatah Adan Hassan told journalists that one soldier was killed and another wounded, while the rest of the dead were civilians. Witnesses reported an explosion followed by gunfire. Lido Beach, a popular area in Mogadishu, is bustling on Friday nights as Somalis enjoy their weekend. A witness, Mohamud Moalim, told The Associated Press that he saw an attacker wearing an explosive vest moments before the man \u201cblew himself up next to the beach-view hotel.\u201d Moalim said some of his friends who were with him at the hotel were killed and others were wounded. Another witness, Abdisalam Adam, told the AP that he \u201csaw many people lying on the ground\u201d and had helped take some wounded people to the hospital. The Lido Beach area has in the past been targeted by militants allied to al-Shabab. The most recent attack last year killed nine people. In a separate attack on Saturday, state media reported that seven people died after a passenger vehicle hit a roadside bomb some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the capital. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud last year declared a \u201ctotal war\u201d on the militants as the country started taking charge of its own security.  \n Al-Shabab still controls parts of southern and central Somalia and continues to carry out attacks in Mogadishu and other areas while extorting millions of dollars a year from residents and businesses in its quest to impose an Islamic state. Friday\u2019s attack came a month after Somalia started the third phase of the drawdown of peacekeeping troops under the African Union Transition Mission. The U.N Secretary-General\u2019s Acting Special Representative for Somalia, James Swan, on Saturday expressed support and solidarity for Somalia \u201cin its efforts to ensure peace, security, and stability.\u201d He said Lido Beach is frequented by families and that \u201ctargeting this location is an abhorrent act that warrants the firmest condemnation.\u201d"

        "body": "VILLEPINTE, France (AP) \u2014 Nearly 17 months ago in New Delhi, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif was disqualified from the International Boxing Association\u2019s world championships three days after she won an early-round bout with Azalia Amineva, a previously unbeaten Russian prospect.  The disqualification meant Amineva\u2019s official record was perfect again. Live updates: Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 Olympics in Paris as Simone Biles, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and Karie Ledecky compete for gold medals.  The IBA said Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan had failed \u201cto meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.\u201d The governing body claimed the fighters had failed unspecified eligibility tests \u2014 the same tests that ignited a massive controversy about gender regulations and perceptions in sports this week as Khelif and Lin compete at the Paris Olympics.  The IBA\u2019s decision last year \u2014 and its curious timing, particularly related to Amineva\u2019s loss to Khelif \u2014 would have raised warning signs around the sports world if more people cared about amateur boxing, or even knew more about the IBA under president Umar Kremlev of Russia.  The entire boxing world has already learned to expect almost anything from the Russian-dominated governing body that was given the unprecedented punishment of being permanently banned from the Olympics last year. In fact, it hasn\u2019t run an Olympic boxing tournament since the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016.  The non-boxing world largely doesn\u2019t know, however, about the IBA\u2019s decades of troubled governance and longstanding accusations of a thorough lack of normal transparency in nearly every aspect of its dealings, particularly in recent years. Many people took the IBA\u2019s proclamations about Khelif and Lin at face value while dragging the eligibility dispute into wider clashes about gender identity. \n  The International Olympic Committee has decades of mostly bad history with the beleaguered governing body previously known for decades as AIBA, and it has exasperatedly begged non-boxing people to pay attention to the sole source of the allegations against Khelif and Lin. Taiwan\u2019s Lin Yu-ting, left, reacts after defeating Uzbekistan\u2019s Sitora Turdibekova in their women\u2019s 57 kg preliminary boxing match at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Friday, Aug. 2, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/John Locher)  \u201cThese two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA,\u201d IOC spokesman Mark Adams said this week. \u201cSuch an approach is contrary to good governance.\u201d  On Saturday, IOC President Thomas Bach said it was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d the two boxers have faced what he called hate speech in a \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d uproar.  The IOC had stuck with the previous incarnation of boxing\u2019s governing body through decades of judging scandals, bizarre leadership decisions and innumerable financial misdeeds while it presided over Olympic boxing tournaments.   Not until 2019, nearly two years after the organization elected a president with what U.S. officials call deep ties to Russian organized crime and heroin trafficking, did the IOC finally banish the perpetually troubled group.  The most powerful organization in amateur boxing for decades is now governing a reduced roster of national federations while keeping up its fight with the IOC. Nearly three dozen nations, including nearly all of the prominent Western boxing teams, have taken the extraordinary step of leaving the IBA to form World Boxing, a new governing body, in a final attempt to keep boxing in the 2028 Olympics.  AIBA\u2019s final Olympic downfall was triggered about six years ago when it elected president Gafur Rakhimov, an Uzbek businessman described by the U.S. Treasury Department as an organized crime boss. Rakhimov, who denies those allegations, finally resigned in July 2019, a month after the IOC suspended ties.  The group changed its name and elected Kremlev, a Russian boxing functionary and an acquaintance of Russian President Vladimir Putin. That only made things worse between the IBA and the sections of the international boxing community not beholden to the body\u2019s financial support, unlike many smaller boxing nations.  Kremlev introduced Russian state-controlled Gazprom as its biggest sponsor and moved much of the IBA\u2019s operations to Russia after he took over in late 2020. He also fought off a challenge to his leadership two years ago by essentially scrapping an election in highly dubious fashion.  None of this sat well with the IOC \u2014 particularly after the Olympic organization advised its governing bodies to prevent Russian athletes from competing with their flags and anthems after Putin\u2019s forces invaded Ukraine in 2022. The IBA disregarded that guidance at its world championships the following year.  The IOC permanently stripped the IBA\u2019s Olympic credentials and ran the past two Olympic boxing tournaments with a task force.  Former governing body president Wu Ching-kuo, the last to take part in an Olympics, made moderate progress in improving AIBA\u2019s reputation until his leadership group decided it would attempt to control boxing in all of its forms \u2014 including the professional game. The ill-conceived plan to use the chance for Olympic medals as a cudgel to sign fighters to pro contracts went nowhere, and Wu was eventually drummed out of AIBA himself amid severe financial woes.  But Kremlev has seized his opportunity this summer to call into question the IOC\u2019s governance over the Paris boxing tournament while stoking the wider outcry raised around Khelif and Lin.  Kremlev also has made additional allegations about the gender of both fighters without providing proof, and people across the world have accepted his word. That\u2019s unbelievably frustrating to veteran boxing executives like Boris Van Der Vorst, the Dutch businessman leading World Boxing. Van Der Vorst ran for the presidency of the IBA, only for his candidacy to be inexplicably declared invalid.  People have misidentified Khelif and Lin as men or transgender.  \u201cIt\u2019s not very respectful for the boxers who are competing here, to Chinese Taipei and Algeria, to speak about them in these terms. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to stress,\u201d Van Der Vorst told The Associated Press.  So much is unclear about the IBA\u2019s decision to ban Khelif and Lin last year, particularly since both had competed in IBA events for years without problems.  It\u2019s even possible the decision was actually made according to the results of legitimate tests conducted over two years, as the IBA says \u2014 but the IBA has refused to officially say what, when or where these tests were administered, who evaluated them, or what the results meant.  The national boxing federations of Algeria and Chinese Taipei are still members of the IBA, which is making a last-ditch appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal against its Olympic banishment.  The IOC has said boxing will be dropped from the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics unless the sport lines up behind a new governing body, and World Boxing is the only obvious alternative.  Until then, Kremlev isn\u2019t attempting to make nice with the IOC. He announced plans last month to pay more than $3.1 million to Olympic medalists and coaches, even though IBA has no connection to many of the nations that will win in Paris.  This week, he released a series of English-subtitled videos on social media packed with insults, saying the Olympics \u201cburns from pure devilry\u201d and calling Bach \u201cevil\u201d and urging him to \u201cresign urgently.\u201d Kremlev has ended some of them by saying he\u2019s sending Bach diapers so he doesn\u2019t soil himself, then punching the camera.

Also among the streaming offerings worth your time as selected by The Associated Press\u2019 entertainment journalists: L\u00e9a Seydoux and George MacKay lead the intriguing French sci-fi \u201cThe Beast,\u201d a World of Goo sequel video game oozes onscreen and a new HBO documentary lets Elizabeth Taylor tell her story by relying on 40 hours of recently discovered audio. \u2014 Just in time for Olympics fever, Luca Guadagnino \u2019s sweaty, synthy \u201c Challengers \u201d made its streaming debut on MGM+ on Monday. Even if you missed it in theaters, it\u2019d be hard not to be at least aware of it, what with the teasing photo of Zendaya, Mike Faist and Josh O\u2019Connor perched suggestively on that bed and the ubiquitous \u201cI TOLD YA\u201d T-shirt in paparazzi photos. For the few uninitiated, \u201cChallengers\u201d is set in the world of competitive tennis, where all three are rising stars until an injury forces Zendaya\u2019s character off the court. I wrote in my review that it\u2019s \u201ca prickly treat, about fractured relationships, egos, infidelity and ambition\u201d with \u201cplenty of skin, sweat, close-ups of muscly thighs and smoldering looks of lust and hate in this deliriously over-the-top psychodrama.\u201d The Associated Press named it one of the best movies of 2024 thus far.  \u2014 \u201c Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes \" also arrives on Hulu on Friday. Set generations after the death of Andy Serkis\u2019s Caesar (though he looms large as a figure), the smart apes are now running society and humans are the primitive ones. This installment introduces a young ape, Noa, played by Owen Teague, whose peaceful village is attacked by some bad actors who have twisted Caesar\u2019s legacy. Mark Kennedy wrote in his three-and-a-half-star review for The Associated Press that \u201cthis franchise has somehow found new vibrancy,\u201d and that \u201cdirector Wes Ball nicely handles all the thrilling sequences \u2014 though the two-and-a-half hour runtime is somewhat taxing.\u201d All nine of the prior films in the franchise are currently available on Hulu as well. \u2014 L\u00e9a Seydoux and George MacKay (\u201c1917\u201d) lead the intriguing French sci-fi \u201cThe Beast,\u201d loosely based on the Henry James story \u201cThe Beast in the Jungle.\u201d The time-jumping story has Seydoux, as Gabrielle, leading three different lives in three different time frames (1910 Paris, 2014 Los Angeles and a 2044 in which the world is being run by artificial intelligence and humans desperate for a leg up try to purify their DNA). The film, which has shades of horror and romance, was written and directed by Bertrand Bonello, and will is now streaming on the Criterion Channel. \n \u2014 AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr \u2014 On his third full-length album, \u201cStampede,\u201d the masked cowboy Orville Peck tries his hand at the great country tradition of duet albums.

The premise is the same: Viscous black sludge is streaming onto the landscape, but you can shape it into bridges, towers and other structures to guide it toward its goal. The developers, a tiny studio called 2D Boy, promise that the follow-up is just as puzzling, unpredictable and squishy as the original.

        "body": "With fewer than 100 days until the 2024 election, social media users are claiming that a lack of Google autocomplete results about former President Donald Trump and his attempted assassination is evidence of election interference. Many posts include screenshots showing what the autocomplete feature, which predicts what users are trying to type, has generated for text such as \u201cattempted assassination of tr\u201d or \u201cpresident donald.\u201d Among the pictured results for the former phrase are references to other assassination attempts, including that of Harry Truman and Gerald Ford, but nothing for Trump. The latter provides two options \u2014 \u201cpresident donald duck\u201d and \u201cpresident donald regan.\u201d Multiple high-profile figures, including Trump and sitting members of Congress, promoted the claim across social media platforms, collectively amassing more than 1 million likes and shares by Tuesday. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google attributed the situation to existing protections against autocomplete predictions associated with political violence, noting that \u201cno manual action was taken\u201d to suppress information about Trump.  Search engine experts said there are many reasons that could explain why some autocomplete results concerning the former president were not appearing. Here\u2019s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: Google is engaging in election interference by censoring autocomplete results about former President Donald Trump, including the assassination attempt at his Pennsylvania rally on July 13. \n THE FACTS: It is true that Google\u2019s autocomplete feature as of Monday was not finishing certain phrases related to Trump and the assassination attempt as shown in screenshots spreading online, but there is no evidence it was related to election interference. By Tuesday, some of the same terms were providing relevant autocomplete results. The text \u201cpresident donald\u201d now also suggests \u201cDonald Trump\u201d as a search option. Similarly, the phrase \u201cattempted assassination of\u201d includes Trump\u2019s name in autocomplete predictions. Adding \u201ctr\u201d to the same phrase though makes the option disappear. Completed searches about Trump and the assassination attempt done on both Monday and Tuesday yielded extensive relevant results regardless of what autocomplete predictions came up. Google told the AP that its autocomplete feature has automated protections regarding violent topics, including for searches about theoretical assassination attempts. The company further explained that its systems were out of date even prior to July 13, meaning that the protections already in place couldn\u2019t take into account that an actual assassination attempt had occurred. Additional autocomplete results now appearing about Trump are the result of systemic improvements \u2014 rather than targeted manual fixes \u2014 that will affect many other topics, according to the company. \u201cWe\u2019re rolling out improvements to our Autocomplete systems to show more up-to-date predictions,\u201d Google told The Associated Press in a statement. \u201cThe issues are beginning to resolve, and we\u2019ll continue to make improvements as needed. As always, predictions change over time and there may be some imperfections. Autocomplete helps save people time, but they can always search for whatever they want, and we will continue to connect them with helpful information.\u201d Search engine experts told the AP that they don\u2019t see evidence of suspicious activities on Google\u2019s part and that there are plenty of other reasons to explain why there have been a lack of autocomplete predictions about Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s very plausible that there\u2019s nothing nefarious here, that it\u2019s other systems that are set up for neutral or good purposes that are causing these query suggestions to not show up,\u201d said Michael Ekstrand, an assistant professor at Drexel University who studies AI-powered information access systems. \u201cI don\u2019t have a reason not to believe Google\u2019s claim that this is just normal systems for other purposes, particularly around political violence.\u201d Thorsten Joachims, a professor at Cornell University who researches machine learning for search engines, explained that autocomplete tools typically work by looking at queries people make frequently over a certain period of time, providing the most frequent completions of those queries. Beyond that, a search engine may automatically prune predictions based on concerns such as safety and privacy. This means that it\u2019s plausible that Google\u2019s autocomplete feature wouldn\u2019t have accounted for recent searches about the assassination attempt on Trump, especially if its systems indeed had not been updated since before the shooting. \u201cDepending on how big the window is that they\u2019re averaging over, that may simply not be a frequent query,\u201d Joachims said. \u201cAnd it may not be a candidate for autocompletion.\u201d He added that it\u2019s typical not to update a search model on a daily basis, given the costs and technical risks involved. A 2020 Google blog post about its autocomplete feature describes how the system reflects previous searches and why users might not see certain predictions, including those that are violent in nature. The post also explains that predictions may vary based on variables such as a user\u2019s location, the language they speak or rising interest in a topic. Both Ekstrand and Joachims agreed that proving bias in a complex system like Google\u2019s search engine from the outside would be extremely difficult. It would require much more data than just a couple of searches, for example, and would risk setting off the company\u2019s protections against data scraping, reverse engineering and fraud. \u201cIn general, claims that platforms are taking particular targeted actions against specific people on political bases are hard to substantiate,\u201d Ekstrand said. \u201cThey sometimes, I\u2019m sure, happen, but there\u2019s so many other explanations that it\u2019s difficult to substantiate such claims.\u201d Joachims noted that the demographics of Google\u2019s user base could impact the results of such a study if they skewed toward one side of the political aisle or another and therefore searched more for their preferred candidates. In other words, the way the system works would make it difficult to probe the system. Technical issues aside, limiting autocomplete predictions as a method of political influence could simply be bad for business. \u201cEven if Google would like to do that, I think it would be a very bad decision because they could lose a lot of users,\u201d said Ricardo Baeza-Yates, a professor at Northeastern University whose research includes web search and information retrieval.

After an almost totally rain-free year on the Italian island, fountains inside Agrigento\u2019s famous archaeological park are still flowing, and pools in rows of hotels are full. Like many Mediterranean islands, people in Sicily are used to long spells without rain, but human-caused climate change has made weather more erratic, and droughts can be longer and more frequent. Islanders are surviving as they have for decades \u2013 they store as much as they can in cisterns and use tankers to deliver water \u2013 and do it so well visitors that don\u2019t feel the difference. But this year, the drought has gotten so bad that it\u2019s putting residents at even greater risk, even as water still flows to hotels and tourist sites.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) The drought is punishing. The local water basin authority has tightly rationed water for almost a million residents \u2013 they are allowed as little as two to four hours a week \u2014 to get through the summer. And on Friday, the first Italian navy tanker ship arrived to supply 12 million liters (3.2 million gallons) of water to the most affected residents. But Agrigento residents are among the most drought-resilient in Italy, and even with rationing, they still run their businesses, hotels, bed-and-breakfasts, and households without missing a shower, neglecting their garden or closing the swimming pool. \u201cNobody can cope with water shortage better than southern Sicilians,\u201d said Salvatore Cocina, head of the local civil protection, who has the hard task of coordinating what little water is left on the island.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) \n Water scarcity is not new as southern Sicily\u2019s terrain does not hold much water and the aqueducts are leaking. The region is also prone to dry spells, particularly in the summer. Most residents own a private cistern that can hold at least a thousand liters (264 gallons) of water. The city\u2019s rooftops are dotted with large plastic tanks, and just as many are underground in gardens and basements. Despite the water emergency, tourists continue to flock to the beautiful beaches of southern Sicily and line up to admire the vestiges of ancient Greek colonies.

But he added that he was \u201ctold to conserve water because there could be a shortage.\u201d Gianluca, an Italian tourist from Lodi who didn\u2019t give his last name, said \u201cthere are no problems with drought\u201d in his experience and \u201cat my hotel, they told me they have their own reserves, their cisterns.\u201d The Valley of Temples archaeological site, which its director said drew in over a million visitors last year, has also been prioritized, so doesn\u2019t suffer from water scarcity. \u201cWe have water 24/7,\u201d explained director Roberto Sciarratta. \u201cOur archaeologists are at work, the valley is open also at night with theater plays.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) Meanwhile, water-scarce residents\u2019 tactics are working reasonably well for now, but they have been facing exceptionally difficult circumstances. 2024 has been the worst year for rainfall in more than 20 years according to the civil protection regional department. Lake Fanaco, which supplies water to Agrigento province, used to collect up to 18 million cubic meters of water during an average rainy season, which normally runs from September to April. But by April the lake\u2019s water was already below 2 million cubic meters and is now almost completely dry. In May, the national government declared a state of emergency for drought and allocated 20 million euros ($21.7 million) to buy water tankers and dig new wells. And temperatures in southern Sicily are currently 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1991-2020 average, according to the Climate Shift Index, meaning water is quick to evaporate. \u201cIf it does not rain in September, we will have to start tapping critical reserves, and wells and aquifers will also go below critical levels, not just our lakes,\u201d said Cocina.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) Everyone asks him for water. Everyone wants to make sure they will not run out of water. Everyone wants to have full cisterns. And tankers are the best way to deliver the precious water directly to residents without leaks. Dozens of tanker drivers speed along the winding roads delivering water to priority areas as determined by the local water company, AICA. Higher priority groups are sick or elderly people, hospitals, and several key businesses, such as hotels. \u201cThe drought emergency was a wakeup call,\u201d explained Settimio Cantone, president of AICA. \u201cOur aqueduct leaks 50 to 60 percent of its water.\u201d \u201cWe are now digging new wells, fixing the entire waterworks and reactivating a desalination plant with the emergency funds. This will make our province more independent,\u201d he said. \u201cSicily is so vulnerable due to leaky pipes and obsolete and undersized infrastructures. It is not just climate,\u201d said Giulio Boccaletti, scientific director of Euro-Mediterranean center on climate change. In between visits from water tankers, several Agrigento residents make frequent trips to the only public fountain left open in town to fill their jerrycans on the way home. Nuccio Navarra is one of those residents, filling up jerrycans from the Bonamorone fountain two or three times a day. \u201cIn my house we receive water every 15 days and the pressure is very low, and those who live on the upper floors cannot fill the cisterns,\u201d he said. Climate scientist Boccaletti fears for the future, although he noted that fixing water infrastructure and investing to adapt agriculture and engineering as AICA hopes to do could offset some concerns.

        "body": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 The statement that upended Venezuela came 24 hours after polls closed in the presidential election. With the reassuring tone of someone who has consistently been considered an underdog, opposition powerhouse Maria Corina Machado announced that her coalition had gathered more than two-thirds of vote tally sheets from polling centers nationwide, and that they show President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had lost his reelection bid. The tally sheets known as actas \u2014 printouts measuring several feet that resemble shopping receipts \u2014 have long been considered the ultimate proof of election results in Venezuela. Opposition members knew they had to obtain as many of them as possible to refute the unfavorable election outcome they expected electoral authorities to announce. Months of preparations and thousands of volunteers participated in the herculean task.  Their effort earned Maduro and his loyal National Electoral Council global condemnation, including from close regional allies, and fueled the anger of Venezuelans fed up with their nation\u2019s cascading economy. In response, the government called for opposition leaders to be arrested, capping an election season marked by repression and irregularities. This account of the opposition\u2019s effort is based on public statements, as well as interviews with party representatives, volunteers and others involved, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of government retribution. Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024 Tens of thousands of volunteers participated in training workshops nationwide in recent months. They learned that under the law they could be inside polling centers on Election Day, stationed near voting machines, from before polls opened until the results had been electronically transmitted to the National Electoral Council in the capital, Caracas. \n Organizational discipline was key to their success because the ruling party wields tight control over the voting system. Polling places are guarded by soldiers, civilian militia, police and loyalists of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela. On Sunday, officials attempted to block opposition volunteers from voting centers, and in some places, they succeeded. But elsewhere, the volunteers were unshakable, and once inside voting centers, they did not leave, in some cases until after 11 p.m.  \u201cThey took courage with their law in hand, with the polling station manual in hand, and they managed to enter,\u201d Machado said Sunday, before the polls closed. She called party representatives and other volunteers \u201cthe heroes of this process.\u201d The 90,000 party representatives were taught to obtain a copy of the tally sheets \u2014 printed from electronic voting machines after polls close \u2014 before the results were transmitted to the council.  \u201cOur representatives have the right to their tally sheet,\u201d Machado said. \u201cNo representative leaves their voting center without the document in hand.\u201d The volunteers were also trained to use a custom-made app to report voting center irregularities such as opening delays or power outages, and to scan a QR code printed on every tally sheet. Venezuelans have used electronic voting machines for about two decades. The machines record votes, provide a paper receipt for each voter and \u2014 after polls close \u2014 print copies of the tally sheets, whose length has led to the nickname, \u201cchorizo,\u201d or \u201csausage\u2019 in Spanish.  The tallies show vote totals broken down by candidate, the QR code and the signatures of party representatives, an employee of the electoral body and poll workers who are drawn by lot to participate. Every party representative is entitled to a tally sheet, while another copy is placed in an envelope and delivered to the National Electoral Council headquarters. Infighting and disorganization had consistently limited the ability of government opponents to secure and safeguard the tallies in previous elections. But Machado said the opposition had obtained more than 70% of sheets. That number would eventually grow to over 80%. The QR code scans gave a team of campaign workers immediate access to voting results, which they tabulated Sunday night and Monday. The National Electoral Council has not yet shared the tallies on its website, which has been down since Monday. While it is not obligated to post images of the tally sheets, it has previously shared each sheet\u2019s totals.  The council on Monday reported that Maduro received 5.1 million votes, while Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, representing the Unitary Platform opposition coalition, earned more than 4.4 million. Council President Elvis Amoroso on Friday provided updated results from 96.87% of tally sheets, gave Maduro 6.4 million votes and Gonzalez 5.3 million. Eight other men vied for the presidency, including Enrique M\u00e1rquez, a former member of the electoral council, who decried the official results and lambasted authorities for the lack of transparency. \u201cMost of our witnesses \u2026 were prevented from accessing the voting centers,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThose who were able to enter witnessed the process and waited for the tally sheets, but they were not given to them as required by law and its regulations. Not only does it violate the law, it generates obscurity, opacity, lack of transparency.\u201d The opposition, electoral experts and foreign governments questioning the official results, including President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Gustavo Petro of Colombia, both Maduro allies, who have urged him to make the sheets public.  Securing the \u201cchorizo\u201d from each of the 30,000 voting machines was only half the battle. The campaign needed to get them all fully scanned using equipment especially designed to copy the tally sheets.  That\u2019s when yet more volunteers came into play. If the party representatives did not feel safe or were unable to reach the places where the scanners were housed, volunteers met the representatives, grabbed the sheets and transported them via motorcycle, car, bike and even boat to the appropriate locations. By the time National Electoral Council President Elvis Amoroso was shown on television handing Maduro a document certifying his victory, the opposition had scanned more than half of the tally sheets. Hours later, Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez stood before reporters and announced the numbers that shook the country: The vote tallies show Gonz\u00e1lez received roughly 6.2 million votes versus Maduro\u2019s 2.7 million. The scanned tallies were also uploaded to a searchable website, and anyone who voted could use their government identification number to check out the tally sheet belonging to the machine they used to vote.  The government then claimed that the electoral council\u2019s website had been hacked. National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez insisted Maduro was the indisputable winner and called his opponents violent fascists. He called for Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez to be arrested. Maduro has faced a cascade of criticism ever since. International observers say they were unable to verify the results. Regional allies urged the government to publish the complete vote tallies. On Thursday, the U.S. government congratulated Gonz\u00e1lez on his victory. \u201cAt least 12 million Venezuelans peacefully went to the polls and exercised one of the most powerful rights given to people in any democracy: the right to vote,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the processing of those votes and the announcement of results by the Maduro-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) were deeply flawed, yielding an announced outcome that does not represent the will of the Venezuelan people.\u201d "

        "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 The 1975 is being sued after Matty Healy\u2019s kiss of a bandmate in an on-stage protest shut down a music festival last year in Malaysia.  Healy used profanities as he criticized Malaysia\u2019s stance against homosexuality before kissing bassist Ross MacDonald during the band\u2019s headline performance at the Good Vibes Festival in Kuala Lumpur. Homosexuality is a crime in Malaysia, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning.  The lawsuit from the festival organizer Future Sound Asia seeks 1.9 million pounds ($2.5 million) for breach of contract and losses. It filed the lawsuit against The 1975 Productions LLP and all four of the band members in the High Court in London on July 23, lawyer David Dinesh Mathew said Thursday. The government slammed Healy\u2019s conduct, blacklisted the band from the country and canceled the three-day festival. Some in the LGBTQ+ community also criticized the band, saying Healy had disrupted the work of activists pushing for change and had endangered the community. In its lawsuit, FSA said the band previously performed at the festival in 2016 and had been reminded that performance rules included no swearing, smoking, drinking alcohol, talking about politics and religion, or indecent action such as kissing. Malaysian authorities initially refused to let the band perform amid reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and his subsequent recovery but relented after the band promised Healy would adhere to all guidelines and regulations, FSA said. \n The band\u2019s fee for its one-hour show was $350,000, of which the bulk was paid, but their conduct was a \u201cclear and deliberate breach\u201d of their contract, FSA said. Representatives for The 1975 did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. The lawsuit came after attempts to claim compensation from the band last year failed. Mathew said the defendants are expected to file their defense in September. The band canceled shows in Taiwan and Indonesia last year after the fiasco in the Malaysian capital."

        "body": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 Some of the world\u2019s best beach volleyball is coming from places better known for snow than for sand. Norway, the defending Olympic gold medalist, is undefeated through pool play at the Summer Games. Sweden arrived in Paris with an innovative jump-set that helped it climb to the top of the international rankings. And as the Paris Games move into the knockout round, the teams no one wants to play aren\u2019t from traditional beach volleyball powers like the United States and Brazil but rather from Scandinavia. \u201cWhen we watched beach volleyball when we were growing up, it was USA, Brazil, our Aussie boys,\u201d Mark Nicolaidis of Australia said after losing the opening match to the Swedes. \u201cNow every country has got teams. \u201cAnyone can beat anyone on any day. You just can\u2019t come out, underestimate anyone at all. There\u2019s not really one nation that absolutely dominates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone on their own day.\u201d Beach volleyball traces its roots to Hawaii, and the two-person format that has been played in the Olympics since 1996 was born on the Southern California coast. At Brazilian beaches like Copacabana and Ipanema, the sport became a national pastime. So it\u2019s no surprise that the United States and Brazil have ruled the sands at the Summer Games, winning seven of the first eight medals. (Australia took the women\u2019s gold in Sydney.) On the women\u2019s side, the U.S., Brazil and Australia swept the medals in every Olympics through 2012 except Beijing, where China won silver and bronze. \n The dominance was so complete that when the Germans swept the golds in London, Laura Ludwig had to ask three-time Olympic champion Kerri Walsh Jennings where to go for the medal ceremony. \u201cBefore it was maybe Brazil and U.S. dominating. Now those American teams are getting a lot of competition from the Europeans,\u201d said Anders Mol of Norway, who along with Christian Sorum is attempting to become the first men\u2019s pair to repeat as Olympic champion. Paris Olympics \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s great for the sport, and for the development, to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThe level has never been higher, worldwide.\u201d In Tokyo, in fact, there were no Americans or Brazilians in the men\u2019s final four, a first; instead, Russia won silver and Qatar took bronze, with Latvia losing in the third-place match. (Americans April Ross and Alix Klineman won the women\u2019s gold, but it was the lone U.S. medal for the second straight Olympics.) And that\u2019s no accident. The International Volleyball Federation has invested more than $35 million on an empowerment program to bring the sport to countries with little beach \u2014 or even indoor volleyball \u2014 tradition. A continental qualifier system helps round out the Olympic field in a more representative way, opening the door to Paris for teams from Morocco, Egypt and Japan. (Olympic country quotas have long prevented any nation from grabbing more than two spots in the men\u2019s or women\u2019s field.) And the FIVB says it is working. There are men\u2019s teams from 152 different countries, and 131 for the women, on the international tour \u2014 up from around 40 for the 2012 Olympic cycle, the federation said. Tournaments are hosted in 35 countries, including India, South Africa and Morocco \u2014 almost double the number from just two years ago. \u201cThe sport is growing and that\u2019s an important thing,\u201d said Esteban Grimalt of Chile. \u201cNew teams, new countries getting really good teams. It\u2019s great.\u201d Mol said the sport has a long tradition in his homeland that is just beginning to pay off on the medal stand; his mother, Merita Berntsen, played beach for Norway in the Atlanta Games, finishing tied for ninth. For countries where volleyball infrastructure is less developed, the beach side allows for a quicker ramp-up because it requires only two people, instead of a dozen for the indoor game. \u201cI think it\u2019s easier to find two great athletes than to find a whole indoor national team,\u201d Mol said. \u201cSo you just need two great athletes and really work hard with them. And I think that\u2019s what happened with us. And it\u2019s also what happened with the Swedish boys.\u201d You don\u2019t even need a beach. \u201cWe also have, like, indoor beach volleyball facilities, so you can practice even if it\u2019s snowing outside,\u201d said David Ahman of Sweden, who is paired with Jonatan Hellvig on the No. 1-ranked team in the world. \u201cI think that\u2019s really important for us in Sweden to, to be able to practice all year.\u201d Mol insists that Norway has beautiful beaches, and the FIVB international tour makes an annual stop in Stavanger. But the water temperature reaches only about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 Celsius) in August; the Norwegians have more than twice as many medals in the Winter Games as the Summer Games. So where would a Scandinavian go if he really got the urge for a beach vacation? \u201cAnywhere,\u201d Ahman said, \u201cthat\u2019s warmer than Sweden.\u201d AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"

        "body": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 Paris prosecutors said Friday that police have opened a hate speech investigation following a complaint by Olympics opening ceremony artistic director Thomas Jolly over death threats. The Paris prosecutors\u2019 office said in a statement that Jolly filed a police complaint on Tuesday, four days after the opening ceremony, for death threats, \u201cpublic insults\u201d and \u201cdefamation.\u201d Jolly said he has been \u201cthe target of threatening messages and insults on social networks criticizing his sexual orientation and his wrongly-assumed Israeli roots,\u201d the statement said. France\u2019s Central Office for Combating Crimes Against Humanity and Hate Crimes has been charged with the investigation. Jolly\u2019s complaint comes after the Paris Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage, including angry comments from Donald Trump, in the wake of a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers. Although Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d critics interpreted part of the show as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting showing Jesus Christ and his apostles.  French President Emmanuel Macron extended full support to Jolly and all performing artists who were part of the Olympics opening show.  \u201cI am outraged and sad,\u201d Macron said about threats and cyberbullying Jolly and others have suffered. \u201cNothing justifies threats against an artist,\u201d Macron said. \n \u201cFrench people were very proud of the opening ceremony that presented France\u2019s history, its adventurous spirit, its audacity and it was all done with artistic freedom, which is very important to us,\u201d Macron said.  Jolly\u2019s \u201cdaring art in the opening ceremony made many people happy,\u201d he added. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also expressed \u201cunwavering support\u201d of Jolly in the face of the threats and harassment.  With his opening ceremony, \u201cJolly held our values high,\u201d Hidalgo said in a statement Friday. \u201cIt was a pride and an honor for Paris to be able to count on his talent to magnify our city and tell the world who we are.\u201d Hidalgo added: \u201cParis will always be on the side of artists, of creation and therefore, on the side of freedom.\u201d Barbara Butch, a popular DJ and LGBTQ+ icon who performed in the show, also said she suffered a torrent of online threats. Butch has filed a complaint alleging online abuse and harassment, which police are also investigating.

Costner, in a statement, said that his \u201cdream\u201d was always to show the film at Venice. The first installment had a glitzy premiere at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Alberto Barbera, the director of the Venice Film Festival, described it as the \u201cvisionary project of a great actor and director, who invested himself in the epic reconstruction of the years crucial to the founding of the country, digging beyond myth in search of authenticity capable of restoring a piece of history in its complex and contradictory reality.\u201d The back-to-back release for both films, one in June and one in August, was unconventional.

In announcing the change of plans, New Line Cinema said they hoped to give more audiences more time to discover Chapter One.

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It is not easy to be an outsider in country music, but Orville Peck has made a career out of it. On his third album, \u201cStampede,\u201d his nonconformist spirit has led to collaborations with everyone from Willie Nelson and Elton John to Mickey Guyton and Kylie Minogue. When the South African musician released his debut album, \u201cPony,\u201d in 2019, little was known about him. A country crooner with a deep baritone more in line with outlaws like Merle Haggard and Waylon Jennings than anything on contemporary radio, Peck hid his identity (Peck is a pseudonym) and his face behind a mask. A wide strip of leather completely obscured his forehead down to the nose bridge; the rest of his visage was concealed underneath a large Stetson and a foot of cascading fringe. As his public prolife rose and he continued to release new music, Peck started slowing stripping back the mask. Now, as he prepares to release \u201cStampede,\u201d a duets album, only the hat and eye mask remain. \u201cI think it\u2019s sort of in parallel with my confidence,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I first started \u2014 my first album \u2014 I really needed the mask.\u201d It takes some self-assurance to release a duets album. Each song is a brand-new collaboration, a previously unexplored creative experiment, and a balancing act. \u201cEvery single song is me, 50%, and then 50% the other artist,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a long tradition in country to do duets and have sort of duos. You know, I think of Johnny Cash and June Carter, Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris,\u201d he says, suggesting that this kind of album would arrive later in his career.  \n \u201cBut then when Willie asked me to do (the song) \u2018Cowboys,\u2019 it was like, \u2018Oh, is this maybe the right moment?\u2019 And so, then I asked Elton, and then I asked Kylie, and then, you know, so on, so forth.\u201d  A dream get that didn\u2019t work out? Dolly Parton. In the case of Nelson, Peck is referring to the 1981 queer country cult classic, Ned Sublette\u2019s \u201cCowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other,\u201d covered by Nelson in 2006 and an infrequent staple of Peck\u2019s live show. When Nelson and Peck played a festival together a few years ago, the country legend invited Peck onto his tour bus for a cup of coffee and suggested they re-do the song as a duet. He told Peck, \u201cIt\u2019s more important now than ever,\u201d Peck recalls. \u201cI think the fact that he wanted to do this particular song with me, and the fact that his reasoning behind it was in support, and motivated in the encouragement of LGBTQ people, I mean, it\u2019s like the most validating thing ever.\u201d Later, they\u2019d film a music video for the duet at Nelson\u2019s Luck Ranch in Texas. Across \u201cStampede,\u201d too, are non-traditionalist duets and covers. There\u2019s \u201cPapa Was a Rodeo,\u201d a bluegrass cover of the Magnetic Fields\u2019 indie rock song, now with Molly Tuttle and Golden Highway. There\u2019s an ode to Sin City, \u201cDeath Valley High,\u201d with Beck, who told the AP the song was inspired by \u201cElvis in Vegas is, you know, Vegas by way of Memphis. It\u2019s a totally different thing from Sinatra Vegas.\u201d There\u2019s also \u201cMidnight Ride,\u201d a disco number with Kylie Minogue and Diplo, which the trio debuted live during a Pride event in Los Angeles in June. \u201cI\u2019ve learned over the years how important visibility is,\u201d Peck says, \u201cBringing something that\u2019s really joyful and inclusive.\u201d A kind of outsiderness is where Peck feels home. \u201cCountry radio \u2014 country with a capital C \u2014 it\u2019s sort of its own thing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou got to do a lot of kissing babies and shaking hands to kind of play the Nashville game. And it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve never been interested in doing. \u201cI just want to have my music and my art speak for itself, and I don\u2019t feel like I need to go kiss asses in Nashville to be accepted and be validated,\u201d he continued.  \u201cI know how country I am. I get to work with incredible legends like Willie Nelson, Tanya Tucker, all these people that I grew up idolizing, that love me. So, you know, that\u2019s enough validation for me. And if I\u2019m not on top 40 radio on country music, you know, that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d Writer Krysta Fauria contributed to this report from Los Angeles."

That is the biggest strategy, trusting your instincts.\u201d The finals for the men and women will be Monday. Launching off the platform is the biggest thrill for Italian men\u2019s kayaker Giovanni De Gennaro, this year\u2019s gold medalist in kayak singles on Thursday. \u201cThe best part is probably the ramp,\u201d he said. \u201cWe usually need to get our speed with our arms and our strength, but with the ramp you can use gravity to get the boost. You feel like you\u2019re sprinting immediately when you land.\u201d New Zealand men\u2019s kayaker Finn Butcher said speed is still the goal, even amid the chaos. But that everyone also has to be smart. Competitors can be disqualified for going on the wrong side of the gates. And though they can make contact with other boats, they can\u2019t hit the other competitors. \n \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of adaptation in the run,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, the best form of defense is to get out in front and be by yourself, so that\u2019s the main goal. If you end up in the melee, you need to adapt to the situation.\u201d Australia\u2019s Noemie Fox said nothing that happens on the course is to be taken personally. \u201cIf you get ganged up on or if things don\u2019t go your way,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s just the sport.\u201d Britain\u2019s Joseph Clarke, a world champion in 2023 who is ranked No. 1 in the world by the International Canoe Federation and had the fastest qualifying time on Friday, said kayak cross should draw interest. \u201cI really see this as a gateway to the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite as technical as the slalom, and I think it\u2019s going to be a really big hit on the TV.\u201d AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games"

        "body": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Investor Warren Buffett \u2018s company recorded a $47 billion gain on stock sales during the second quarter as he slashed Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s massive Apple stake, but a drop in the paper value of its remaining investments drug down earnings despite improvements in the myriad companies it owns. Selling off a big chunk of its Apple holdings was the quarter\u2019s biggest news \u2014 Buffett once called the company\u2019s stake in the iPhone maker a pillar of Berkshire\u2019s business that he intended to hold indefinitely. The other major investment moves Buffett made during the quarter included continued cuts to its investment in Chinese EV maker BYD and selling off some of its Bank of America stock. Berkshire didn\u2019t give an exact count of its Apple shares in Saturday\u2019s report, but it estimated the investment was worth $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter even though shares soared over the summer as high as $237.23. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire\u2019s Apple stake was worth $135.4 billion. Berkshire said it earned $30.348 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That\u2019s down from $35.912 billion, or $24,775 per A share, a year ago when the paper value of its investment portfolio was up $24.2 billion.  This year the value of the investments Berkshire continues to hold fell $28.2 billion. Buffett has long cautioned investors that it\u2019s better to look at Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings when judging its performance because those figures exclude investment gains and losses which can vary widely from quarter to quarter.  \n By that measure, Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings grew more than 15% to $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, from $10.043 billion, or $6,928.40 per Class A share, a year ago. Geico led the improvement of Berkshire\u2019s businesses while many of its other companies that are more sensitive to the economy reported lackluster results. The results easily topped the $6,530.25 earnings per share that four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted. Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candy."

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. economy suffered an unexpected setback in July as hiring fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month with raised interest rates taking a toll on businesses and households. Employers added just 114,000 jobs in July \u2014 35% fewer than expected \u2014 and unemployment, now at 4.3%, is the highest since October 2021, the Labor Department reported Friday.  \u201cThings are deteriorating quickly,\u2019\u2019 said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.  The sharp downturn in U.S. hiring shook financial markets around the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.8%. The sturdy U.S. economy has been a key driver of global economic growth and the U.S. jobs market has been the fuel, giving Americans the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending. The unemployment rate\u2019s jump to 4.3% in July crossed a tripwire that historically has signaled recession \u2014 though economists say the gauge probably is not reliable in the post-pandemic economy.  Hiring may have been disrupted by Hurricane Beryl, which slammed the Texas economy last month. And ZipRecruiter\u2019s Pollak noted employers have cut worker hours and made temporary layoffs \u2014 suggesting that they are optimistic a rate cut may turn things around. \u201cThey are just slowing hiring and putting people on temporary layoff, furlough,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cThey want to get back to business. They see lots of opportunities to expand. They they just need rates to be (lower).\u2019' \n The Federal Reserve said this week that in needed to see more evidence inflation is moving toward its 2% target before it cuts rates. Chair Jerome Powell characterized the American job market as healthy despite calls for the central bank to begin lowering its benchmark rate, which stands at a 23-year high. Hourly wages rose just 3.6% from July 2023, the smallest year-over-year gain since May 2021, and another sign that inflation could be heading closer to the Fed\u2019s target. July job gains were concentrated in a few industries. Healthcare and social assistance firms added 64,000 jobs last month, accounting for 56% of hiring. Restaurants, hotels and bars added nearly 26,000 jobs. Labor Department revisions, however, clipped 29,000 jobs from May-June payrolls. This year, the economy has generated nearly 203,000 jobs a month, solid but down from 251,000 last year, 377,000 in 2022 and a record 604,000 in 2021, when the job market roared back from pandemic lockdowns.  The economy is weighing heavily on voters\u2019 minds ahead of the November presidential election. Many Americans have been unimpressed after three years of strong job gains, exasperated instead by high prices. Two years after inflation hit a four-decade high, price increases have eased but consumers are still paying 19% more for goods and services than they were in spring 2021. The so-called Sahm Rule, named for the former Fed economist who came up with it, Claudia Sahm, holds that a recession is almost always already underway if the unemployment rate (based on a three-month moving average) rises by half a percentage point from its low of the past year. The jump to 4.3% unemployment crosses that threshold.  Still, Sahm, now chief economist at New Century Advisors, said before Friday\u2019s report that this time \u201ca recession is not imminent\u2019\u2019 even if the Sahm Rule were triggered. That is partly because America\u2019s jobs numbers have been upended by an unexpected surge in immigration \u2014 much of it illegal \u2014 over the past couple of years.  The new arrivals have poured into the American labor force and eased labor shortages across the economy \u2014 but not all have found jobs right away, pushing up unemployment. People who have entered the country illegally are also less inclined to respond to Labor Department surveys, meaning they may go uncounted as employed. On Wednesday, the Fed signaled that it would likely cut rates in September from its current level of 5.3%. The slowdown in hiring has spurred calls from economists and Wall Street for a half-point cut by the Fed, rather than the more traditional quarter-point. Powell downplayed that possibility Wednesday, though he did not rule it out. A break on borrowing costs could not come soon enough for many business owners.  Chris Maher is CEO OceanFirst Bank in Red Bank, New Jersey, which works with 20,000 small businesses from restaurants and hotels to car dealerships. Maher said those businesses have pulled back on hiring since Memorial Day as its customers grow more cautious.  A Fed rate cut in September could boost businesses like home construction and car dealerships by cutting the cost of loans, leading to a pickup in hiring, Maher said, but he remains cautious.  At the Barrel Room, a San Francisco wine bar and restaurant, founder Sarah Trubnick is puzzled by what\u2019s happening with the economy. After an \u201cinsanely busy\u2019\u2019 first three months of 2024, she had high hopes for the rest of the year. But business plummeted over the summer, and she doesn\u2019t know why.  She had to lay off four workers and now has 10 at the business she founded in 2011.  \u201cWe had been in business for many years,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cSo we were very familiar with the patterns, and we knew when to bring on more people, when to expect difficult times. And we knew we had to have a financial cushion at times. We had it all down to a science. And post-COVID I can\u2019t figure out the pattern.\u2019\u2019 The Labor Department reported Thursday that 1.88 million Americans were collecting unemployment benefits the week of July 20, most since November 2021 \u2013 and a sign that those without a job are likely struggling to find a new one.  Julian Cannon, 34, of New York lost his job as a reporter at a online publication back in December. He\u2019s applied for hundreds of jobs with no luck. One company interviewed him eight times for several positions, then ended up hiring a candidate who already worked there. \u201cI\u2019m still looking, and I\u2019m at a breaking point,\u2019\u2019 he said.

        "body": "VILLEPINTE, France (AP) \u2014 The banned International Boxing Association wants to give a $50,000 prize to Italy boxer Angela Carini, who tearfully quit her opening bout with Imane Khelif of Algeria at the Paris Olympics after just 46 seconds. IBA president Umar Kremlev made the announcement in his latest video in a series of incendiary criticisms of the International Olympic Committee, which suspended his organization\u2019s Olympic recognition before the Tokyo Games and banished the body from the Olympic movement entirely last year. Kremlev also said he intends to award $25,000 to Italy\u2019s national federation and $25,000 to Carini\u2019s coach after her dramatic opening-round exit against Khelif. The IBA claims Khelif failed an unspecified gender identity test last year at its world championships, and it has stoked a worldwide uproar over the presence of Khelif and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan in the Olympic women\u2019s boxing tournament. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look at her tears,\u201d Kremlev said of Carini. \u201cI am not indifferent to such situations, and I can assure that we will protect each boxer. I do not understand why they kill women\u2019s boxing. Only eligible athletes should compete in the ring for the sake of safety.\u201d The IOC repeatedly has said Khelif and Lin meet the requirements for Olympic eligibility. Both boxers competed in IBA tournaments for years before their abrupt disqualification last year in New Delhi. \n The IBA announced plans last month to give $3.1 million in prize money to the medal winners in Paris \u2014 even though the IBA has nothing to do with Olympic boxing anymore. The IOC and the IBA have clashed for years over the IOC\u2019s concerns about the IBA\u2019s governance, financial transparency and fairness. It\u2019s unclear whether Carini and the Italian Boxing Association would accept the IBA\u2019s money \u2014 or even which Italian federation the IBA hopes to reward, because it didn\u2019t specify in its news release. Paris Olympics Italy\u2019s official national federation last month joined World Boxing, the breakaway governing body attempting to keep boxing in the Olympics. World Boxing has 37 members, and it hopes to add many more before the IOC\u2019s deadline early next year for the sport to line up behind a new governing body to keep its place on the Olympic program. The IBA lists a different Italian national federation \u2014 the Federacione Pugilistica Italiana \u2014 among its members on its website. Many nations have multiple amateur boxing federations.

        "body": "Already more than a month late getting back, two NASA astronauts will remain at the International Space Station until engineers finish working on problems plaguing their Boeing capsule, officials said Thursday. Test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were supposed to visit the orbiting lab for about a week and return in mid-June, but thruster failures and helium leaks on Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule prompted NASA and Boeing to keep them up longer.  NASA\u2019s commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said mission managers are not ready to announce a return date. The goal is to bring Wilmore and Williams back aboard Starliner, he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll come home when we\u2019re ready,\u201d Stich said.  Stich acknowledged that backup options are under review. SpaceX\u2019s Dragon capsule is another means of getting NASA astronauts to and from the space station. \u201cNASA always has contingency options,\u201d he said. Engineers last week completed testing on a spare thruster in the New Mexico desert and will rip it apart to try to understand what went wrong ahead of the Starliner\u2019s docking. Five thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. It appears degraded seals are to blame for the helium leaks and thruster problems \u2014 entirely separate issues \u2014 but more analysis is needed. The team will test-fire the capsule\u2019s thrusters this weekend while docked to the space station to gather more data, said Boeing\u2019s Mark Nappi. \n Each of the 28 maneuvering thrusters can fit in a hand and weighs 2 pounds (1 kilogram). The capsule is also outfitted with bigger engines for dropping out of orbit at flight\u2019s end. All these are part of a segment that is discarded before landing, which means nothing to study for future flights. After the space shuttles retired, NASA hired private companies for astronaut rides to the space station, paying Boeing and SpaceX billions of dollars.  This was the Boeing\u2019s first test flight with a crew aboard. The initial demo in 2019, flying empty, never made it to the space station because of bad software, and Boeing repeated the test in 2022. More issues later cropped up. SpaceX has been ferrying astronauts since 2020. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets have been grounded for the past two weeks because of an upper-stage failure on a satellite-delivery mission. The longer the stand-down continues, the more likely upcoming crew flights will be delayed.

        "body": "DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) \u2014 Thousands of people protested peacefully in Bangladesh\u2019s capital Saturday to demand justice for more than 200 students and others killed during protests last month, but violence was reported at similar events elsewhere in the country. The protesters chanted anti-government slogans and demanded the resignation of the prime minister as the wave of protest widened beyond students to include people from many walks of life. Some pro-government groups also rallied in the city. The country\u2019s leading Bengali-language Prothom Alo newspaper reported that at least seven protesters were hit by bullets after pro-ruling party groups allegedly opened fire on them as they blocked a road in Cumilla, in the east of Bangladesh. The daily said at least 30 protesters were injured during the violence, but a local leader of the ruling party denied allegations that their supporters attacked the protesters.  Scores of people were injured in other parts of the country, TV stations reported.  The students\u2019 protests last month began with the demand for an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said was discriminatory. Under it, 30% of such jobs were reserved for the families of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence against Pakistan in 1971.  The protests began peacefully, but turned violent as students at Dhaka University clashed with police and the activists of a student wing of the ruling Awami League party on July 15. Since then, more than 200 people have died and thousands of others have been injured. \n The Supreme Court cut the veterans\u2019 quota to 5% on July 21, but protests have continued to spread amid outrage over the violence. Authorities closed schools and universities across the country, blocked internet access and imposed a shoot-on-sight curfew. At least, 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks. Internet service has been restored and banks and offices have reopened, but tensions remain high. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday offered to talk with student leaders, but a coordinator refused in a Facebook post. Nahid Islam, a leading protest coordinator, wrote: \u201cOne cannot ask a killer government for justice or sit for talks with them. The time to ask forgiveness has passed. When there was still time, the government conducted block raids to arrest and torture students.\u201d Hasina reiterated her pledges to thoroughly investigate the deaths and punish those responsible for the violence. She said that her doors were open for the talks and she was ready to sit down whenever the protesters want.  The protests have become a major challenge for Hasina, who returned to power for a fourth consecutive term in January in an election boycotted by her main opponents. The students had earlier made a nine-point demand, including a public apology from Hasina and release of all the students arrested and jailed. On Saturday, however, they announced they had a single demand \u2014 the resignation of Hasina and her administration. They also called for a \u201cnon-cooperation\u201d movement from Sunday and urged people not to pay taxes or utility bills and to keep factories and offices closed.  The general secretary of Hasina\u2019s ruling party said Saturday that it was calling on its supporters to demonstrate across the country on Sunday.  Hasina and other Cabinet ministers had earlier blamed the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and now-banned right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami party and its student wing for intruding into the student protests and committing violence. Both the parties have denied the allegations.  Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, said Saturday that they would continue to support the protesters in their movement. "

Daytime was so hot she was drowsy. With no air conditioning at night, she considered sleeping in her car like a friend had. \u201cI\u2019ve really noticed a very big increase in temperatures.

        "body": "CAMMARATA, Italy (AP) \u2014 On a scorching July afternoon, a municipal water truck rolls up in a cloud of dust on Liborio Mangiapane\u2019s farm in southern Sicily. Some of the precious liquid gets transferred to a smaller cistern on a tractor that Mangiapane\u2019s son will use to fill troughs for 250 cattle and sheep, but by tomorrow, all 10,000 liters from the truck will be gone. Crippling drought from a nearly rainless year, coupled with record-high temperatures, has burned out much of the region\u2019s hay and is pushing farmers to the limit. For Mangiapane, every day is a struggle to find water, with frantic phone calls, long trips to faraway wells and long waits for municipal tankers.  If rain doesn\u2019t come by the end of August, he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll have to sell off his livestock. \u201cWe are in a moment of extreme heat and therefore animals need a lot of water,\u201d Mangiapane said. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant anxiety to keep the animals from suffering, but also just to have a chance to wash ourselves.\u201d Sheep are released to graze as the sun sets and temperatures go down, at the Liborio Mangiapane farm, in Cammarata central Sicily, Italy, Thursday, July 18, 2024.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) The worst year for rainfall in more than 20 years has sent fodder production down 70% across Sicily, according to Coldiretti, Italy\u2019s primary farmers association. The main water basins are almost empty and authorities are strictly rationing water. The region is one of Italy\u2019s breadbaskets, producing 20% of the country\u2019s durum wheat that goes into pasta. Coldiretti estimated that the drought could reduce production on the island by as much as 70%, leading to greater reliance on imports. In coming months, the dry year may hit olive oil and peach production. Hot weather has caused the grape harvest to start nearly four weeks early, though that crop is so far undamaged. \n In May, the national government declared a state of emergency in Sicily and allocated 20 million euros ($21.7 million) to buy water tankers, dig new wells and fix leaky aqueducts. Coldiretti has donated 1.5 million tons of fodder and the regional government allocated subsidies for farmers forced to buy hay from third parties.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) Parts of Sicily have had rainfall deficits of up to 60%, according to the meteorology department at Italy\u2019s National Research Council. The regional meteorological service reported above-average temperatures throughout June, with highs frequently topping 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many areas. Farmers have seen basins, lakes and ponds that used to be reliable watering spots vanish.

The area has seen almost no rain for a year, reservoirs are all but empty, and wells and aquifers will have to be tapped at critical levels if it doesn\u2019t rain soon. \u201cHere in this small basin, water has never been lacking,\u201d Cammarata said, as his sheep\u2019s bells tinkled as they searched for water in the place they used to find it. Soon, the animals would have to return to their barns to avoid the blazing sun.

Now it looks like a puddle. The story was the same on Mangiapane\u2019s place, a little over an hour to the northwest near the municipality of Cammarata. He peered from his barn toward an area where rainwater usually collected in a large pond, providing water for his animals, but the pond was now \u201cas dry as a football pitch.\u201d August typically brings the start of the winter rainy season, said Mangiapane, a longtime rancher who has gained a reputation as an outspoken supporter of natural grazing and small-scale cheese-making over industrial-scale agriculture.

No wheat, nor fodder for the cows. And neither the regional government, nor the national one have taken strong measures.\u201d Local authorities have rushed to open new wells, fix desalination equipment and bring in water. In late July, the first Italian navy tanker ship docked in Licata to supply 12 million liters (3.2 million gallons) to the most affected areas.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) The local water basin authority is tightly rationing water for almost a million residents, with water flowing as little as two to four hours a week in the most affected areas. While the taps are off, households and farms are being supplied by tankers since Sicily\u2019s aqueducts lose up to 60% of the water they carry, according to local water company AICA. As climate change has made rainfall more erratic and driven temperatures higher, there\u2019s hope that aqueduct renovations, new reservoirs and deep wells will help Sicily adapt. Giulio Boccaletti, scientific director of the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, said Sicily is experiencing \u201cthe new normal\u201d of climate change, and the region will have to examine whether its scarce water is used for the right things \u2014 including what farmers produce.

        "body": "AMHERST, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Since her arrest at a protest at the University of Massachusetts, Annie McGrew has been pivoting between two sets of hearings: one for the misdemeanor charges she faces in court, and another for violations of the college\u2019s conduct code.  It has kept the graduate student from work toward finishing her dissertation in economics.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a really rough few months for me since my arrest,\u201d McGrew said. \u201cI never imagined this is how UMass (administration) would respond.\u201d Some 3,200 people were arrested this spring during a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments protesting the war in Gaza. While some colleges ended demonstrations by striking deals with the students, or simply waited them out, others called in police when protesters refused to leave. Many students have already seen those charges dismissed. But the cases have yet to be resolved for hundreds of people at campuses that saw the highest number of arrests, according to an analysis of data gathered by The Associated Press and partner newsrooms.  Along with the legal limbo, those students face uncertainty in their academic careers. Some remain steadfast, saying they would have made the same decisions to protest even if they had known the consequences. Others have struggled with the aftermath of the arrests, harboring doubts about whether to stay enrolled in college at all. In St. Louis, Valencia Alvarez is waiting to hear what will come of the potential charges she and 99 others could face for a protest April 27 that lasted less than half a day at Washington University. \n Twenty-three of those arrested were students. In June, the university gave them two options: They could face a hearing with the Office of Student Conduct, or they could \u201caccept responsibility\u201d and forgo further investigation. Alvarez took the first option. \u201cI don\u2019t really plan on being quiet about this, and I think that\u2019s the goal of the second option,\u201d Alvarez said. The demonstrations swept public and private universities, on campuses large and small, urban and rural. As students return this fall, colleges are bracing for more protests against both Israel\u2019s military and Hamas, and strategizing over tactics including when to call in law enforcement \u2014 decisions that have had lasting reverberations. Some college leaders said calling police was the only option to end protests that stood in the way of commencement ceremonies, disrupted campus life and included instances of antisemitic signs and language.  Student groups and some faculty members have blasted college leaders for inviting police inside their gates. In their view, the police actions often trampled peaceful demonstrations with unnecessary levels of force.  The vast majority of the cases against the demonstrators \u2014 ranging from students and faculty to people without any ties to the colleges \u2014 involve misdemeanors or lower-level charges. Examples include trespassing, failure to disperse, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.  More serious charges were filed against demonstrators who occupied a campus building at Columbia University, where some were arrested initially on felony trespassing charges. Those were lowered to misdemeanors, and dozens of students have had their charges dropped. In a decision criticized by Jewish groups, prosecutors said there was a lack of evidence tying them to acts of property damage, and none of the students had criminal histories. \n Prosecutors in several cities are still evaluating whether to pursue charges. But in many cases, officials have indicated they do not intend to pursue low-level violations, according to AP\u2019s review of data on campuses with at least 100 arrests.  In upstate New York, the Ulster County district attorney asked judges to dismiss 129 cases stemming from arrests at the State University of New York at New Paltz. \u201cI have concluded that it is best to dismiss these charges now and relieve all concerned and the courts of any further burdens, expenses, and expenditures of scarce public and judicial resources,\u201d District Attorney Emmanuel Nneji wrote in June.  New Paltz students said they were sitting with their arms interlocked when officers hauled them away on May 2. \u201cIt was handled very brutally,\u201d said Maddison Tirado, a student whose trespassing charge has been dismissed. Tirado said protesters were treated as if authorities saw them \u201clike little terrorists running around.\u201d One student demonstrator, Ezra Baptist, said he was taken to a hospital with a concussion and a cut after being thrown forward and hitting his head during his arrest by state troopers. He was supposed to avoid looking at screens because of his injury and could not complete one class he needed to graduate in May. State police said if anyone believes troopers acted inappropriately, they should file a complaint so it can be investigated. Another police agency at the scene, the county sheriff\u2019s office, said officers showed restraint and that a trooper was injured when demonstrators threw bottles. Tensions have run high on college campuses since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants assaulted southern Israel and killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took about 250 hostages. Israel\u2019s offensive has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. For some students, the impact on their academic careers has affected them more than any legal jeopardy.  At Washington University, conduct hearings for arrested students began recently but have yet to result in disciplinary decisions. In the meantime, Alvarez does not have the master\u2019s degree in public health she would have received by now if not for her arrest.  Alvarez, who hopes to branch into social justice and community organizing, said she doesn\u2019t have regrets. But that\u2019s not to say the protest didn\u2019t come at a cost. \u201cI want that degree,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cI worked four jobs throughout my two years at Wash U to be able to afford tuition without pulling out any loans.\u201d At Emerson College in Boston, 118 people were arrested when police were asked to enforce a city ordinance against camping on public property. All were charged with disturbing the peace and granted \u201cpre-arraignment diversion,\u201d which means no charges will be filed in exchange for 40 hours of community service, prosecutors said. Owen Buxton, an Emerson student, said he suffered a concussion when police shoved him into a bronze statue. It was his second arrest of the semester for protesting the war in Gaza. The experience made it hard for him to concentrate or participate in classes. \u201cIt stifled all my creativity \u2014 I didn\u2019t make anything for months, which is not typical of me,\u201d said Buxton, a filmmaker. Emerson allowed students to take the semester pass-fail following an outcry over the arrests. A spokesperson for the Boston Police Department said anybody with concerns can file complaints with the internal affairs office. The department previously said there were no injuries during the Emerson arrests. At the UMass campus in Amherst, students recalled a peaceful demonstration with singing and dancing before police arrived. It was the second tent encampment students had put up that week. UMass Chancellor Javier Reyes said he ordered the sweep after discussions broke down with protesters. \u201cLet me be clear \u2014 involving law enforcement is the absolute last resort,\u201d Reyes wrote to the campus community.  The law enforcement response, including 117 police vehicles on campus, unsettled protesters. McGrew remembers seeing police with riot gear rushing the crowd of students. A total of 134 people were arrested.  As arrestees were processed at the university\u2019s sports arena, graduate student Charles Sullivan, who is transgender, said they felt humiliated by campus police. An officer, Sullivan said, forced them to loudly describe their genitalia to gain access to a restroom.  Sullivan has since decided to leave the university to continue their studies, in part because of the arrest. Wrapping up a master\u2019s degree in anthropology, Sullivan will move to Ohio in the fall to pursue a Ph.D., instead of continuing at UMass.  \u201cI think mostly I\u2019m just kind of ready to get out of this place,\u201d Sullivan said. Many campus organizations have rebuked Reyes for deploying police, including the UMass faculty senate, which passed a vote of no confidence against the chancellor. In June, Reyes announced a task force to review campus policies on demonstrations, including the land-use policy many arrestees were charged with violating. The group is just getting started with their work, said Anthony Paik, a member of the faculty senate and co-chair of the task force. It would have more information by the end of August, he said, just before the start of the new school year.

        "body": "Are you spending more time in the bathroom than you\u2019d like? Loads of TikTok posts show you\u2019re not alone. Young people, especially women, are increasingly talking on social media about gastrointestinal distress, such as irritable bowel syndrome or chronic bloating. Some experts say that\u2019s mostly a good thing, because it may help others seek help for a topic that has been taboo. But they stress it\u2019s important to realize that many people are being paid to promote sometimes unproven products and there is rampant misinformation. Here\u2019s what else medical professionals suggest you do if you\u2019re experiencing digestive discomfort.  It\u2019s not clear whether there\u2019s a rise in digestive troubles overall. Some experts attribute the trend to an uptick in anxiety after the pandemic in an already-anxious generation.  Ample research and science shows that our brain and gut are connected through nervous systems. That means when your brain is anxious or you\u2019re feeling depressed, it can relay those signals to your gut, which can make it harder for your gastrointestinal tract to function properly. The causes of irritable bowel syndrome are unknown, but experts say the nervous system has a big effect on the condition and stress can make symptoms worse.  Dr. Nina Gupta, a gastroenterologist based in Chicago, said managing her patients\u2019 conditions often includes managing their mental health. This article is part of AP\u2019s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. That depends on the level of your discomfort, said Dr. Uma Naidoo, Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry. She studies the connection between food and the brain. \n Abrupt changes in bowel habits are concerning, she said, and may require further evaluation.  \u201cFor example, someone that didn\u2019t really have digestive issues as a child or throughout their life and then all of a sudden is finding a very severe and significant change in their bowel habits,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are all things that we would want someone to talk to their doctor about.\u201d And if you see blood in your stool \u2014 no matter the quantity or degree of frequency \u2014 or have ongoing diarrhea for more than a couple of weeks, seek care immediately.  Naidoo said some mindfulness practices like stress management, meditation and breathwork can help. Food sensitivities can trigger IBS symptoms, so adjusting your diet and exercising more also may make a difference.  \u201cSimply doing something like finding a good probiotic that they take, or adding probiotics and fermented foods to their diet slowly and steadily can be good,\u201d she said. \u201cStress management is a huge part of this. In combination with dietary adjustment, it can be very powerful.\u201d However, if symptoms worsen or are unmanageable at home, that should be a sign to seek professional help.

        "body": "Maternity homes have seen a resurgence in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Across the country, homes are sprouting up or expanding. Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term. Maternity homes differ from emergency shelters: They typically provide longer-term housing and wraparound services for pregnant women, sometimes for months or even years after birth. Many of them are faith-based, with founders who are Catholic or evangelical. Maternity homes also have a fraught history of trauma, secrecy and shame. In the three decades before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption. In 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \u201cfallen women,\u201d who were encouraged to keep their children.  That goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families. The so-called \u201cbaby boom\u201d was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma. \n Between the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \u201cBaby Scoop Era,\u201d more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth. The homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays. Most residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated. Some maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time. Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye. \u201cI told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and \u2026 that I had no way to take her home,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was all very traumatizing.\u201d Many of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton\u2019s founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women. For some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \u201cWe had sinned and broken the rules of society,\u201d Wilson-Buterbaugh said. \u201cWhat happened to me was the defining element in my life,\u201d said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience. Pregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith\u2019s Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \u201cI was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\u201d For Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong. \u201cThey had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\u201d said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \u201cThe Girls Who Went Away.\u201d Many women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry. DNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states. Wilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\u201d she said, \u201cand the truth of what really happened dies with us.\u201d The social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. Ireland\u2019s mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century. Some Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country\u2019s treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \u201c The Shame Is Ours.\u201d In 2013, Australia\u2019s then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country\u2019s history of forced adoptions. \u201cTo you, the mothers \u2013 who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice \u2013 we apologize,\u201d she said. \u201cTo each of you who were adopted or removed \u2026 we say sorry.\u201d Ann Fessler, \u201cThe Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

        "body": "Extreme heat can raise the danger of heat-related illnesses and threaten health in a more subtle way \u2014 by amplifying the side effects of many common medications.  Hot weather, too, can damage medicines such as insulin that require refrigeration. Inhalers can explode. Epinephrine injectors such as EpiPens can malfunction. Meds delivered in the mail can deteriorate. A look at common problems and solutions related to heat and medicine: Blood pressure pills that reduce fluid in the blood can lead to dehydration. Beta blockers for heart conditions can decrease blood flow to the skin and make you less aware of dangerous heat. Some antidepressants can hinder your ability to stay cool. Aspirin and other over-the-counter pain relievers decrease fluid and sodium levels, making it harder to deal with high temperatures. On top of that, the combination of heat and drug side effects can lead to lightheadedness and falls. Alcohol increases the danger, said pharmacist Bradley Phillips of the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. You can learn more about your medications\u2019 side effects and storage requirements at the National Library of Medicine\u2019s MedlinePlus website.  Or talk to your doctor or pharmacist, Phillips said. Ask about how much water you should be drinking if you\u2019re on medications that increase dehydration. This article is part of AP\u2019s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. He recommends staying hydrated and \u201cnot relying on your body\u2019s ability to tell you that you\u2019re thirsty.\u201d \n Some medicines \u2014 antibiotics, antifungals and acne drugs \u2014 can heighten sensitivity to the sun, causing rashes and sunburns. If you\u2019re taking them, stay under an umbrella or wear sun-protective fabrics and sunscreen, said Dr. Mike Ren, a family physician at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cYou might be on antibiotics, not think too much of it, go down to the beach and then come back with a whopping sunburn,\u201d Ren said. Medication generally should be kept in a cool, dry place, unless it needs refrigeration. That can be challenging while traveling. Before a summer road trip, check labels for the storage requirements of your meds. Carry medicine in a cooler when traveling by car, even if it doesn\u2019t require refrigeration. The car\u2019s trunk or glove box could get too hot for even room temperature storage.  Traveling by plane? It\u2019s always best to keep medications in your carry-on bag in case your checked luggage is delayed or lost, and it can get too cold in the cargo hold. Mail-order pharmacies are responsible for keeping your drugs at safe temperatures during storage and transit. The best practice is to ship sensitive medicine in special packaging with ice packs and temperature monitors.  But that doesn\u2019t always happen. Or a delivery can come at a bad time, said Ren, who recently helped his vacationing mother by bringing her delivery of supplements into her Houston home as the region faced soaring heat. \u201cIf you know you\u2019re going to be at work all day, or if you\u2019re on vacation, and you get medications delivered, you definitely don\u2019t want that sitting outside in the hot 100-degree sun,\u201d Ren said. If you think your mail-order medication has been damaged by the heat, call the pharmacy to report the problem. Yes. Researchers in the U.S. and Australia say some of the common warnings about heat and drugs don\u2019t have a lot of scientific evidence behind them. Ollie Jay at the University of Sydney found backing for only four of the 11 medication categories that the World Health Organization lists as concerns with high heat. He suggests changing behavior, not medications, like staying out of the heat. \u201cBe a bit more cautious,\u201d he said. Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency room physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, said as climate change accelerates, there\u2019s a need to know which medicines are the riskiest in the heat. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that answer yet, and it\u2019s one that we need to rapidly figure out,\u201d Salas said.

        "body": "About half the U.S. state attorneys general traveled to France in a trip cosponsored by a group mostly funded by companies, including some under scrutiny of the top state lawyers. Attorneys general are among the most visible officials in state governments and the job can be a launching pad to the world stage. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, previously held the post in California. Joining together gives AGs a chance to share concerns, develop bonds and strategies and talk with officials in other countries. The trips can be posh and provide opportunities for company lobbyists to rub elbows with them. Companies that have picked up the bill and sent representatives in recent years have been from the pharmaceutical, auto, financial, online gaming and tech industries, among others. Organizers said this summer\u2019s trip is \u201csolely focused on commemorating and paying tribute to the achievements and sacrifices of those who fought in Normandy,\u201d even though they are taking place nearly two months after the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion on June 6, which was commemorated by a gathering of world leaders. The National Association of Attorneys General, known as AGA, a century-old organization that cosponsored the trip to France for attorneys general, would not provide dates for the event, but one AG said it was set for July 29 to Aug. 3. The trip illuminates how corporate lawyers and lobbyists can gain access to officials who regulate their businesses with help from the Attorney General Alliance, one of the groups behind the event. \n \u201cLobbyists essentially fund these trips,\u201d said Christopher Toth, a former AGA executive director. \u201cThey funnel the money through AGA, and then that insulates the AGs from being criticized that they\u2019re taking money from lobbyists.\u201d It also shields them from criticism that they are traveling abroad on taxpayers\u2019 dime. The AGA said 26 attorneys general were going on the trip. The nonprofit group said the Olympics were not on the itinerary, though the marquee international athletic competitions coincided with it. In 2022, the group sponsored a trip to Qatar in time with the FIFA World Cup soccer games, which some AGs attended. The group said it would not make public the 2024 schedule or exactly which AGs were attending in France because of security concerns. \u201cThis event, like all others, was scheduled based on availability of attorneys general and hotel & conference space,\u201d Tania Maestas, an AGA lawyer, said in an email. Maestas declined to answer whether any of the corporate sponsors were giving attorneys general tickets to Olympic games. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, a Democrat, said she would be attending an Olympic soccer game in addition to the Normandy events and that the tickets, and a few days of a vacation in France with her husband, would be at her expense. Other AGs said they would not attend the games or ignored queries from The Associated Press. Attorneys general are the chief government lawyers in their states. All of them have roles in consumer protection and many in law enforcement. They are elected in 43 states and appointed in the other seven. A big shift in the job began in the 1990s, when the states banded together to sue the tobacco industry over dangers caused by smoking. The deal opened the door for other huge multistate lawsuits and settlements over opioids, failing car airbags and other consumer protection issues. That use of the office \u2014 ensuring corporate accountability \u2014 gave rise to other developments. Now, some major law firms have departments specializing in representing companies that come under the scrutiny of AGs. Those departments, which frequently employ former AGs or their deputies, have all the motivation to lobby people in the job, as do the companies they represent. Over time, the Conference of Western Attorneys General expanded its core topics from largely regional concerns such as water resources and challenges facing Native American communities to a broader range of issues and in 2019 they created the nationwide AGA. The group\u2019s tax filings show it both brought in and spent about $10 million from July 2022 through June 2023. More than $6 million in expenses were on travel, conferences and meetings and events. Much of the organization\u2019s revenue has come in the form of sponsorships. While the tax filings do not list the donors, an AGA brochure from 2023, provided by a lawyer specializing in AG practice who requested anonymity because of fear of professional retribution, shows how it works: Corporate sponsors could send more people to AGA events by contributing more money. For instance, $20,000 contributors could have three seats at events during the year. Those who gave $150,000 could have 30. More than 200 companies were listed as sponsors at various levels.  The AGA did not respond to questions about the brochure. \u201cWith the AGA, you have these regulated industries outright giving money to the organization,\u201d said Paul Nolette, a Marquette University political scientist who studies AGs. Brian Frosh, a Democrat who served as Maryland\u2019s attorney general from 2015 until last year, said he recalled attending just one or two of the group\u2019s dinners early in his time in office but he did not attend any of the larger events, which have included international trips to China, Morocco, Ireland and elsewhere. \u201cThe dinners that I went to, you would sit next to a lobbyist for a different interest,\u201d Frosh said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019d get up and move to another table. I didn\u2019t find that to be enjoyable or educational.\u201d A 2021 version of the AGA publication shows two companies contributed at least $500,000 that year: Amazon and Pfizer.  Both have come under scrutiny from AGs. Last year, 17 attorneys general joined with the Federal Trade Commission to sue Amazon, claiming the online retailer inflated prices and overcharged sellers.  Drugmaker Pfizer has faced legal action from AGs on multiple fronts. Texas AG Ken Paxton sued last year, claiming the company misrepresented the effectiveness of its COVID-19 vaccines and tried to censor public discourse about it. Pfizer also has been a target of multiple AG lawsuits over drug prices. Colin Provost, an associate professor of public policy at University College London who studies U.S. state AGs, said events where they mingle with lobbyists don\u2019t necessarily help companies get the outcomes they hope for. \u201cThe optics are often not good,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of actually proving that this has sort of a corrupting influence, that\u2019s harder to do.\u201d Associated Press reporters from around the U.S. contributed to this article."

In clear, deep blue water, thousands of creatures \u2014 fish, hammerhead sharks, marine iguanas \u2014 move in search of food.  The 2021 collapse of Darwin\u2019s Arch, named for the famed British naturalist behind the theory of evolution, came from natural erosion. But its demise underscored the fragility of a far-flung archipelago that\u2019s coming under increased pressure both from climate change and invasive species.

(AP Photo/Alie Skowronski)  Warming oceans affect the food sources of many of the seagoing animals in the Galapagos. Marine iguanas \u2014 one of many species that are endemic, or unique, to the Galapagos \u2014 have a harder time finding the red and green algae they prefer. Sea turtles struggle to nest in warmer temperatures. Raising young gets harder as water warms and fewer nutrients are available. The Galapagos Islands and its many creatures have always been sensitive to changes in ocean temperatures. But the significant warming from climate change in recent years has put pressure on many species in the remote islands off the coast of Ecuador. (AP Video/Alie Skowronski)  While the Galapagos are known for a great multitude of species, their numbers aren\u2019t unlimited.  \u201cWe have something of everything here \u2013 that\u2019s why people say the Galapagos is so diverse \u2013 but we have a small number of each thing,\u201d said Natasha Cabezas, a naturalist guide.

(AP Photo/Alie Skowronski)  The Galapagos have always been sensitive to changes in ocean temperature. The archipelago itself is located where major ocean currents converge \u2014 cool from the south, warm from the north, and a cold upwelling current from the west. Then there\u2019s El Nino, the periodic and natural Pacific Ocean warming that affects weather worldwide.  \n  While temperatures vary depending on the season and other naturally-occurring climate events, ocean temperatures have been rising because of human-caused climate change as oceans absorb the vast majority of excess heat in the atmosphere. The ocean experienced its warmest decade since at least the 1800s in the last 10 years, and 2023 was the ocean\u2019s warmest year on record.  Early June brings winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and the Cromwell current brings whale sharks, hammerheads, and massive sunfish to the surface. It also provides nutrients for penguins, marine iguanas and sea lions in search of food. As more of those animals make themselves known this season, scientists are tracking how they fared in the warming of the past year\u2019s El Nino.   El Nino can bring food shortages for some species like marine iguanas and sea turtles, as the warmer ocean means dwindling food sources. Scientists observing the species have noted a significant decline in population numbers during El Nino events.   Marine iguanas swim like snakes through the water from rock to rock as waves crash against the shore of Fernandina Island. They latch themselves onto the undersea rocks to feed on algae growing there, while sea lions spin around them like puppies looking for someone to play with.   The iguanas were \u201cone of the most affected species from El Ni\u00f1o last year and right now they are still recovering,\u201d said Galapagos Conservancy Director Jorge Carri\u00f3n.

(AP Photo/Alie Skowronski)  As rising ocean temperatures threaten aquatic or seagoing life, on land there\u2019s a different problem. Feral animals \u2014 cats, dogs, pigs, goats and cattle, none of them native \u2014 are threatening the unique species of the islands.  After the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are abandoning the dogs and cats they wanted to keep them company, Cabezas said.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t take care of them they become a problem and now it\u2019s a shame to see dogs everywhere. We have a big problem right now I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d she said.

(AP Photo/Alie Skowronski)  The non-native animals are a special threat to the giant tortoises closely associated with the Galapagos. The tortoises declined dramatically in the 19th century due to hunting and poaching, and authorities have worked to protect them from humans. It\u2019s been illegal to kill a giant tortoise since 1933.  \u201cIn one night, a feral pig can destroy all nesting sites in an area,\u201d Carri\u00f3n said. Park rangers try to visit areas with nesting sites once a day, and kill pigs when they find them. But the pigs are elusive, Carrion said.  Feral cats feed on marine iguana hatchings, and both pigs and cats compete for food with the tortoises.

        "body": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 The road races in cycling at the Olympics are an opportunity for the host city to shine.   The routes that the men and women traverse over several grueling hours and hundreds of kilometers of racing typically pass some of its most iconic historical and cultural landmarks. They provide a stunning backdrop to the marquee event of the cycling program at the Summer Games, while making for spectacular pictures on TV as the riders zip by at high speeds. Live updates: Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the 2024 Olympics in Paris as Simone Biles, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and Karie Ledecky compete for gold medals.  Few cities can match Paris when it comes to historical and cultural landmarks.  The course for the men covers 273 kilometers (170 miles) on Saturday while the women covers 158 kilometers (98 miles) on Sunday. And here is a look at what riders will see as they covered the cobbles and tarmac in the race for a medal:      The start of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s road races is the Pont d\u2019Iena, the bridge crossing the River Seine commissioned by Napoleon to celebrate his victory at the Battle of Jena. It connects the Trocad\u00e9ro on the Right Bank, which was the highlight of the opening ceremony just over a week ago, to the Eiffel Tower on the Left Bank, where the Olympic beach volleyball stadium was built.       The races will head west out of Paris on their way to Versailles, the former royal hunting lodge-turned-opulent residence that was commissioned by King Louis XIV and used by Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The spectacular palace is a UNESCO world heritage site. It contains more than 2,300 rooms, including the famed Hall of Mirrors, along with picturesque gardens that have served as the backdrop for Olympic equestrian events during the Paris Games.        The road races will continue deep into the countryside. They pass the V\u00e9lodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, where the French completed the first podium sweep of an event at the Summer Games in a century in men\u2019s BMX racing Friday night, and where track cycling begins Monday. They also will flash by Le Golf National, the site of the 2018 Ryder Cup and the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Olympic golf tournaments, before hitting the Vall\u00e9e de Chevreuse, where the Yvette River flows. Gonzalo Dominguez of Mexico City wears an Olympic flag as he tours the grounds of the Chateau de Versailles. (AP Photo/David Goldman)   \n  The parade of iconic locations truly begins when the riders return to Paris. They will catch a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, where the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci hangs, and Palais Garnier, the famed opera house. Later, they traverse the Canal St. Martin, which runs south to the Seine, and visit lesser known sights such as Caf\u00e9 des Deux Moulins, named in part for the nearby Moulin Rouge and famous after appearing in the film \u201cAm\u00e9lie.\u201d Competitors ride past the Eiffel Tower as they start the men\u2019s road cycling event at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Saturday, Aug. 3, 2024, in Paris. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus)    The men\u2019s and women\u2019s races will likely be decided by finishing circuits at Montmartre, the hill in the northern part of Paris that is popular among artists and offers grand vistas of the city. The sharp climbs and uneven cobbled surfaces will make for a difficult test for the riders, but the sight of brightly colored jerseys whizzing by the white-domed basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur should provide one of the most memorable moments of the Olympic road race. The Stade de France is seen behind Sacre Coeur. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner)    After their third trip up Montmartre, riders head down toward the Seine and cross the Pont du Carrousel, which connects the Louvre on one bank to Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay on the other bank. The roads eventually widen as riders take a right-hand turn and follow the river back to the finish, where they cross in front of the Eiffel Tower on a flat run-in to the line.

        "body": "BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Holder of one-fifth of the world\u2019s fresh water, the Amazon is beginning the dry season with many of its rivers already at critically low levels, prompting governments to anticipate contingency measures to address issues ranging from disrupted navigation to increasing forest fires. \u201cThe Amazon Basin is facing one of the most severe droughts in recent years in 2024, with significant impacts on several member countries,\u201d stated a technical note issued Wednesday by the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, which includes Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela.

Historically, the driest months are August and September, when fire and deforestation peak. So far, the most affected countries are Bolivia, Peru and Brazil, according to ACTO. On Monday, Brazil\u2019s federal water agency decreed a water shortage in two major basins, Madeira and Purus, which cover an area nearly the size of Mexico. The next day, Acre state declared an emergency amid an impending water shortage in its main city. In June, neighboring Amazonas state adopted the same measure in 20 of its 62 municipalities that are mostly only accessed by water or air, even in normal times. These steps were taken more than two months earlier than in 2023, when most of the Amazon basin suffered its worst drought on record, killing dozens of river dolphins, choking cities with smoke for months and isolating thousands of people who depended on water transportation. The measures are used to increase monitoring, mobilize resources and personnel and request federal aid.

In 2023, that occurred on Aug. 15. Navigation has been limited during nighttime, and two of Brazil\u2019s largest hydroelectric plants may halt production, as happened last year. In the Amazonas town of Envira, nearby rivers have become too shallow to navigate. Local officials have asked elders and pregnant women to move from riverine communities to the city center because otherwise medical help may not be able to reach them. Farmers who produce cassava flour can\u2019t get it to market. As a result, this Amazon food staple has more than doubled in price, according to the local administration. Another concern is fire. There were around 25,000 fires from January until late July \u2014 the highest number for this period in almost two decades. In the Amazon, fires are mostly human-made and used to manage pastures and clear deforested areas.

These communities now depend on trucked-in water, a problem experienced the previous year. Between the two droughts, severe flooding hit 19 of the state\u2019s 22 municipalities. \u201cIt\u2019s been two years in a row of extreme events,\u201d Julie Messias, Acre\u2019s secretary of environment, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe result is that we are facing a threat of food shortage. First the crops were flooded, and now the planting period is very dry.\u201d The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris has secured enough delegates to become the Democratic presidential nominee, according to Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison, but it\u2019s not time for the balloon drop just yet. Harrison made the announcement Friday as part of a livestreamed video organized by the Harris campaign, although neither the DNC nor the Harris campaign provided a comprehensive vote tally. Delegates to the Democratic National Convention began officially selecting their nominee for president in a process that kicked off Thursday. But unlike in past years, they are not doing so in the raucous party atmosphere of the convention floor or even during the convention itself. Instead, they are participating in what the party calls a \u201cvirtual roll call\u201d and filling out electronic ballots at their homes, offices and vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago\u2019s United Center. Harris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline. She\u2019s looking to officially claim the nomination on Monday evening when the DNC is expected to release final results. Nearly 4,700 delegates are using an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely. \n Under new procedures adopted by the convention\u2019s rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition. Any vote cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call will be counted as \u201cpresent.\u201d Voting will remain open until Monday at 6 p.m. ET, and Harrison urged delegates who had not voted yet to do so by the deadline. Among those voting are pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members. These automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.  What to know about the 2024 Election After the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did. The DNC said in a statement on Friday that it would announce final, state-by-state results after voting concludes on Monday. That\u2019s a departure from how presidential roll calls are usually conducted by either party. In past conventions, the roll call votes were tallied in real time before a national audience, with state delegations announcing their votes from the convention floor or, in the case of the 2020 Democratic convention, through remote video presentations from every state and territory. Friday\u2019s livestreamed event from the Harris campaign provided an occasional update on what is said was the overall vote tally before Harrison\u2019s announcement but not a real-time breakdown by state or an indication of how many votes were cast for \u201cpresent.\u201d The DNC has not provided any vote updates since Harrison\u2019s announcement. Once Harris officially wins the nomination, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee. Harris said Tuesday she had not yet decided on her No. 2. But she, and whomever she selects, will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, next week.  DNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio\u2019s deadline to file for the general election ballot is Aug. 7, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention. Although the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \u201c a Democratic problem.\u201d  The Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials decided to move forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned. Although the official balloting and vote-counting are taking place remotely and mostly behind closed doors, aside from one delegate\u2019s announcement of her vote during the Harris campaign\u2019s livestreamed event, the DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the traditional ritual of state delegations announcing their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare."
