        "body": "Apple is teaming up with the San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund, Sobrato Philanthropies, and Destination: Home \u2014 all experts in affordable housing development \u2014 to launch the new Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund. This fund, which will make targeted, favorable loans to advance affordable housing development, is part of Apple\u2019s broader $2.5 billion commitment to address housing affordability in communities across California.\n \u201cWe believe everyone deserves a place to call home, and\u00a0we\u2019re proud that Apple\u2019s $2.5 billion initiative\u00a0is supporting more affordable housing options across the state,\u201d said Kristina Raspe, Apple\u2019s vice president of Global Real Estate and Facilities. \u201cIncreasing access to safe and affordable housing is essential for thriving communities here, and\u00a0we\u2019re excited to help launch the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund as part of our long-term commitment to our home state.\u201d\n With an initial $50 million investment, the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund will support four projects in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, creating more than 400 homes within the next two years. Using proven methods, the fund is uniquely focused on removing barriers that affordable housing developers frequently encounter in order to deliver high-quality units faster and for significantly less than current industry averages.\n \u201cWe cannot effectively address the homelessness and affordability crises in the Bay Area if we continue building and funding affordable housing in the same way,\u201d explained Rebecca Foster, CEO of the San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund, which will manage the new fund. \u201cWe must think outside the box to significantly reduce costs and timelines. This fund is designed to showcase what is possible when we have clear goals, a shared commitment to meet these targets, and a simplified financing structure. We\u2019re so grateful to Apple for helping to anchor this fund and bringing their innovative thinking to this important community work.\u201d\n Next week, Mercy Housing will celebrate breaking ground on a new affordable development in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, marking the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund\u2019s first project to begin construction. The project will provide 145 units of permanent supportive housing for seniors experiencing or at imminent risk of experiencing homelessness. The fund\u2019s anticipated second project is expected to break ground in Santa Cruz later this year.\n Including this new investment in the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund, Apple has now allocated over $1.6 billion to supporting affordable housing initiatives in California, directly benefitting more than 60,000 Californians. With support from Apple, affordable housing developers are building or preserving more than 10,000 units across more than 90 developments statewide \u2014 many of which have already been completed and are currently housing community members. Apple has also helped more than 35,000 Bay Area residents who were at risk of losing their homes remain housed, and has assisted more than 2,500 first-time homebuyers finance their homes.\n In addition to the three Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund anchor partners, Apple is also working with Housing Trust Silicon Valley, California Housing Finance Agency, United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and developers across California to address the state\u2019s housing crisis.\n"

        "body": "Empathy and storytelling. Motivational and strategic leadership. These are just a handful of the qualities participants in this year\u2019s PROPEL Center Arts & Entertainment Industry Accelerator identified in their \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Superpower?\u201d course, designed to empower students to uncover and embrace their authentic selves throughout their careers.\n \u201cI think the empathy comes from me being a first child. I\u2019ve always looked out for my younger siblings and cousins and wanted to make sure that they are good,\u201d says Liza Montgomery, a 2024 mass communications graduate from Xavier University of Louisiana. Montgomery was one of more than 100 students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who were selected for PROPEL\u2019s creative arts accelerator.\n Discovering their superpowers is just one way students are learning to prepare for their careers after graduation. Since February, the students have completed micro-credential courses through the PROPEL Learn app, participated in virtual career panels with professionals at Apple, and attended r\u00e9sum\u00e9-writing workshops to build their portfolios and begin preparing for their career journeys.\n This summer, 50 participants \u2014 including Montgomery \u2014 were selected from 19 HBCUs to attend an immersive 10-day experience on the campuses of Tennessee State University in Nashville and Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta. There, they received mentorship from HBCU faculty and industry professionals in both creative and executive roles, and worked side by side with experts at the Apple Music Nashville office.\n The accelerator was launched with the PROPEL Center as part of Apple\u2019s $25 million investment through its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative\u00a0to help dismantle systemic barriers to opportunity and combat injustices faced by communities of color. Its curricula was designed to provide new pathways for HBCU students into careers in industries that are notoriously competitive.\n \u201cSubject-matter experts are everything along this journey,\u201d says Dr. Lisa Herring, the PROPEL Center\u2019s president. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more powerful than for a student to be able to interface with someone who is the expert as they seek to become one. Apple\u2019s belief in being able to not only be a partner, but to be at the table, move from the table, and then be in the field, and then be side by side with our students and instructors \u2014 that\u2019s commitment down to the details.\u201d\n The PROPEL Center is a first-of-its-kind global innovation and learning hub for HBCUs. To support the next generation of diverse leaders, PROPEL provides educational programming and career preparation across a wide range of disciplines, including AI, agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment, app development, augmented reality, design, and the creative arts. Experts from Apple help develop the curricula, and provide ongoing mentorship and internship opportunities.\n \u201cWhen we launched our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative four years ago, we did so with a clear mission to advance equity and create greater access to opportunity for under-resourced communities,\u201d says Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. \u201cThese are persistent and systemic challenges, and we are committed to working with partners, including PROPEL Center, to close the existing gaps and achieve meaningful change. Our collaboration with PROPEL is designed to provide talented students with the technology, resources, and expertise they need to become industry leaders, whether they pursue roles in arts and entertainment, technology, or beyond.\u201d\n In Nashville, students visited the National Museum of African American Music for a fireside chat with Ebro Darden, Apple Music\u2019s global editorial head of Hip Hop and R&B; got hands-on with experts in their fields at the Apple Music Nashville office and Universal Music Group\u2019s East Iris Studios; and participated in an experience with the Apple Downtown Nashville store.\n Accelerator participants also collaborated on projects that speak to this year\u2019s theme, \u201cPropelling Preservation.\u201d Through their work, the 10-person teams showcased how Black creatives have contributed to social movements \u2014 and how they can ignite a new era that sustains HBCU culture for future generations.\n \u201c\u2018Propelling preservation\u2019 is about documenting the people that haven\u2019t had a voice,\u201d Montgomery says. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been trying to do with my art is accurately communicate the voices and experiences that haven\u2019t been included for a very long time. For me, it\u2019s about making sure I\u2019m documenting people of color\u2019s stories, and what they look like in their most authentic and vibrant states.\u201d\n \u201cA lot of times, when people think Black social justice movement, they think negative,\u201d adds Emmanuel Strickland, a Tennessee State University student and emerging R&B singer who is one of Montgomery\u2019s teammates. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to flip it to a positive. Our project is about HBCU love and different things that we go through as college students on a daily basis \u2014 how we move together as a unit. No matter what HBCU you go to, you\u2019re going to be able to relate.\u201d\n As part of the project, each team was assigned a genre and tasked to record a music single, put together a marketing plan, shoot a visual campaign using iPhone, and pitch their concept to a panel of judges made up of industry professionals.\n In her role, Montgomery designed the marketing plan and the cover art for her group\u2019s song. While using Apple Pencil and the Procreate app on her iPad Pro, she was grateful for its speed and the versatility the app\u2019s tools provide.\n \u201cThe way Procreate and my iPad with Apple Pencil can imitate a traditionally drawn art piece is amazing because it\u2019s not just a flat piece,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt has the capacity to show dimension, texture, shiny objects, and even animation. Using Procreate really makes the possibilities pretty limitless for digital artworks.\u201d\n Growing up, Strickland \u2014 who performs under the name \u201cMille Manny\u201d \u2014 was constantly surrounded by music. His home was filled with the sounds of his mother and sisters\u2019 voices belting out tunes from female superstars including Mariah Carey, Selena, and even Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cBeing from Memphis, you\u2019re born with that soul in you,\u201d he says.\n As his career takes off, Strickland is always thinking up his next song. When inspiration strikes, he records lyrics and melodies in Voice Memos on his iPhone 13 Pro Max. And at home, his MacBook and Neumann microphone serve as a mini studio as he produces tracks in Pro Tools.\n During the accelerator, Strickland, Montgomery, and their teammates collaborated with artist, producer, musician, and songwriter Fresh Ayr \u2014 who provided the beat for their track \u2014 and the audio engineering team at UMG East Iris Studios to produce their song in Logic Pro. This level of access and visibility for the students is just one of the benefits of the program.\n \u201cThe biggest \u2018aha\u2019 moment for me would probably be understanding that it\u2019s not what you see on the surface, but what\u2019s underneath,\u201d says Strickland. \u201cThe accelerator is enlightening, showing how to do a tour, or this is what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. We\u2019re realizing that it\u2019s more than just a couple of people that you can see making things happen.\u201d\n \u201cThe PROPEL program does a really great job of giving HBCU students a platform to truly show who we are. We are given the opportunity to express ourselves artistically, build invaluable relationships, and have authentic conversations with industry professionals who are in positions that we aspire to be in as we grow throughout our careers,\u201d Montgomery adds.\n As the aspiring creatives, musicians, and even accountants and lawyers made their way around Nashville during the accelerator, that level of access to industry professionals was invaluable. The students took part in candid conversations about how the industry works, gained deeper insight into unexpected areas with the most opportunities for new talent, and learned from the personal experiences of artists like Kirk Franklin, a world-renowned gospel musician who had to navigate the historically inaccessible industry on his own.\n \u201cA lot of the students are coming from various schools and various backgrounds,\u201d says Sylvester Polk, a music engineering mentor at the accelerator who teaches music technology at Bethune-Cookman University, an HBCU in Daytona Beach, Florida. \u201cSome of them have been exposed to a lot already, some of them don\u2019t have any idea. There\u2019s so many fields and so many skills that are required in various areas that it can be open to lots of people. The accelerator has been great for providing the students with a holistic understanding of what the industry is and how it works, and PROPEL has been able to provide an extension to the classroom.\u201d\n \u201cIt allows us to be in the room. It allows us to be heard. It allows us to have the reach to actually talk to the people who are in the industry that we\u2019re aspiring to be in,\u201d says Strickland. \u201cWith this program, there are going to be internships that come out of this. There will be apprenticeships that come out of this. There are going to be real-life connections that people can foster, nurture, and potentially really make something shake with.\u201d\n"

        "body": "Apple\u2019s annual Swift Student Challenge recognizes the best in student coding, and this year, it has added a new category to its ranks. Out of 350 winning submissions, 50 students have been named Distinguished Winners for building app playgrounds that stand out for their innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity. These 50 students have been invited to a three-day in-person experience at Apple Park that includes tailored programming and the special event at this year\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where they\u2019ll join like-minded creators from all over the world.\n \u201cThis year\u2019s winning Swift Student Challenge submissions once again demonstrate the breadth and depth of what is possible when talented young people use coding to make their mark on the world,\u201d said Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. \u201cWe\u2019re also incredibly proud to welcome more outstanding student developers than ever before to Apple Park to connect with our teams and each other as they continue to build apps that will no doubt transform our future for the better.\u201d\n This year\u2019s winners come from all over the globe, representing more than 35 countries and regions. Many of their app playgrounds were sparked by something personal, such as helping people in their community or a favorite hobby. For Distinguished Winners Elena Galluzzo, Dezmond Blair, and Jawaher Shaman, inspiration also came from their families \u2014 and they share the hope that one day, their apps can make an impact on others as well.\n Elena Galluzzo, 22, divides her time between Waterloo, Ontario, where she\u2019s finishing her undergraduate degree at Wilfrid Laurier University, and her family home in the suburbs of Toronto. She shares that home with her parents, her sister, and her maternal grandparents, who were the inspiration for her winning app, Care Capsule.\n \u201cMy grandmother is in the late stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and requires full-time care,\u201d says Galluzzo. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also hard on my grandfather because it can be quite lonely \u2014 even though he lives with his children and grandchildren, a lot of older people don\u2019t. Canada has an aging population, so I think it\u2019s really important to keep looking into ways we can help people in this field, and coding is one way I can contribute.\u201d\n Galluzzo designed Care Capsule to be an all-in-one assistant for elderly people. She used Apple\u2019s machine learning framework Create ML to build a chatbot that analyzes interactions with the user to deduce whether they are experiencing loneliness or depression. The app also lets users track their medications, connect with community resources, and keep a record of positive memories.\n After Galluzzo graduates with a degree in business this spring, she hopes to publish Care Capsule on the App Store, potentially incorporating what she learns when she attends WWDC24 in June.\n \u201cBeing able to meet other people who have the same passion as I do is very exciting,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m also really looking forward to seeing what new frameworks are coming out and how I could use them. I think it\u2019s very cool to be able to create something that can tap into your device\u2019s native functionality and help solve important challenges at the same time.\u201d\n Dezmond Blair, 22, grew up in Canton, Michigan, and spent a lot of his time outdoors mountain biking with his little brother. His family had a secondhand computer, but they couldn\u2019t afford to connect it to the internet.\n \u201cAfter growing up in a trailer park, it became really important for me to make sure that I was keeping up on all my grades because my parents told me when I was young, \u2018You\u2019re definitely not ending up like we were,\u2019\u201d says Blair. \u201cThey spent a lot of their life trying to make sure that I wouldn\u2019t have to struggle the same way they did, and so that\u2019s where my inspiration and my passion comes from.\u201d\n He worked hard in high school and discovered he had a knack for technology, eventually getting his associate\u2019s degree in computer programming. Last year, Blair started at the Apple Developer Academy in Detroit, where he was introduced to Apple\u2019s coding language Swift. With it, he created his winning iPad app called MTB XTREME, which puts users behind the handlebars of a mountain bike, offering a 360-degree view of the trails around them. Eventually, Blair wants to release an even more immersive version for Apple Vision Pro.\n In addition to working on his own apps, Blair recently started his own company that helps to design app prototypes, which he cleverly named Easy Dez It \u2014 though his most important goal for the future comes back to his parents.\n \u201cI want to end up buying them a house one day,\u201d says Blair. \u201cThey\u2019ve done so much for me and my little brother, so I have to pay it forward.\u201d\n Growing up in Saudi Arabia, Jawaher Shaman was very close to her grandfather. When she was 5, he passed away, and soon after, she developed a stutter that became debilitating. Over time, and with the help of her father, she was able to learn ways to manage it and no longer stutters. Now 27 and studying at the Apple Developer Academy in Riyadh, Shaman\u2019s winning app playground, My Child, aims to help others with speech conditions.\n \u201cMy father never made me feel different, and I hope my app will do the same for any child or young person who suffers from stuttering,\u201d says Shaman. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to ever feel like stuttering is a hurdle they can\u2019t overcome.\u201d\n My Child tells Shaman\u2019s story through the eyes of a child who stutters, and features characters inspired by her father and grandfather. The app guides users through exercises that help slow down their breathing and prepare them for real-life experiences like reading a story in class. Shaman used AVFAudio to add sounds that mimic the way her father would break sentences into small, more manageable parts.\n After graduation, Shaman will work as a programmer in Saudi Arabia, and she also wants to publish My Child on the App Store and continue creating apps that assist others.\n \u201cI hope to use technology to help children who are neurodivergent because I know what it\u2019s like to feel different,\u201d says Shaman. \u201cCoding for me opened up a world of possibilities, and it brings me one step closer to achieving my goals, which are to help people and create a lasting impact.\u201d\n Apple is proud to champion the next generation of developers, creators, and entrepreneurs through its annual WWDC student program. Over the past four decades, thousands of students from all over the world have built successful careers, founded businesses, and created organizations focused on democratizing technology and using it to build a better future.\n"

        "body": "Driving along Ocean Avenue around 3:30 a.m. on a cool Friday morning in March, most of Santa Monica is perfectly quiet and still. But as the car approaches Colorado Avenue, a low din of voices begins to build. Every block, it grows louder and louder, until suddenly its source becomes clear, illuminated beneath the blazing neon at the entrance to the city\u2019s iconic pier.\n Hundreds of people have gathered here for the start of The Speed Project, an annual relay event that attracts brave souls from all over the world. The energy is electric: Team RVs covered with DIY signage line the street, massive flags ripple in the wind, and a drone flies overhead, casting an otherworldly glow on the undulating crowd. As the clock strikes 4 a.m., the teams scatter off in every direction.\n Members of Los Angeles\u2019s Koreatown Run Club (KRC) and New York City\u2019s Old Man Run Club (OMRC) have been training for this day for months, joining forces from their respective coasts to take on the grueling 300-plus-mile route through the Mojave Desert to Las Vegas. There are no rules, no support stations, no spectators, no rain delays \u2014 just the runners, their navigators, their crew, and the open road. And that\u2019s a big part of the appeal.\n Through it all \u2014 the rugged landscape, the sleep deprivation, the dehydration, the extreme temperatures, and the pouring rain \u2014 Apple Watch Ultra 2 was an essential companion, offering the 12-member team the ability to instantly keep tabs on each others\u2019 locations, take hands-free calls, keep an eye on their pace, provide visibility in the darkness, and view their elevation.\n \u201cApple Watch Ultra 2 was our instant lifeline to each other,\u201d says Cindy Le, the team\u2019s veteran navigator and crew captain \u2014 a sentiment echoed by cocaptain Ja Tecson.\n \u201cThe watch is truly made for the conditions we were going through, especially when we did our trail runs at night,\u201d Tecson adds.\n Made from aerospace-grade titanium, Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple\u2019s most capable and rugged watch, with the best battery life of any Apple Watch, advanced running metrics, easy-to-read Workout Views, a range of training experiences, and Apple\u2019s brightest display.\n The team\u2019s photographers \u2014 A.J. Lising, Jeremy Jude Lee, and Ja Tecson \u2014 documented their journey in a series of images shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max, and edited in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with an analog aesthetic, capturing the emotion of each moment.\n"

        "body": "In South America\u2019s Atlantic Forest, many suggest that life depends on a mother: the superior matriarch who provides for all. This is true for its plants and animals, and even the trees that tower above, reaching skyward to the sun while providing shade for the life that resides in their underbrush.\n It is estimated there are 5,000 tree species in existence in the Atlantic Forest today. Of those species, two-thirds are threatened with extinction after centuries of exploitative, extractive practices. Restoring the rainforest \u2014 a potential 100 million-acre restoration area in Brazil alone \u2014 has been at the core of Apple-supported projects in the region, including one just inland from the coastal town of Trancoso in Bahia, Brazil, where one company is cultivating seedlings from mother trees, the most resilient trees from multiple species that have survived the rainforest\u2019s destruction.\n \u201cWe started with the best genetic material possible, harvested in a huge native reserve of the Atlantic rainforest,\u201d explains Bruno Mariani, forest management and investment company Symbiosis\u2019s founder and CEO. \u201cThat would attract a lot of fauna and insects.\u201d\n Founded in 2008, Symbiosis has been collecting, banking, and planting seeds from mother trees of various Brazilian native species since 2010. \u201cThe mother tree represents the nature that provides us all the energy and the basis for restoration, so the mother tree gives us all,\u201d says Mickael Mello, Symbiosis\u2019s plant nursery manager.\n Symbiosis is one of three investments that are part of Apple\u2019s Restore Fund, announced in 2021 with the goal of scaling nature-based solutions to address climate change. In partnership with Goldman Sachs and Conservation International, the Restore Fund has invested in three carbon removal projects across Brazil and Paraguay with the aim of delivering benefits that go far beyond carbon \u2014 from strengthening local livelihoods to enhancing biodiversity.\n Since their first planting, which consisted of 160 different species spread across an area that will be permanently protected from wood harvesting, Symbiosis has expanded its restoration of threatened native trees. In its efforts to decrease biodiversity loss, Symbiosis has committed to conserving 40 percent of its land with natural, multispecies forests, while the remaining land supplies precious tropical hardwoods from responsibly managed sources. After planting 800 hectares of biodiverse forestland over a decade, the company has ambitions to plant over 1 million seedlings on 1,000 hectares in 2024 alone.\n \u201cTrees work in groups, like a network,\u201d says Mariani. \u201cThey are social beings and they want to help each other. For different species, their roots go to different depths of the soil so they\u2019re not competing \u2014 they\u2019re cooperating.\u201d\n The Atlantic Forest is situated along South America\u2019s eastern coast, starting in northeastern Brazil and sprawling farther inland as it makes its way down to southeastern Paraguay and northern Argentina. It is just 40 miles wide at its northernmost point and stretches approximately 200 miles inland from its southern Atlantic coastline. After more than 500 years of deforestation, the rainforest has been depleted by 80 percent, with the terrain cultivated as agricultural land for coffee, cacao, sugarcane, and other crops; and used as pastures for livestock. Much of the rainforest has been depleted of its precious hardwoods \u2014 including the brazilwood and Brazilian rosewood used in furniture, construction, and even musical instruments like guitars. Today, similar activity is underway in the Amazon.\n Estimates show the Atlantic Forest has a potential reforestation area of around 40 million hectares, or 100 million acres. Symbiosis\u2019s approach to forestry aims to both create a high-quality sustainable working forest while continuing the fight against climate change with one of the most vital tools for carbon sequestration: nature itself. \u201cWe\u2019re balancing wood production and carbon stocks,\u201d explains Alan Batista, Symbiosis\u2019s chief financial officer who studied forestry and whose career spans plant propagation in the pulp and paper industry, business strategy, economics, and finance.\n \u201cWoody biomass actually creates a lot of carbon stored here, and we know we have a lot of carbon being stored in the soil as well,\u201d Batista says. \u201cSo when it comes to harvesting, we have to think all the way from the beginning to the end of the cycle. The management we\u2019re applying here is continuous cover forest management, meaning we\u2019re going to manage for perpetuity. It\u2019s going to always be covered with forest.\u201d\n To calculate the carbon stored on its land, Symbiosis has integrated Space Intelligence\u2019s satellite data, ecological knowledge, and machine learning to create land cover, land cover change, and forest carbon maps. Satellite data is integrated with readings from the ForestScanner app, which takes field measurements with the LiDAR scanner on iPhone to determine age and growth rate. \u201cThey\u2019re helping us to screen properties and land use \u2014 how much pasture area, forest areas, and retroactive deforestation,\u201d Batista explains.\n Part of the screening process is identifying areas that are designated as land that belongs to Indigenous communities, who Symbiosis hopes to soon partner with on identifying and collecting seeds from mother trees on their lands. After visiting the Amazon in 2007 to see how one Indigenous community reforested an area that had been destroyed by loggers along the Peruvian border, Mariani was inspired.\n \u201cThe leaders were talking to me about climate change and they took me to that place they reforested, and it looked like an original forest,\u201d Mariani recalls. \u201cIt was inspiring to me to see the power of restoration of nature and how traditional knowledge can be combined with science.\u201d\n A little over 1,600 miles southwest of Trancoso, another Restore Fund project is underway at Forestal Apepu in the San Pedro district of Paraguay.\n In this southwestern region of the Atlantic Forest, Forestal Apepu is developing fast-growing eucalyptus forests for high-quality timber production on lands that were deforested decades ago, while protecting the remaining natural forest and planting native species through experimental trials. By focusing on high-quality timber managed on longer growing cycles, Forestal Apepu allows for more carbon removal and longer-term storage on its forestland. They also hope the solid wood products produced from their high-quality timber will alleviate pressures on the natural forest itself, resulting in carbon being stored in long-lived wood products even after a tree is cut.\n A key part of Forestal Apepu\u2019s work extends beyond the borders of the forest: The project is also supporting the local communities through a series of social impact initiatives around the neighboring San Estanislao, Paraguay.\n The landlocked region has depended on the forest for timber, firewood, and their agricultural needs for generations. As part of Apple\u2019s Restore Fund, Forestal Apepu is working with local communities to identify alternate sources of supplemental income that alleviate pressure on the timber forests in the area. These sources include employment in the company\u2019s Forest Stewardship Council-certified eucalyptus farms, land leases through its outgrower model (in which smallholder landowners are given seedlings and technical assistance to grow and manage timber), chicken production through a local women\u2019s association, and yerba mate cultivation.\n Graciela Gimenez has lived in Cururu\u2019o, a small community of roughly 1,200 people, for 40 years. Every morning, she wakes at 5 a.m. to start her daily routine: feeding and changing the water for her chickens, cleaning the house, cooking the family\u2019s meals, and tending to any needs that may arise for the women\u2019s association she helped create and is president of.\n \u201cI\u2019ve always been very present in the community,\u201d Gimenez says. \u201cThey like that I have the power to get things going.\u201d\n After multiple meetings with Forestal Apepu\u2019s social liaison officer, Gladys Nu\u00f1ez, Gimenez and the women of the community came together to develop an income stream from raising chickens. Previously, households had inconsistent income primarily from day laboring on nearby land. After Forestal Apepu added 21 chickens to her coop in 2023, Gimenez now has 51 chickens that produce eggs and meat for the family to eat and also to sell.\n \u201cWe have to take care of our neighbors, who should also be our allies,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. \u201cAll of those people from the communities that are working at Apepu, including myself, we are learning every day about forest management, like the health and safety about pesticides or the better use of natural resources. This learning as a community is going to help the environment.\u201d\n Ramon Mariotti, leader of the Palomita I community who settled in the area in 1962 after drought and devastation in the Chaco region, has been growing yerba mate, an herbal tea that for many Paraguayans is the only substance to quench their thirst, in the area. Mariotti\u2019s father taught him the ins and outs of cultivation, including knowing when the leaves are ready, how delicately they must be picked by hand, how to dry and grind them, and how to determine what\u2019s best to sell.\n \u201cEver since we got here, we realized how rich this land is,\u201d Mariotti says. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a nature supermarket surrounding us: We can plant anything.\u201d\n To help expand their harvest, Mariotti has been working with Forestal Apepu\u2019s Alberto Florent\u00edn to improve their planting process, including knowing when to plant and how close together they should be to one another.\n Florent\u00edn has spent 40 years as a forest engineer traveling throughout Paraguay, first with the forest service, then with the National Parks Center at the Museo Mois\u00e9s Bertoni, a nature preserve where he helped recruit park rangers from the Indigenous communities he was meeting in the area. Florent\u00edn credits the knowledge he gained from his many visits to Paraguay\u2019s various regions with his ability to survive anywhere in the country and help others thrive purely on the land itself.\n \u201cI want to make sure people here can watch things grow and we do not leave a desert for the future generations,\u201d Florent\u00edn says. \u201cWith climate change, things have become more and more difficult \u2014 water sources are getting scarce, and things that grow are more difficult to find. So I want to make sure that they have all the resources in order to keep growing.\u201d\n Beyond its community projects, Forestal Apepu is also looking for ways to monitor the wellbeing of the land in its forested areas.\n A bioacoustic monitoring experiment has been recording the sounds of the forest, helping a partner team of biologists detect the levels of biodiversity throughout the forest using artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n Across Forestal Apepu\u2019s project sites in Paraguay and Symbiosis\u2019s in Brazil, efforts to record, preserve, and revitalize the flora and fauna in each region may seem disconnected, but dig below the surface and they share mutual goals: ensuring the resilience of the most natural places on earth that have for too long been taken for granted.\n As Symbiosis\u2019s Mariani recognized when he first started thinking about his company and ultimately solidified its name, \u201cIt\u2019s the cooperation among different species with mutual benefits \u2014 the opposite of a parasite. What I want to do is symbiosis. It\u2019s a win-win for everybody.\u201d\n"

        "body": "Around the world, developers are building apps that break down barriers across gender, race, socioeconomic status, language, and physical ability.\n In celebration of Entrepreneur Camp\u2019s fifth anniversary, Apple spoke with alumni app creators whose apps are shaking things up in education, fitness, and mental health. All three women have participated in the immersive tech lab that invites developers from underrepresented groups to take their apps to the next level with one-on-one guidance from Apple experts, engineers, and leaders. Entrepreneur Camp underscores Apple\u2019s ethos that apps for everyone should be made by everyone.\n Edna Martinson, a 2023 Entrepreneur Camp alum based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, launched Boddle Learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, when students and teachers were adjusting to the sudden transition to learning from home. The education app for kids uses gameplay and machine learning to tailor content to their learning levels, helping them tackle learning gaps and boost their confidence in the classroom.\n After graduating from MIT, 2022 Entrepreneur Camp alum Jenny Xu founded her own studio and fused two of her lifelong passions \u2014 running and gaming \u2014 into Run Legends. The immersive multiplayer game was designed to make walking and running more fun, encouraging players of all fitness levels to team up with friends to battle and overcome real-life anxieties.\n And Jo Aggarwal, a 2019 Entrepreneur Camp alum, is the founder and CEO of Wysa, an emotionally intelligent chatbot \u2014 written by therapists working with AI designers \u2014 to help users talk through difficult emotions and thoughts anonymously, anytime. Based in Boston and Bengaluru, the app has helped millions of people across 95 countries learn how to feel happier.\n Below, Martinson, Xu, and Aggarwal reflect on their journeys to becoming app developers, how they\u2019ve infused personalization into their apps to make them more accessible to all, key lessons they\u2019ve learned along the way and at Entrepreneur Camp, and how they\u2019ve harnessed technology to craft innovative solutions to real-world problems.\n Jenny Xu (JX): When I started out in the gaming industry, I felt like I was the only one doing what I was doing. I grew up playing a lot of story-based interactive fiction \u2014 artistic games that make you come away having learned something about life, and I think that\u2019s a genre that\u2019s predominantly popular with women. With Run Legends, even though it\u2019s a battle game, it isn\u2019t a game that makes people feel really aggressive when they\u2019re playing it \u2014 they can feel empowered. Now that I\u2019ve raised some money and shipped some games, I try to give back and show that it\u2019s possible to build games that aren\u2019t just shooters, but games that actually make the world a better place.\n Edna Martinson (EM): My perspective as a woman in this field has really shaped our team and how we connect with our community, especially since most elementary school teachers that we serve are women. We\u2019ve had a blast doing virtual career days on Zoom, showing kids how we made Boddle, and introducing them to game design. It\u2019s super rewarding to see the excitement on little girls\u2019 faces when they find out a woman cofounded Boddle. It shows them they can be leaders in tech too.\n Jo Aggarwal (JA): We set out to solve for global mental health and give people a safe space to work through their thoughts and emotions, building resilience irrespective of stigma, race, gender, access to a therapist, or diagnosis\u2026 Language can also be a barrier, and in an effort to make Wysa\u2019s support more inclusive, we are launching Wysa in Spanish to create more equitable access to marginalized communities.\n EM: At Boddle, we understand that every kid learns differently and at their own pace, so we\u2019re using machine learning to tailor content to kids\u2019 levels and help identify learning gaps through fun and interactive\u00a0gameplay. We also provide teachers with the tools to be able to support their students, giving them access to kindergarten through sixth-grade assessments and videos in math and English, and a host of grading and reporting tools.\n JX: We noticed that in other fitness experiences, people who were faster or more fit were often rewarded for how fit they were, so others would be intimidated. Run Legends uses core location, core motion, and accelerometer data on the Apple platform to detect how fast somebody is going and adjust the gameplay based on that. So if you want to play at a 20-minute walking pace or at an eight-minute running pace, it\u2019s all the same. There\u2019s actually no advantage to going faster or slower through our game. There are quite a few walkers who play the game and say that the game\u2019s gotten them to go from walking to eventually going faster and moving up to a jog.\n JA: Entrepreneur Camp was amazing, meeting so many like-minded entrepreneurs and making friends with them. I do stay in touch with some of the cohort who are in similar fields. The campus is so beautifully designed, and to learn Apple design principles within that environment was like a dream come true. We had design sessions with Apple team members who helped us understand how to position Wysa, and today, we are one of the top-ranked apps in our space.\n JX: When we attended Entrepreneur Camp, it was very early on in Run Legends. We didn\u2019t even know necessarily what the game would look like. We got this opportunity to talk to the design team, who knew what was working on the App Store and would do deep dives on our app. One example was our onboarding experience \u2014 our rep told us, \u201cWhat happens if a player isn\u2019t ready to run or go outside? You would lose so many people if you didn\u2019t provide an alternate experience that could be played indoors.\u201d So we changed our entire onboarding flow because of that feedback and realized after launch that almost half of all players used the alternate experience.\n EM: Boddle is more than just a game for math or English. We\u2019re creating a learning\u00a0metaverse with different game\u00a0experiences. If kids love basketball, they can jump into a basketball game. If they\u2019re into pets, they can check out our pet-battling game. The cool part is they get to pick what they want to play, and their learning goes with them wherever they go in Boddle\u2019s world. They\u2019re in charge of their own learning adventure, picking what they want to do and learning along the way.\n JX: In Run Legends, we use Spatial Audio so that when you turn your head, it sounds like the\u00a0battle is actually happening around you. If you turn to the left, you might hear the monster snarling at you, but if you turn right, you could hear your teammates cheering you on. You feel the haptics as you charge up your attack and as you sprint, and you feel like the battle is happening right there. That feeling gets people to work out longer and harder. Players often tell us they\u2019ve done the fastest walks or runs in their entire life through it, and it\u2019s because of that interactive audio experience.\n JA: What has truly been unique about Wysa has been how we iterated the product. We did not start with a clinical workbook and turn it into a chatbot. We took evidence-based techniques that worked, and then listened to users about what they needed and where some didn\u2019t work for them. We then worked with clinicians to create models that worked for users when they tried to help themselves. This created a power balance between users and clinicians, powered by AI and analytics, which had never been possible before.\n JA: We wanted to make access to mental health permissionless \u2014 something you could reach out to on your phone at 3 a.m. and continue to use as often as you needed. Research shows that people are 3x more likely to open up to AI than even a human therapist. This creates an opportunity to create psychological safety, but also must be followed through with privacy-first design and proven, measurable outcomes. We were able to show impact with adolescents as well as older adults with chronic pain, with blue collar workers as well as tech professionals.\n JX: The narrative in Run Legends is that you\u2019re fighting real-world anxieties through your battles in the game. So you\u2019re not fighting a minion or a generic enemy: You\u2019re fighting your critical grandma who\u2019s telling you you\u2019re not good enough, or a hyper-competitive Chad who\u2019s always trying to beat you. We\u2019ve heard our players say it\u2019s a cathartic experience. They\u2019re actually healing from the battles and the narrative of overcoming obstacles.\n"

Based in Boston and Bengaluru, the app has helped millions of people across 95 countries learn how to feel happier.\n Below, Martinson, Xu, and Aggarwal reflect on their journeys to becoming app developers, how they\u2019ve infused personalization into their apps to make them more accessible to all, key lessons they\u2019ve learned along the way and at Entrepreneur Camp, and how they\u2019ve harnessed technology to craft innovative solutions to real-world problems.\n Jenny Xu (JX): When I started out in the gaming industry, I felt like I was the only one doing what I was doing. I grew up playing a lot of story-based interactive fiction \u2014 artistic games that make you come away having learned something about life, and I think that\u2019s a genre that\u2019s predominantly popular with women. With Run Legends, even though it\u2019s a battle game, it isn\u2019t a game that makes people feel really aggressive when they\u2019re playing it \u2014 they can feel empowered. Now that I\u2019ve raised some money and shipped some games, I try to give back and show that it\u2019s possible to build games that aren\u2019t just shooters, but games that actually make the world a better place.\n Edna Martinson (EM): My perspective as a woman in this field has really shaped our team and how we connect with our community, especially since most elementary school teachers that we serve are women. We\u2019ve had a blast doing virtual career days on Zoom, showing kids how we made Boddle, and introducing them to game design. It\u2019s super rewarding to see the excitement on little girls\u2019 faces when they find out a woman cofounded Boddle. It shows them they can be leaders in tech too.\n Jo Aggarwal (JA): We set out to solve for global mental health and give people a safe space to work through their thoughts and emotions, building resilience irrespective of stigma, race, gender, access to a therapist, or diagnosis\u2026 Language can also be a barrier, and in an effort to make Wysa\u2019s support more inclusive, we are launching Wysa in Spanish to create more equitable access to marginalized communities.\n EM: At Boddle, we understand that every kid learns differently and at their own pace, so we\u2019re using machine learning to tailor content to kids\u2019 levels and help identify learning gaps through fun and interactive\u00a0gameplay. We also provide teachers with the tools to be able to support their students, giving them access to kindergarten through sixth-grade assessments and videos in math and English, and a host of grading and reporting tools.\n JX: We noticed that in other fitness experiences, people who were faster or more fit were often rewarded for how fit they were, so others would be intimidated. Run Legends uses core location, core motion, and accelerometer data on the Apple platform to detect how fast somebody is going and adjust the gameplay based on that. So if you want to play at a 20-minute walking pace or at an eight-minute running pace, it\u2019s all the same. There\u2019s actually no advantage to going faster or slower through our game. There are quite a few walkers who play the game and say that the game\u2019s gotten them to go from walking to eventually going faster and moving up to a jog.\n JA: Entrepreneur Camp was amazing, meeting so many like-minded entrepreneurs and making friends with them. I do stay in touch with some of the cohort who are in similar fields. The campus is so beautifully designed, and to learn Apple design principles within that environment was like a dream come true. We had design sessions with Apple team members who helped us understand how to position Wysa, and today, we are one of the top-ranked apps in our space.\n JX: When we attended Entrepreneur Camp, it was very early on in Run Legends. We didn\u2019t even know necessarily what the game would look like. We got this opportunity to talk to the design team, who knew what was working on the App Store and would do deep dives on our app. One example was our onboarding experience \u2014 our rep told us, \u201cWhat happens if a player isn\u2019t ready to run or go outside? You would lose so many people if you didn\u2019t provide an alternate experience that could be played indoors.\u201d So we changed our entire onboarding flow because of that feedback and realized after launch that almost half of all players used the alternate experience.\n EM: Boddle is more than just a game for math or English. We\u2019re creating a learning\u00a0metaverse with different game\u00a0experiences. If kids love basketball, they can jump into a basketball game. If they\u2019re into pets, they can check out our pet-battling game. The cool part is they get to pick what they want to play, and their learning goes with them wherever they go in Boddle\u2019s world. They\u2019re in charge of their own learning adventure, picking what they want to do and learning along the way.\n JX: In Run Legends, we use Spatial Audio so that when you turn your head, it sounds like the\u00a0battle is actually happening around you. If you turn to the left, you might hear the monster snarling at you, but if you turn right, you could hear your teammates cheering you on. You feel the haptics as you charge up your attack and as you sprint, and you feel like the battle is happening right there. That feeling gets people to work out longer and harder. Players often tell us they\u2019ve done the fastest walks or runs in their entire life through it, and it\u2019s because of that interactive audio experience.\n JA: What has truly been unique about Wysa has been how we iterated the product. We did not start with a clinical workbook and turn it into a chatbot. We took evidence-based techniques that worked, and then listened to users about what they needed and where some didn\u2019t work for them. We then worked with clinicians to create models that worked for users when they tried to help themselves. This created a power balance between users and clinicians, powered by AI and analytics, which had never been possible before.\n JA: We wanted to make access to mental health permissionless \u2014 something you could reach out to on your phone at 3 a.m. and continue to use as often as you needed. Research shows that people are 3x more likely to open up to AI than even a human therapist. This creates an opportunity to create psychological safety, but also must be followed through with privacy-first design and proven, measurable outcomes. We were able to show impact with adolescents as well as older adults with chronic pain, with blue collar workers as well as tech professionals.\n JX: The narrative in Run Legends is that you\u2019re fighting real-world anxieties through your battles in the game. So you\u2019re not fighting a minion or a generic enemy: You\u2019re fighting your critical grandma who\u2019s telling you you\u2019re not good enough, or a hyper-competitive Chad who\u2019s always trying to beat you. We\u2019ve heard our players say it\u2019s a cathartic experience. They\u2019re actually healing from the battles and the narrative of overcoming obstacles.\n"

        "body": "Apple\u2019s annual Swift Student Challenge recognizes the best in student coding, and this year, it has added a new category to its ranks. Out of 350 winning submissions, 50 students have been named Distinguished Winners for building app playgrounds that stand out for their innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity. These 50 students have been invited to a three-day in-person experience at Apple Park that includes tailored programming and the special event at this year\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where they\u2019ll join like-minded creators from all over the world.\n \u201cThis year\u2019s winning Swift Student Challenge submissions once again demonstrate the breadth and depth of what is possible when talented young people use coding to make their mark on the world,\u201d said Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. \u201cWe\u2019re also incredibly proud to welcome more outstanding student developers than ever before to Apple Park to connect with our teams and each other as they continue to build apps that will no doubt transform our future for the better.\u201d\n This year\u2019s winners come from all over the globe, representing more than 35 countries and regions. Many of their app playgrounds were sparked by something personal, such as helping people in their community or a favorite hobby. For Distinguished Winners Elena Galluzzo, Dezmond Blair, and Jawaher Shaman, inspiration also came from their families \u2014 and they share the hope that one day, their apps can make an impact on others as well.\n Elena Galluzzo, 22, divides her time between Waterloo, Ontario, where she\u2019s finishing her undergraduate degree at Wilfrid Laurier University, and her family home in the suburbs of Toronto. She shares that home with her parents, her sister, and her maternal grandparents, who were the inspiration for her winning app, Care Capsule.\n \u201cMy grandmother is in the late stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and requires full-time care,\u201d says Galluzzo. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also hard on my grandfather because it can be quite lonely \u2014 even though he lives with his children and grandchildren, a lot of older people don\u2019t. Canada has an aging population, so I think it\u2019s really important to keep looking into ways we can help people in this field, and coding is one way I can contribute.\u201d\n Galluzzo designed Care Capsule to be an all-in-one assistant for elderly people. She used Apple\u2019s machine learning framework Create ML to build a chatbot that analyzes interactions with the user to deduce whether they are experiencing loneliness or depression. The app also lets users track their medications, connect with community resources, and keep a record of positive memories.\n After Galluzzo graduates with a degree in business this spring, she hopes to publish Care Capsule on the App Store, potentially incorporating what she learns when she attends WWDC24 in June.\n \u201cBeing able to meet other people who have the same passion as I do is very exciting,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m also really looking forward to seeing what new frameworks are coming out and how I could use them. I think it\u2019s very cool to be able to create something that can tap into your device\u2019s native functionality and help solve important challenges at the same time.\u201d\n Dezmond Blair, 22, grew up in Canton, Michigan, and spent a lot of his time outdoors mountain biking with his little brother. His family had a secondhand computer, but they couldn\u2019t afford to connect it to the internet.\n \u201cAfter growing up in a trailer park, it became really important for me to make sure that I was keeping up on all my grades because my parents told me when I was young, \u2018You\u2019re definitely not ending up like we were,\u2019\u201d says Blair. \u201cThey spent a lot of their life trying to make sure that I wouldn\u2019t have to struggle the same way they did, and so that\u2019s where my inspiration and my passion comes from.\u201d\n He worked hard in high school and discovered he had a knack for technology, eventually getting his associate\u2019s degree in computer programming. Last year, Blair started at the Apple Developer Academy in Detroit, where he was introduced to Apple\u2019s coding language Swift. With it, he created his winning iPad app called MTB XTREME, which puts users behind the handlebars of a mountain bike, offering a 360-degree view of the trails around them. Eventually, Blair wants to release an even more immersive version for Apple Vision Pro.\n In addition to working on his own apps, Blair recently started his own company that helps to design app prototypes, which he cleverly named Easy Dez It \u2014 though his most important goal for the future comes back to his parents.\n \u201cI want to end up buying them a house one day,\u201d says Blair. \u201cThey\u2019ve done so much for me and my little brother, so I have to pay it forward.\u201d\n Growing up in Saudi Arabia, Jawaher Shaman was very close to her grandfather. When she was 5, he passed away, and soon after, she developed a stutter that became debilitating. Over time, and with the help of her father, she was able to learn ways to manage it and no longer stutters. Now 27 and studying at the Apple Developer Academy in Riyadh, Shaman\u2019s winning app playground, My Child, aims to help others with speech conditions.\n \u201cMy father never made me feel different, and I hope my app will do the same for any child or young person who suffers from stuttering,\u201d says Shaman. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to ever feel like stuttering is a hurdle they can\u2019t overcome.\u201d\n My Child tells Shaman\u2019s story through the eyes of a child who stutters, and features characters inspired by her father and grandfather. The app guides users through exercises that help slow down their breathing and prepare them for real-life experiences like reading a story in class. Shaman used AVFAudio to add sounds that mimic the way her father would break sentences into small, more manageable parts.\n After graduation, Shaman will work as a programmer in Saudi Arabia, and she also wants to publish My Child on the App Store and continue creating apps that assist others.\n \u201cI hope to use technology to help children who are neurodivergent because I know what it\u2019s like to feel different,\u201d says Shaman. \u201cCoding for me opened up a world of possibilities, and it brings me one step closer to achieving my goals, which are to help people and create a lasting impact.\u201d\n Apple is proud to champion the next generation of developers, creators, and entrepreneurs through its annual WWDC student program. Over the past four decades, thousands of students from all over the world have built successful careers, founded businesses, and created organizations focused on democratizing technology and using it to build a better future.\n"

        "body": "Driving along Ocean Avenue around 3:30 a.m. on a cool Friday morning in March, most of Santa Monica is perfectly quiet and still. But as the car approaches Colorado Avenue, a low din of voices begins to build. Every block, it grows louder and louder, until suddenly its source becomes clear, illuminated beneath the blazing neon at the entrance to the city\u2019s iconic pier.\n Hundreds of people have gathered here for the start of The Speed Project, an annual relay event that attracts brave souls from all over the world. The energy is electric: Team RVs covered with DIY signage line the street, massive flags ripple in the wind, and a drone flies overhead, casting an otherworldly glow on the undulating crowd. As the clock strikes 4 a.m., the teams scatter off in every direction.\n Members of Los Angeles\u2019s Koreatown Run Club (KRC) and New York City\u2019s Old Man Run Club (OMRC) have been training for this day for months, joining forces from their respective coasts to take on the grueling 300-plus-mile route through the Mojave Desert to Las Vegas. There are no rules, no support stations, no spectators, no rain delays \u2014 just the runners, their navigators, their crew, and the open road. And that\u2019s a big part of the appeal.\n Through it all \u2014 the rugged landscape, the sleep deprivation, the dehydration, the extreme temperatures, and the pouring rain \u2014 Apple Watch Ultra 2 was an essential companion, offering the 12-member team the ability to instantly keep tabs on each others\u2019 locations, take hands-free calls, keep an eye on their pace, provide visibility in the darkness, and view their elevation.\n \u201cApple Watch Ultra 2 was our instant lifeline to each other,\u201d says Cindy Le, the team\u2019s veteran navigator and crew captain \u2014 a sentiment echoed by cocaptain Ja Tecson.\n \u201cThe watch is truly made for the conditions we were going through, especially when we did our trail runs at night,\u201d Tecson adds.\n Made from aerospace-grade titanium, Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple\u2019s most capable and rugged watch, with the best battery life of any Apple Watch, advanced running metrics, easy-to-read Workout Views, a range of training experiences, and Apple\u2019s brightest display.\n The team\u2019s photographers \u2014 A.J.

        "body": "In South America\u2019s Atlantic Forest, many suggest that life depends on a mother: the superior matriarch who provides for all. This is true for its plants and animals, and even the trees that tower above, reaching skyward to the sun while providing shade for the life that resides in their underbrush.\n It is estimated there are 5,000 tree species in existence in the Atlantic Forest today. Of those species, two-thirds are threatened with extinction after centuries of exploitative, extractive practices. Restoring the rainforest \u2014 a potential 100 million-acre restoration area in Brazil alone \u2014 has been at the core of Apple-supported projects in the region, including one just inland from the coastal town of Trancoso in Bahia, Brazil, where one company is cultivating seedlings from mother trees, the most resilient trees from multiple species that have survived the rainforest\u2019s destruction.\n \u201cWe started with the best genetic material possible, harvested in a huge native reserve of the Atlantic rainforest,\u201d explains Bruno Mariani, forest management and investment company Symbiosis\u2019s founder and CEO. \u201cThat would attract a lot of fauna and insects.\u201d\n Founded in 2008, Symbiosis has been collecting, banking, and planting seeds from mother trees of various Brazilian native species since 2010. \u201cThe mother tree represents the nature that provides us all the energy and the basis for restoration, so the mother tree gives us all,\u201d says Mickael Mello, Symbiosis\u2019s plant nursery manager.\n Symbiosis is one of three investments that are part of Apple\u2019s Restore Fund, announced in 2021 with the goal of scaling nature-based solutions to address climate change. In partnership with Goldman Sachs and Conservation International, the Restore Fund has invested in three carbon removal projects across Brazil and Paraguay with the aim of delivering benefits that go far beyond carbon \u2014 from strengthening local livelihoods to enhancing biodiversity.\n Since their first planting, which consisted of 160 different species spread across an area that will be permanently protected from wood harvesting, Symbiosis has expanded its restoration of threatened native trees. In its efforts to decrease biodiversity loss, Symbiosis has committed to conserving 40 percent of its land with natural, multispecies forests, while the remaining land supplies precious tropical hardwoods from responsibly managed sources. After planting 800 hectares of biodiverse forestland over a decade, the company has ambitions to plant over 1 million seedlings on 1,000 hectares in 2024 alone.\n \u201cTrees work in groups, like a network,\u201d says Mariani. \u201cThey are social beings and they want to help each other. For different species, their roots go to different depths of the soil so they\u2019re not competing \u2014 they\u2019re cooperating.\u201d\n The Atlantic Forest is situated along South America\u2019s eastern coast, starting in northeastern Brazil and sprawling farther inland as it makes its way down to southeastern Paraguay and northern Argentina. It is just 40 miles wide at its northernmost point and stretches approximately 200 miles inland from its southern Atlantic coastline. After more than 500 years of deforestation, the rainforest has been depleted by 80 percent, with the terrain cultivated as agricultural land for coffee, cacao, sugarcane, and other crops; and used as pastures for livestock. Much of the rainforest has been depleted of its precious hardwoods \u2014 including the brazilwood and Brazilian rosewood used in furniture, construction, and even musical instruments like guitars. Today, similar activity is underway in the Amazon.\n Estimates show the Atlantic Forest has a potential reforestation area of around 40 million hectares, or 100 million acres. Symbiosis\u2019s approach to forestry aims to both create a high-quality sustainable working forest while continuing the fight against climate change with one of the most vital tools for carbon sequestration: nature itself. \u201cWe\u2019re balancing wood production and carbon stocks,\u201d explains Alan Batista, Symbiosis\u2019s chief financial officer who studied forestry and whose career spans plant propagation in the pulp and paper industry, business strategy, economics, and finance.\n \u201cWoody biomass actually creates a lot of carbon stored here, and we know we have a lot of carbon being stored in the soil as well,\u201d Batista says. \u201cSo when it comes to harvesting, we have to think all the way from the beginning to the end of the cycle. The management we\u2019re applying here is continuous cover forest management, meaning we\u2019re going to manage for perpetuity. It\u2019s going to always be covered with forest.\u201d\n To calculate the carbon stored on its land, Symbiosis has integrated Space Intelligence\u2019s satellite data, ecological knowledge, and machine learning to create land cover, land cover change, and forest carbon maps. Satellite data is integrated with readings from the ForestScanner app, which takes field measurements with the LiDAR scanner on iPhone to determine age and growth rate. \u201cThey\u2019re helping us to screen properties and land use \u2014 how much pasture area, forest areas, and retroactive deforestation,\u201d Batista explains.\n Part of the screening process is identifying areas that are designated as land that belongs to Indigenous communities, who Symbiosis hopes to soon partner with on identifying and collecting seeds from mother trees on their lands. After visiting the Amazon in 2007 to see how one Indigenous community reforested an area that had been destroyed by loggers along the Peruvian border, Mariani was inspired.\n \u201cThe leaders were talking to me about climate change and they took me to that place they reforested, and it looked like an original forest,\u201d Mariani recalls. \u201cIt was inspiring to me to see the power of restoration of nature and how traditional knowledge can be combined with science.\u201d\n A little over 1,600 miles southwest of Trancoso, another Restore Fund project is underway at Forestal Apepu in the San Pedro district of Paraguay.\n In this southwestern region of the Atlantic Forest, Forestal Apepu is developing fast-growing eucalyptus forests for high-quality timber production on lands that were deforested decades ago, while protecting the remaining natural forest and planting native species through experimental trials. By focusing on high-quality timber managed on longer growing cycles, Forestal Apepu allows for more carbon removal and longer-term storage on its forestland. They also hope the solid wood products produced from their high-quality timber will alleviate pressures on the natural forest itself, resulting in carbon being stored in long-lived wood products even after a tree is cut.\n A key part of Forestal Apepu\u2019s work extends beyond the borders of the forest: The project is also supporting the local communities through a series of social impact initiatives around the neighboring San Estanislao, Paraguay.\n The landlocked region has depended on the forest for timber, firewood, and their agricultural needs for generations. As part of Apple\u2019s Restore Fund, Forestal Apepu is working with local communities to identify alternate sources of supplemental income that alleviate pressure on the timber forests in the area. These sources include employment in the company\u2019s Forest Stewardship Council-certified eucalyptus farms, land leases through its outgrower model (in which smallholder landowners are given seedlings and technical assistance to grow and manage timber), chicken production through a local women\u2019s association, and yerba mate cultivation.\n Graciela Gimenez has lived in Cururu\u2019o, a small community of roughly 1,200 people, for 40 years. Every morning, she wakes at 5 a.m. to start her daily routine: feeding and changing the water for her chickens, cleaning the house, cooking the family\u2019s meals, and tending to any needs that may arise for the women\u2019s association she helped create and is president of.\n \u201cI\u2019ve always been very present in the community,\u201d Gimenez says. \u201cThey like that I have the power to get things going.\u201d\n After multiple meetings with Forestal Apepu\u2019s social liaison officer, Gladys Nu\u00f1ez, Gimenez and the women of the community came together to develop an income stream from raising chickens. Previously, households had inconsistent income primarily from day laboring on nearby land. After Forestal Apepu added 21 chickens to her coop in 2023, Gimenez now has 51 chickens that produce eggs and meat for the family to eat and also to sell.\n \u201cWe have to take care of our neighbors, who should also be our allies,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. \u201cAll of those people from the communities that are working at Apepu, including myself, we are learning every day about forest management, like the health and safety about pesticides or the better use of natural resources. This learning as a community is going to help the environment.\u201d\n Ramon Mariotti, leader of the Palomita I community who settled in the area in 1962 after drought and devastation in the Chaco region, has been growing yerba mate, an herbal tea that for many Paraguayans is the only substance to quench their thirst, in the area. Mariotti\u2019s father taught him the ins and outs of cultivation, including knowing when the leaves are ready, how delicately they must be picked by hand, how to dry and grind them, and how to determine what\u2019s best to sell.\n \u201cEver since we got here, we realized how rich this land is,\u201d Mariotti says. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a nature supermarket surrounding us: We can plant anything.\u201d\n To help expand their harvest, Mariotti has been working with Forestal Apepu\u2019s Alberto Florent\u00edn to improve their planting process, including knowing when to plant and how close together they should be to one another.\n Florent\u00edn has spent 40 years as a forest engineer traveling throughout Paraguay, first with the forest service, then with the National Parks Center at the Museo Mois\u00e9s Bertoni, a nature preserve where he helped recruit park rangers from the Indigenous communities he was meeting in the area. Florent\u00edn credits the knowledge he gained from his many visits to Paraguay\u2019s various regions with his ability to survive anywhere in the country and help others thrive purely on the land itself.\n \u201cI want to make sure people here can watch things grow and we do not leave a desert for the future generations,\u201d Florent\u00edn says. \u201cWith climate change, things have become more and more difficult \u2014 water sources are getting scarce, and things that grow are more difficult to find. So I want to make sure that they have all the resources in order to keep growing.\u201d\n Beyond its community projects, Forestal Apepu is also looking for ways to monitor the wellbeing of the land in its forested areas.\n A bioacoustic monitoring experiment has been recording the sounds of the forest, helping a partner team of biologists detect the levels of biodiversity throughout the forest using artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n Across Forestal Apepu\u2019s project sites in Paraguay and Symbiosis\u2019s in Brazil, efforts to record, preserve, and revitalize the flora and fauna in each region may seem disconnected, but dig below the surface and they share mutual goals: ensuring the resilience of the most natural places on earth that have for too long been taken for granted.\n As Symbiosis\u2019s Mariani recognized when he first started thinking about his company and ultimately solidified its name, \u201cIt\u2019s the cooperation among different species with mutual benefits \u2014 the opposite of a parasite. What I want to do is symbiosis. It\u2019s a win-win for everybody.\u201d\n"

        "body": "Around the world, developers are building apps that break down barriers across gender, race, socioeconomic status, language, and physical ability.\n In celebration of Entrepreneur Camp\u2019s fifth anniversary, Apple spoke with alumni app creators whose apps are shaking things up in education, fitness, and mental health. All three women have participated in the immersive tech lab that invites developers from underrepresented groups to take their apps to the next level with one-on-one guidance from Apple experts, engineers, and leaders. Entrepreneur Camp underscores Apple\u2019s ethos that apps for everyone should be made by everyone.\n Edna Martinson, a 2023 Entrepreneur Camp alum based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, launched Boddle Learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, when students and teachers were adjusting to the sudden transition to learning from home. The education app for kids uses gameplay and machine learning to tailor content to their learning levels, helping them tackle learning gaps and boost their confidence in the classroom.\n After graduating from MIT, 2022 Entrepreneur Camp alum Jenny Xu founded her own studio and fused two of her lifelong passions \u2014 running and gaming \u2014 into Run Legends. The immersive multiplayer game was designed to make walking and running more fun, encouraging players of all fitness levels to team up with friends to battle and overcome real-life anxieties.\n And Jo Aggarwal, a 2019 Entrepreneur Camp alum, is the founder and CEO of Wysa, an emotionally intelligent chatbot \u2014 written by therapists working with AI designers \u2014 to help users talk through difficult emotions and thoughts anonymously, anytime. Based in Boston and Bengaluru, the app has helped millions of people across 95 countries learn how to feel happier.\n Below, Martinson, Xu, and Aggarwal reflect on their journeys to becoming app developers, how they\u2019ve infused personalization into their apps to make them more accessible to all, key lessons they\u2019ve learned along the way and at Entrepreneur Camp, and how they\u2019ve harnessed technology to craft innovative solutions to real-world problems.\n Jenny Xu (JX): When I started out in the gaming industry, I felt like I was the only one doing what I was doing. I grew up playing a lot of story-based interactive fiction \u2014 artistic games that make you come away having learned something about life, and I think that\u2019s a genre that\u2019s predominantly popular with women. With Run Legends, even though it\u2019s a battle game, it isn\u2019t a game that makes people feel really aggressive when they\u2019re playing it \u2014 they can feel empowered. Now that I\u2019ve raised some money and shipped some games, I try to give back and show that it\u2019s possible to build games that aren\u2019t just shooters, but games that actually make the world a better place.\n Edna Martinson (EM): My perspective as a woman in this field has really shaped our team and how we connect with our community, especially since most elementary school teachers that we serve are women. We\u2019ve had a blast doing virtual career days on Zoom, showing kids how we made Boddle, and introducing them to game design. It\u2019s super rewarding to see the excitement on little girls\u2019 faces when they find out a woman cofounded Boddle. It shows them they can be leaders in tech too.\n Jo Aggarwal (JA): We set out to solve for global mental health and give people a safe space to work through their thoughts and emotions, building resilience irrespective of stigma, race, gender, access to a therapist, or diagnosis\u2026 Language can also be a barrier, and in an effort to make Wysa\u2019s support more inclusive, we are launching Wysa in Spanish to create more equitable access to marginalized communities.\n EM: At Boddle, we understand that every kid learns differently and at their own pace, so we\u2019re using machine learning to tailor content to kids\u2019 levels and help identify learning gaps through fun and interactive\u00a0gameplay. We also provide teachers with the tools to be able to support their students, giving them access to kindergarten through sixth-grade assessments and videos in math and English, and a host of grading and reporting tools.\n JX: We noticed that in other fitness experiences, people who were faster or more fit were often rewarded for how fit they were, so others would be intimidated. Run Legends uses core location, core motion, and accelerometer data on the Apple platform to detect how fast somebody is going and adjust the gameplay based on that. So if you want to play at a 20-minute walking pace or at an eight-minute running pace, it\u2019s all the same. There\u2019s actually no advantage to going faster or slower through our game. There are quite a few walkers who play the game and say that the game\u2019s gotten them to go from walking to eventually going faster and moving up to a jog.\n JA: Entrepreneur Camp was amazing, meeting so many like-minded entrepreneurs and making friends with them. I do stay in touch with some of the cohort who are in similar fields. The campus is so beautifully designed, and to learn Apple design principles within that environment was like a dream come true. We had design sessions with Apple team members who helped us understand how to position Wysa, and today, we are one of the top-ranked apps in our space.\n JX: When we attended Entrepreneur Camp, it was very early on in Run Legends. We didn\u2019t even know necessarily what the game would look like. We got this opportunity to talk to the design team, who knew what was working on the App Store and would do deep dives on our app. One example was our onboarding experience \u2014 our rep told us, \u201cWhat happens if a player isn\u2019t ready to run or go outside? You would lose so many people if you didn\u2019t provide an alternate experience that could be played indoors.\u201d So we changed our entire onboarding flow because of that feedback and realized after launch that almost half of all players used the alternate experience.\n EM: Boddle is more than just a game for math or English. We\u2019re creating a learning\u00a0metaverse with different game\u00a0experiences. If kids love basketball, they can jump into a basketball game. If they\u2019re into pets, they can check out our pet-battling game. The cool part is they get to pick what they want to play, and their learning goes with them wherever they go in Boddle\u2019s world. They\u2019re in charge of their own learning adventure, picking what they want to do and learning along the way.\n JX: In Run Legends, we use Spatial Audio so that when you turn your head, it sounds like the\u00a0battle is actually happening around you. If you turn to the left, you might hear the monster snarling at you, but if you turn right, you could hear your teammates cheering you on. You feel the haptics as you charge up your attack and as you sprint, and you feel like the battle is happening right there. That feeling gets people to work out longer and harder. Players often tell us they\u2019ve done the fastest walks or runs in their entire life through it, and it\u2019s because of that interactive audio experience.\n JA: What has truly been unique about Wysa has been how we iterated the product. We did not start with a clinical workbook and turn it into a chatbot. We took evidence-based techniques that worked, and then listened to users about what they needed and where some didn\u2019t work for them. We then worked with clinicians to create models that worked for users when they tried to help themselves. This created a power balance between users and clinicians, powered by AI and analytics, which had never been possible before.\n JA: We wanted to make access to mental health permissionless \u2014 something you could reach out to on your phone at 3 a.m. and continue to use as often as you needed. Research shows that people are 3x more likely to open up to AI than even a human therapist. This creates an opportunity to create psychological safety, but also must be followed through with privacy-first design and proven, measurable outcomes. We were able to show impact with adolescents as well as older adults with chronic pain, with blue collar workers as well as tech professionals.\n JX: The narrative in Run Legends is that you\u2019re fighting real-world anxieties through your battles in the game. So you\u2019re not fighting a minion or a generic enemy: You\u2019re fighting your critical grandma who\u2019s telling you you\u2019re not good enough, or a hyper-competitive Chad who\u2019s always trying to beat you. We\u2019ve heard our players say it\u2019s a cathartic experience. They\u2019re actually healing from the battles and the narrative of overcoming obstacles.\n"
