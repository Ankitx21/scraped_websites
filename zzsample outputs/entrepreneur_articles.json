        "body": "Entrepreneurial dreams are only far-fetched until they come true. This proved true for Think Greek, a family-owned Greek restaurant in Port St. Lucie, Florida, that started as a food truck and has since won \"Best Bite\" on Food Network's Best Bite in Town. General manager Rosanne Leo attributes the restaurant's success to focusing on providing authentic Greek recipes and a distinctive Greek fusion menu. \"We are first-generation Greek Americans, so we knew when we started the food truck in 2014 that is what we wanted to do,\" she says. \"But we didn't want to [just] do regular Greek food. We wanted to incorporate a fusion menu, coming up with different items that people haven't heard of before.\" When South Beach Wine & Food Festival asked Think Greek to participate in 2020, the team immediately knew their original fusion menu item, Gyropitakia (Greek wontons), would be a hit. Their hunch was correct, and they won the title of \"Best Bite on the Beach.\" Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Leo. \"It was just an incredible feeling because this is something that we came up with,\" Leo says. \"It wasn't anybody else's recipe. It was [us] brainstorming one day on the food truck.\" The following year, Think Greek returned and won again, helping it solidify its reputation for tastiness and consistency. Earlier this year, Think Greek participated in another cooking show, but the stakes were even higher this time. Food Network contacted Leo to be on the first season of Best Bite in Town, a spin-off of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with celebrity chef Guy Fieri. \"This was our dream to be on Food Network, but more specifically, we wanted to be on Triple D\u2026 I was so excited,\" Leo shared. Related: Guy Fieri, Cable's Highest-Paid Chef, Hopes to Save His Industry With 'Restaurant Reboot' The show's premise involved Fieri sending three people to a town to try two dishes from six different local restaurants, ultimately choosing one \"Best Bite\" in that town. The dishes were judged based on capability, presentation and taste. Think Greek won \"Best Bite\" of Port St. Lucie and then went on to win \"Best Bite in Town\" during the show's finale with its Gyropitakia. The judges explained that they'd never eaten anything like Gyropitakia before, leading to Think Greek's win. The dish's novelty and creativity set the local restaurant apart, a huge testament to the family-owned business's efforts. \"That really made us feel all the hard work, energy, brainstorming and everything is working and is paying off,\" Leo says. \"Sometimes, as a family-owned business and as a mom-and-pop, you get overlooked a little bit, and it's disheartening. But to hear that our efforts are not being ignored really does give us that energy to keep working.\" Related: Guy Fieri Is Insanely Busy. Here's How He Gets It All Done. With new attention from the TV show and increased media visibility came many comments from customers and viewers. Leo says that scrolling social media to see the latest feedback sometimes becomes overwhelming. She decided to take it day by day and hold space for both positive and critical reviews. \"You can't please everybody, and that's okay. Some comments are less than nice, and that's fine,\" Leo says. \"Everybody's entitled to their opinion. All I know is that we're trying our best, and we're putting out the food the way we put out our food.\" Leo's willingness to take risks and seize big opportunities, such as being featured on a TV show, has elevated Think Greek's brand. Over time, her persistence helped establish the restaurant's positive reputation. Her advice for business owners seeking this kind of success is to stay consistent with their creative efforts and values and use social media to engage their audiences and uncover feedback for improving operations. She also encourages business owners to believe in themselves and what they can achieve. \u200a\"Sometimes I'm just like, wow, I can't believe it,\" she says. \"But people should never say never. Anything is possible. Some days, you want to give up, but keep going because this is your baby. This is your dream. This is your opportunity to show what you're made of.\" For over a decade, Think Greek has stood by these simple \u2014 but crucial \u2014 tools for success: Subscribe to Behind the Review for more from new business owners and reviewers every Thursday.

In a July interview with TODAY, Galloway defined wealth as bringing in more passive income than what you burn through. So being wealthy doesn't mean hitting a set dollar amount, but rather an amount that gives you what you need to feel the absence of economic stress. Related: This Is 'the Greatest Skill You Can Develop' for Entrepreneurship, Says Professor Scott Galloway To get to that point, Galloway says to \"find your talent, not follow your passion\" from an early age. \"Anyone who tells you to find your passion or follow your passion is already rich,\" he stated. \"You want to be thoughtful about doing something [where] you can be in the top ten or top one percent\u2026 Fulfillment comes from mastery.\" Galloway gave the example of tax law.

Mastery leads to passion, he said.Scott Galloway. (Photo by Tobias Hase/Picture Alliance via Getty Images) Galloway also recently weighed in on what qualities are needed for someone to become a successful entrepreneur. He said that entrepreneurship isn't for everyone, because starting a business requires certain traits like risk-aggressiveness. These \"are certain attributes that most people don't have,\" he said.

Esten is the chief marketing officer at Toast, the innovative restaurant point of sale and management system company. Since joining the team, she has played a significant role in building Toast's customer-focused reputation. When it comes to marketing, she knows the goal is to keep it real. \"Something we always try to remember is the person on the other side of the marketing email or the ad and how we're trying to reach them,\" Esten says. \"It's much more impactful and authentic when a restaurant can say, 'Hey, here's how I'm using Toast, and here's my story,' than what we can say.\" Related: He Founded a Groundbreaking Employee Management Tool in the Back of a Sandwich Shop. A Decade Later, His Company Has 1 Million Users. Esten remembers her first day at Toast very well. It was 2017, and Toast's offices were located in an incubator near Fenway Park in Boston. \"Job No. 1 was 'do no harm,'\" she remembers. \"Learn what's working, make sure that we're building on that early success we had. Really building alongside restaurants is what made us so successful.\" As Toast took off as a company, it started to take up more space. There were desks everywhere, Esten remembers, and the makeshift decor and mismatched carpet made it evident that the company was firmly in growth mode. \"Things have changed a lot since those early days, but it's been an amazing journey,\" she says. Her expectation from the first day was to come in and contribute to what the team had been building. It was \u2014 as with many start-ups \u2014 an \"all hands on deck\" scenario. \"I'll always remember those first couple weeks,\" she says. \"Toast was growing really fast; it was getting a lot of traction with restaurants at that time, and we definitely had product/market fit. Restaurants were using our point of sale across the country, and things were going really well.\" She found her footing under the tutelage of Toast's former CMO, Kevin Hamilton, and Toast CEO and co-founder Aman Narang. Esten attributes much of her professional growth to their mentorship. \"Kevin Hamilton was a huge mentor of mine, someone who taught me a lot about marketing, but also leadership and gave me opportunities to learn and grow,\" she tells Shawn Walchef of Cali BBQ Media during a tour of the company's new Boston headquarters, which opened in 2024. Esten built on the legacy set by her mentors by enhancing Toast's customer-focused marketing efforts. Her philosophy involves actively listening to customer feedback and allowing them to share their own stories. When she started at Toast, the marketing department had about a dozen people; now, it has more than 200. Its focus then, as it is now, was helping independent restaurants. \"A lot of what we're doing today dates back to those early days of Toast marketing as well,\" she says. Related: She Started Sharing Her Kids' Lunches on TikTok in 2020 \u2014 And Now Has 5.6 Million Followers. Here's the 'Aha Moment' That Convinced Her to Start. One of Esten's most notable achievements at Toast is the successful launch of the Toast Now app. She attributes the product's success to its development in close collaboration with Toast partners, which resulted in a cloud-based solution that resonated strongly with the restaurant community. This deep involvement led to widespread daily use and made Toast Now one of the most significant product launches in the company's history. \"One of the things that was really rewarding for me to see is that we actually launched a video alongside it about how it was built because it was built with our customers,\" she shares. Esten's approach to marketing and leadership at Toast highlights the importance of customer engagement, mentorship and collaborative product development. Her commitment to understanding and addressing customer needs has driven successful product launches and fostered a culture of growth and inspiration within her team. \"When I think about my role as a leader now in Toast, that's a lot of the job\u2014how do you get the right people, set them up for success and help them grow their careers?\" she says. \"Because that's what inspires people to do great work.\" Disclaimer: Restaurant Influencers host Shawn Walchef is a paid consultant and content creator for Toast.

        "body": "True story: Recently, my daughter was at a major brand car dealership with her boyfriend, intending to purchase a pre-owned car. Note I made up the numbers for the sake of my daughter's financial privacy, but the takeaways are still the same. The dealership asked for, let's say, $26,000 \"all in\" for the car, but my daughter had already decided that $20,000 was the most she would pay. There was a lot of ground to cover to actually make a deal happen. After some discussion, the salesperson did his best, dropping the price to $25,000. But that still left a big gap, so he told her, \"Let me go check with my manager and see if he has any ideas.\" After five minutes, the salesperson and his manager entered the room together. The manager explained that at $25,000, this was a great price; it was already well below their MSRP, and the deal was \"very thin\" as it was for him. He then used the famous line, \"Okay, here's what I'm going to do to get you into this car today.\" The manager pulled out a piece of paper with revised numbers that showed his price now at $23,995. He explained to my daughter that this was the absolute best possible price. He was \"all in;\" this was his \"best offer,\" and he told her to take it or leave it. For the grand finale \u2014 keeping in mind that this is a 100% true story \u2014 the manager took out a big red ink stamp and smacked it down on the paper. The stamp read \"FINAL\" in bold red ink. $23,995. FINAL. My daughter responded, \"Thanks, but I'm sorry; it looks like it's not going to work out.\" Without hesitation, he immediately blurted out, \"How about $22,500?\" When my daughter told me the story, I had a wonderful laugh. After the big show, the manager held his price for a full six seconds. And the idea of the red final stamp just made the story even better. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized there's actually quite a lot to unpack here regarding sales tactics, psychology and effectiveness. Related: 3 Unconventional Sales Tactics That Will Close More Deals I'm not in the car business, and I've never sold cars, but I can see some familiar sales tactics (and mistakes) playing out here: All this went down after my daughter had spent hours on the lot. It was getting late in the day on a Saturday, and the manager knew she was hoping to get it done. At some level, the manager was wearing her down and playing out the clock, playing the \"waiting game.\" It didn't work in this case, but often, this notion of using time as a weapon can be very effective. Utilizing time as a strategic element in the negotiation process can be effective, but it must be used carefully and respectfully. Pushing too hard on time constraints can backfire. When the salesperson reached his personal negotiation line or felt he would lose her, he brought in his manager. In addition to adding some time to the clock, this step created a new opportunity for a new dynamic. The dealership never really wants a potential buyer to walk out the door, so if one person doesn't get the job done, it's always worth trying someone else. Involving a manager or company administrator in the negotiation process can create new dynamics and opportunities for closing a deal. Although I laughed hysterically when I heard about the red stamp, I soon realized it was actually a smart move. Once upon a time, I'm guessing some sales and marketing people sat in a room, and someone said, \"I have an idea \u2014 let's make a red stamp that says final and use that during negotiations.\" Everyone probably laughed, and they would have said, \"No, I'm serious!\" And then everyone thought about it and agreed, as funny of an idea as it was, it actually made sense. It's one thing to tell someone something verbally, but when it's \"official\" and in red ink on paper, it's human nature to believe it and take it as indisputable. Using psychological sales tactics to create a Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) effect, such as a \"Final Offer\" stamp, can be effective in conveying seriousness and finality, but you have to honor your word, or you will likely lose credibility. All the tactics I outlined above were smart, but here's where I think the dealership dropped the ball: The manager came in cold, and rather than take some time (again, time is on their side) to talk about the value, create some alignment, and build some rapport, he went straight for the kill. That tactic may work, but I felt it was too aggressive. He would have been better off discussing the pain points and goals concerning the product, coming up with some extra incentives, etc. Understanding the customer's needs, discussing the product's value and building rapport and trust can be crucial in successful sales. Related: How to Master Your Sales Success \u2014 Why Every Answer and Rejection Matters The manager decided to go for the close in a fairly aggressive way. In some cases, that tactic makes sense. But he played it all wrong with the numbers. He knew they were a full $5,000 or 20% off, and he decided to put it all on the line at $23,995. Obviously, given how fast he dropped another thousand, he had plenty more room. If he was going for the hard close and \"FINAL\" offer, he should have made it more compelling. By putting on the big show and then immediately dropping his price, he completely lost credibility and lowered the odds of closing. In this case, he lost my daughter's trust and the sale. In negotiation, it's important to understand the other party's budget and limits before making an offer. Being aware of their constraints will increase the likelihood of closing a deal. If you offer something of value at a good price and tell them it's \"final\" (which I personally don't recommend as a sales tactic), then stand by it and mean it. Your word has to mean something. Once he realized his \"final\" price was not going to work, rather than lower it, he could have thrown in some additional valuable incentive, perhaps some amount of free service or some kind of special financing. If a \"final offer\" is presented, standing by it as your final word is essential. If adjustments are needed, they should include additional incentives or value to maintain trust and credibility. Sales is an art, no doubt about that. A great salesperson builds a relationship, asks questions and listens, understands the client's pain points, is honest and transparent, and operates with integrity. Of course, strategies, techniques, incentives, and a lot of human emotion and psychology are at play, but all of them can happen successfully without losing your credibility. So, the overall moral of my story? Choose wisely before using the big red stamp!  "

Swimmer Michael Phelps, who competed in five Olympic Games spanning Sydney 2000 to Rio 2016, is the most decorated Olympian in history with 28 medals, and Simone Biles is the most decorated gymnast in U.S. history, earning an \"unprecedented\" four gold medals in the floor exercise, vault, all-around and team segments at the Rio Games. Now, the Paris 2024 Olympics are underway, and although Phelps is retired \u2014 passing the proverbial torch to Katie Ledecky, who might leave the City of Lights as the most decorated female Olympic swimmer of all time \u2014 Biles is competing again, four years after she withdrew from the Tokyo Olympics and began an important dialogue about athletes' mental health. Image Credit: Tom Weller/VOIGT | Getty Images Over the years, we've celebrated these athletes for their inspiring physical and mental triumphs, but there's another story that should be attracting attention too. And, in practical terms, it's one with particular relevance to your own daily challenges and wins at work. It's the story of innovation. Related: Olympians Are Calling the Food in Paris a 'Disaster' \u2014 and One Team Is Flying in Its Own Chef Olympians, innovation and you\u2026really? Absolutely. Without innovation, Biles would not be executing maneuvers that no other competitor, male or female, can even contemplate. Phelps would not have left Rio with his career-topping 23rd gold medal, and Ledecky wouldn't stand to break yet another record in the sport. Even if your personal athletic career involves nothing more strenuous than watching from your living room couch as the best of the best compete live in Paris this summer, you should consider how their successes can translate to creative breakthroughs in your own performance. By following a few Olympic-level innovation principles, you too can \"medal\" in today's grueling workplace competitions. \"At this point in time, nobody can beat Simone Biles,\" Nastia Liukin, a 2008 Gold Medalist, told The New York Times in 2016. Coach Aimee Boorman notes that Biles' routines require less running and allow her to do more tumbling than other gymnasts' routines do. It is this innovative combination of roundoff, back handspring, double layout, half-turn and landing that makes Biles the world's best. Where most competitors win by fractions of a point, Biles wins by one or two points. Still, the Olympian acknowledges the value in competing as a team. After Biles stepped aside at the Tokyo Games, she told her teammates that they were well-trained and ready to compete without her, People reported. The team didn't win gold, but Biles was \"very proud\" of the silver medal nevertheless, saying, \"I owe this to the girls, it has nothing to do with me.\" Related: Follow These 9 Olympic Athletes on Instagram for Some Epic Inspiration Phelps embodies a unique blend of physical endowments, exquisite technique and determination. Less obvious are the decades of innovation that prepared the way for his dominance. Take his mastery of the underwater dolphin kick that has so often propelled him to the medalists' podium. Phelps has benefited from innovations that go back at least to David Armbruster, who coached the University of Iowa swim team from 1917 to 1958. According to the International Swimming Hall of Fame, Armbruster first saw a demonstration of the dolphin kick technique in 1911 and then in the 1930s started encouraging his swimmers to use it instead of the traditional frog kick. Others also played a role in the development of the kick, including the physicist Volney Wilson, who was a swimming enthusiast as well as a contributor to the World War II project that produced the first atomic bomb. What's more, in 2012, Johns Hopkins professor of mechanical engineering Rajat Mittal took an interest in analyzing the stroke and lent his technical support to the U.S. swim team. TV viewers only see the athletes striving for greatness for two intense weeks, but all of this history and behind-the-scenes activity is actually a bigger part of the story.

Unsurprisingly, years of all-consuming toil separated that inspiring reverie on the banks of Lake Washington and the historic moment that the Americans became world champions under Adolf Hitler's baleful gaze. But the excitement of victory often eclipses all of the effort that led to it. You should never forget that it's effort that turns dreams into reality. While many breakthroughs begin with an idea, the ones that make a difference are realized through disciplined practice. Go ahead and dream, but then get down to work.

Ross's pioneering vision for Daring led to him raising $125 million from leading investors and celebrities such as D1 Capital, Peter Thiel, and Drake, and with Cadence, he aims to unite his personal passion for fitness with a drink scientifically designed to help athletes and business leaders to thrive. Over the course of this insightful 30-minute session, he addressed some key questions that many startup founders share, including: Watch the video above to hear Ross's advice, and check out some of the main takeaways below, which have been edited for length and clarity. \"I'm originally from Scotland in the UK, now living in LA. My original business, Daring, started in 2018 where I was back home working on our plant-based chicken for a couple of years. We were fortunate enough to come over to the U S in the back half of 2019 when I was able to take my first meeting with an investor. He believed in the business and the brand and over the last four years, we've scaled and found distribution across the country thanks to relationships with Starbucks, Walmart, Whole Foods \u2014 you name it, we're there and doing really well. Over the last three months or so, I have transitioned out of being the CEO day-to-day of that company. I'm now the chairman of Daring and I've recently launched my new performance hydration company Cadence with my co-founder George Heaton.\" Related: After a Cancer Scare, She Bootstrapped a Business From Her Kitchen to 3,500 Walmarts. Here's Her Secret Ingredient for Health \u2014 and Success. \"Should you go e-comm or be in physical stores? It's a great question. For me, when it was about my plant-based chicken product, I always comped against the chicken market. That was my biggest competitor. And if you look at chicken consumption, it's rarely bought DTC. I don't know about you, but I don't buy a lot of my protein or even food directly from a website. I buy it through grocery stores: Walmart, Target, even Instacart, which is coming from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer. So I think the question at the beginning is: Where are your customers buying today? And understanding that if they're traditionally buying online, then maybe a DTC strategy makes more sense. But if it's something like milk or almond milk or food products or beverage products, retail channels might be the decision to make.\" \"Success in retail is not measured by the number of stores. It's not measured by total distribution points. It's measured by units per store per week. And you're going to get the buyer comparing your product to the other products in that category. So what's important to understand is how it sells versus its nearest competitors. If it sells a wee bit more, you're going to be in the top percentile. If it sells less, you're going to be in the bottom percentile. And retailers will evaluate once or twice a year and ask, 'Do we want to keep this product or do we want to replace it with something else that is potentially a higher velocity item?' It's better to sell five units a week in 500 stores than to sell one unit a week in 2,500 stores.\" Related: His Side Hustle Made $20,000 in 2 Weeks After Catching Beyonc\u00e9's Attention \u2014 Now This 26-Year-Old Is Aiming for $1 Million Revenue \"I used LinkedIn to connect with Jack Sinclair from Sprouts. I messaged him and just said, 'Hey, I'm a fellow Scot, there's only a couple million of us! I've got a product that's going to change your retailer.' And he said that sounds good, we met and the rest is history. Jack gave me my first opportunity to land in America and was my first retailer, so I'll always be grateful. I think LinkedIn is a great platform. You'd be surprised how many people will get back to you if you have a good message and you're trying to offer them a great opportunity. Their job is to find the best products in the world, so you're not doing something they don't want to see. Put yourself out there.\" \"Having a strong brand identity and a strong value proposition are really important. You need to understand the white space that you fill within a category because that's the number one question I get from buyers: 'We already have this product and this product, what makes you different?' Is it pricing? Is it your branding? Are you partnered with a celebrity? Are you using an ingredient that's really unique and is trending in the market? You need to understand your brand's unique value proposition and its positioning in the market, and then ensure that your brand messaging is really clear, consistent and resonates with that store's audience.\" \"You need to optimize your packaging for retail. A lot of brands will be really successful selling online with minimal packaging. But that does not always translate in retail. Shoppers are met with this shelf of 50, 100 \u2014 sometimes 200 brands. You only have three to five seconds to get that consumer to pick your product up. So you need packaging that stands out on shelves. Communicate your brand story and benefits clearly.\" \"Being an entrepreneur is a stressful experience. You're always on. It's years and years where you just feel like you're just burning that candle. One of the reasons I launched Cadence was personal health. I spend a lot of time taking care of my physical and mental state. Starting and running a business is a marathon without sounding cliche. It's not a sprint. You've got to make sure that you can do this for the long term versus just a couple of years. Entrepreneurship is amazing, but there's a lot of uncertainty. There is risk and then there's also that concept of work-life balance that I'm still trying to figure out now in my second company. The isolation and time commitment is like nothing else. So I applaud anyone who's on their journey.\" Related: The Restaurateur Who Created a Safe Space for Celebrities to Eat in Peace in NYC \"At Daring, we were fortunate enough to get some interest from quote-unquote celebrities. We raised some capital from the likes of Drake, Cam Newton, and Naomi Osaka, as well as a lot of musicians, actors, sports and personalities. We also did some campaigns with the likes of the Kardashians and so on. But I think very rarely is it needle-moving for a retail brand. One thing I'll say always is that no one is going to change your business for you. No one is going to spend 12 hours a day on your company, 80 hours a week doing the hard work. No one but you is thinking about your business every single second of the day, so don't rely on a partnership to change your company. It comes from you.\""

In my experience, however, placing too much emphasis on these (to be sure, often admirable) qualities is in error. I've found that empathy, compassion and care make a much more significant impact on a company's success \u2014 that practicing such \"soft skills\" when running my own businesses has allowed me to reach the level of success I occupy today. Such skills are broadly defined as ways of relating and collaborating with others, and effective communication and complex task completion relies on their deft application, so practicing them routinely in the workplace is invaluable. According to a study by LinkedIn, \"92% of talent professionals say they matter as much or more than hard skills when they hire, and 80% say they're increasingly important to company success.\" I couldn't agree more. Not everyone is cut out to be a leader, but an acute understanding of communication, problem-solving and open-mindedness increases any professional's value. And these capabilities go beyond the workplace, affecting every aspect of life. Related: The No. 1 Skill Employers Want Job Applicants to Have Might Be the Hardest to Find, New Research Reveals This term is defined as the ability to practice awareness of other people's emotions and attempt to understand their experiences and perspectives. It requires a certain level of maturity but makes a profound difference in a staff's willingness to engage \u2014 fosters a sense of purpose and trust. Over the course of my travels around the world, I have both seen and experienced suffering and choosing not to overlook circumstances different from my own \u2014attempting to put myself in someone else's shoes \u2014 has taught me a deep sense of humility. It has also inspired me to start many of the businesses I own today, which would not exist without the ability to see beyond my own limits. To embrace empathy, listening is vital, as is not prioritizing your own tasks more than employees' work. So, commit to making those around you feel heard. (Therapy and business coaching can be great assists in that effort.) Empathy is a skill that must be practiced! Related: How To Be An Empathetic Leader (Without Getting Walked All Over) The desire to take action to help others, compassion differs from empathy in that it's not just an awareness of others' perspectives, but an inclination to be of service to them. It is the application of empathy. One way I practice it is by allowing employees to bring pets and kids into the workplace \u2014 to empathize with situations out of their control (like a babysitter canceling at the last minute). By opening up the workspace to what some might consider the \"untraditional,\" the goal is to assist to the best of my ability. Practicing compassion builds a more inclusive company culture, one that promotes a stronger work ethic by celebrating diversity, and reflecting on your own experiences of hardship and adversity is key. Take the time to evaluate how other people's compassion towards you made a positive impact, and assess how you can do the same for staff members. Related: How to Advocate for -- and Implement -- a 'Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day' Put simply, this is the ability to approach change with openness and understanding. When I consider the word, it's often in the context of developing new health and wellness products, and I assume things won't always go according to plan. I have to try many different takes/recipes to get the right balance, which is also true in many other facets of business, such as hiring and workflow. By entering a venture with a deliberate focus on sensitivity to change and willingness to pivot, achievement becomes markedly more likely. Effective adaptation requires patience and calmness, and I've found that meditation is profoundly helpful in fostering a positive mindset, but just as important is your perspective on work. Remember that no matter what, you have it good \u2014 you are fortunate and have skills to apply. If you truly believe and hold on to that notion, there's no challenge that can't be overcome. This is one of the most critical soft skills to practice when running a business. It's an untampered dedication to acting on morals and values and requires honesty, fairness and a great deal of introspection. As CEO, you might be placed on a pedestal, so the importance of uncompromised integrity is huge: you must accept your mistakes and look failure in the eye without cheating your values. It's been my experience that knowledge gained from failure far outweighs easy success at the expense of morals. That said, I know the temptation involved when a person is cornered in a position that seems unforgiving, with a staff relying on the company's success to make a living. That can be daunting. But there is always a choice\u2014a chance to not compromise for monetary gain. At the end of the day, you can forgive yourself for a failure but never for intentional wrongdoing. You'll need a strong sense of purpose because your ethics will be frequently tested. Related: Leading By Example: Why You Must Chart Your Own Course As An Entrepreneur Don't assume soft skills will come easily; they get cultivated over time.

        "body": "Professional services firms make up a majority of the small business universe in the U.S. Most never cross the seven-figure revenue mark or even see it on the radar. They tend to be dominated by a few loyal clients. Hard-driving founders work 24/7 to get projects done and, if a client asks, they will sell the few minutes they have free every week to breathe. They depend so heavily on the owner's time and talents and are notoriously hard to scale and monetize. My partner and I ultimately scaled our professional services firm to nearly eight figures when we finally figured out that larger opportunities tended to go to larger businesses. We were good at selling and delivering for our clients. But with just the two of us playing all roles in our business, we were overburdened \u2014 and clients knew it. They saw us juggling multiple tasks and companies and got used to receiving emails at all hours of the night when we finally had free time to answer their questions. They often gave additional consulting engagements to other firms because of our limited bandwidth. We lost millions of dollars in opportunities when we thought small. We broke through the million-dollar mark and kept right on going when we started thinking like a larger firm. We talked a bigger game at the beginning and took on debt to hire consultants and salespeople to get there. It was nerve-wracking, and there were some sleepless nights. But pretty quickly we started to see more opportunities in the pipeline, current clients expanding their scope of services with us and competitive opportunities we had never been included in before. Here are three ironclad rules that drove our success: Related: 4 Tips for Building a Million-Dollar Business Unless you can charge tens of thousands an hour or clone yourself a few times over, you will never consistently make that much money selling your personal skills. You need people \u2014 or at least the illusion of more people (until you get bodies in place) to get real revenues. Our approach? We figured out what clients liked about us most and we rewrote our sales materials to include words like \"our team\" and \"our approach.\" Behind the scenes, we created a training guide and videos for new employees to learn our hows (and our whys) and then be able to sell them. Our success ultimately was tied to our willingness to hire well ahead of the curve and put the expert team in place that our new sales materials promised. A big rookie mistake we didn't make was to hire part-time or less experienced people than the business needed. Instead, we hired experienced heavy hitters who were bored in corporate America and looking for a new challenge. We couldn't quite meet their sky-high salaries, but we made up for it with flexibility and independence. In a few cases, we granted equity in exchange for work quality, tenure and sales. But we took most of the hit personally by staying at far reduced salaries for almost two years. It was a slog, but it allowed us to make a few key hires who were critical to driving the business and helping us hire more superstars. Related: How I Built A Million-Dollar Business In 12 Months We fancied ourselves our firm's best salespeople. Unfortunately, we also were the chief recruiter, head editor, lead administrative assistant and accountant. We just didn't have enough time in the day to sell. But if you aren't selling at a services firm, you're dead in the water. Our only other option was to invest (heavily) in the sales function. We hired someone to uncover and tee up opportunities, giving us more time to focus on closing bigger deals. Keep salespeople's compensation risk-based. We used a highly motivating tiered compensation plan and built in hefty bonuses for achieving sky-high numbers. Our first salesperson doubled earnings year over year when he finally crossed the $2 million threshold. We made money, he was a happy employee, and my partner and I forgot (almost) about giving up several months' salary to bring him in. These days, it might make more sense to invest in a marketing platform like Hubspot, Salesforce or a myriad of other new competitors to do the heavy lifting. By the time we sold our firm, nearly 50% of new opportunities for our $100,000-plus consulting agreements came through these tools. Be sure to save some money in the budgets for marketing platform consultants. It took us a while to tweak our system and stop nearly two-thirds of our emails from getting snagged by spam filters.

This transformation is a testament to the vision and resilience of its co-owners, Vincent Beretta and Kevin Moulder. Related: How Tres Lecheria started their business from the ground up Initially, Vincent's career was in cloud SaaS sales, but when his path crossed with Kevin, a seasoned cake decorator, they used their individual skills to embark on their first business venture. They started by opening Cube's Baking Company, which focused on cube-shaped pastries like \"cupcubes\" (cube-shaped cupcakes), pretzel cubes, and muffins. However, it was their tres leches cakes that saw explosive popularity, and that was the turning point. Vincent and Kevin pivoted their focus entirely to this product, rebranding as Tres Lecheria. Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Vincent. Their decision to lean into the tres leches cakes paid off. They secured a deal with New Seasons Market, expanding from one store to all 18 of the chain's locations. This success was a springboard for further growth, with Tres Lecheria now in 80 stores and eyeing expansion into 80 more. Related: How an Annoying Backbreaking Chore Sparked the Idea for This Entrepreneur's Thriving Business Transitioning from a local bakery to a wholesale supplier wasn't without its hurdles. Vincent emphasized the importance of maintaining product quality, even when considering co-packers (companies contracted to package products for their clients) to meet growing demand. \"No one is going to treat your product as well as you treat it yourself,\" he said, highlighting the need for stringent quality control. Vincent knows Tres Lecheria's customers have high standards and aren't afraid to contact him about their concerns. He shared how customers act as \"cheerleaders\" and even \"tattletales,\" providing valuable insights into product performance and store displays. \"We hear from everybody now,\" he said. \"Customers let us know if a store isn't carrying a flavor they love or if there's an issue with the product display. Their feedback is invaluable.\" Financial acumen has also been instrumental in guiding Tres Lecheria's growth. Vincent stressed the importance of making data-driven decisions as they expand. \"You have to track your expenses and know your numbers,\" he emphasized. \"It's the only way to confidently say which products to invest in.\" Once your business is ready to expand to new counties, or even states, Vincent cautions other entrepreneurs to be mindful about how they'll strategize growth geographically. Testing the waters with a temporary location or other promotions can help businesses determine the demographics of each area and whether they align with their target market. \"Can you run ads that'll bring this neighborhood [to a different location]? Can you do a pop up once in a while, like a farmer's market in a place you want to try out? We got in a little bit of trouble with that when we were trying to expand into California. You can't always recreate the exact same thing that made you successful in the first place. Every situation is going to be different. There's going to be different luck or bad luck involved.\" Tres Lecheria's journey is a testament to the power of adaptability and customer engagement.

        "body": "Expanding a startup team has always been hard. Startup founders have to take into account many factors before letting new people into their team at early stages. This is only made worse by pressure from investors expecting fast results. The current situation only makes hiring even more challenging. The pandemic and the shortage of immigrant workers in many sectors, including IT, broke established market rules. Now, on top of the usual startup-related difficulties, founders have to transform their business and switch to the virtual realm \u2014 specifically, by hiring remotely. Here's how the classic hiring methods have changed and what the new options are. Recently, the recruiters in my community have been saying that their market is literally boiling over \u2014 too many new offers and not enough professionals to respond to them. Whilst on my platform, I receive hundreds of new applications from developers weekly. What I see is a skills shortage. Maybe the lockdowns kept people from going to courses, getting some practice or they just got used to the perpetual vacation. Everyone expects to get a salary over $200k, but rarely do their experience and skills match their expectations. I suggest non-technical founders get an advisor who is a senior developer who can interview the candidates. They will give the right tasks, check the performance and figure out the candidates' real knowledge of infrastructure and coding languages. This is necessary for two reasons: Founders will prepare the right offer and will have appropriate expectations regarding the coders' work. Related: The First Virtual Job Fair for Programmers Arrives in Mexico If you don't want to get lost in this hiring melting pot, make sure your job description really describes what you're looking for. It should not be too general, nor combine 2-3 positions in one unless specified as a temporarily 2-in-1 role. If you need a visionary leader, as opposed to a worker that will only follow set tasks, distinguish the two roles. Hire a professional recruiter to consult you on writing a comprehensive job description. Otherwise, delegate it to outstaffing agencies that will do end-to-end hiring for you. Now that you know what you can offer and what you should expect from the candidate, place the job description on various platforms. Divide them into two segments \u2014 first the junior developers' profiles, then the more experienced software engineers. Junior programmers are good for startups led by full-stack developers, where the CTO can teach, correct and navigate fresh hires until they become mature coders. Although, experience shows that juniors often learn everything they need and move to another company within 8-9 months. Middle to senior developers are harder to find. Retaining them is an even harsher game. They will bring extensive experience and can be good advisers for your product development, but at the same time, they will bring biases and culture from previous jobs. You could ask for advice from recruiting agencies or serial entrepreneurs about how to set up the company culture, especially for remote or hybrid teams with a dozen of newly hired employees.

If you don't set up the optimal process for hiring at the beginning, it will become very time-consuming. Along with that, make one wrong step and your employer brand reputation will suffer, scaring all cool programmers away from your startup. You probably know the traditional job posting platforms by now. So here are a couple of new platforms I'd like to highlight: Look for specialists that are already used to the remote lifestyle. Digital nomads and engineers who have worked in autonomous environments are your primary target. Think about what they need or wish to have, things like: Forget about team building and group retreats. Listen to the real needs of your employees, give them choices and flexibility. Sharing a mission, the same culture and work attitudes should be key to finding your developers. Employee perks, flexible schedules and engaging tasks will make them happy. If you see that you cannot cover all these aspects at your current stage, don't hesitate to delegate it to HR and outstaffing companies, or hire professional recruiters.

        "body": "These days, every business seems to be \"going green.\" Even Burger King followed the trend back in 2020 but took the ad campaign concept to another level. Remember the fast-food giant's video featuring time-lapse footage of a Whopper growing vast quantities of mold over a month? While the point was to differentiate Burger King's \"preservative-free\" products from those of McDonald's \u2014 the company with fries that seemingly (and shockingly) never go bad \u2014 the video didn't exactly strike gold. Did the video create buzz? Yes, but it reportedly \u2014 and perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 performed 36% worse next to restaurant-industry benchmarks. So while the global campaign caused a stir, it didn't exactly whet appetites or inspire the intended results. The moldy burger montage is a great example of what can happen when a video marketing campaign isn't well-connected to a business's practical goals. It seems highly unlikely that Burger King's creative team wanted to turn viewers off. However, their avant-garde attempt to make a statement would probably have been left in the brainstorming room had they spent more time fleshing out their campaign and aligning their efforts with their overall business goals. Related: Align your Business Strategies and Become a Goal Accomplisher Burger King can afford a few fails and live another day, but your startup may not have the same capacity to absorb a marketing video mishap. That's why you must prioritize connecting all your marketing efforts, video marketing included, to your explicit goals. For example, you may want to attract new clientele or create recruitment opportunities. Video can aid with all of the above, but it must be thoughtfully crafted. So why don't more startups get positive mileage from their video concepts? Often, leaders and founders buy into the common misconception that the work stops once the video is released. The only way for a video to become rocket fuel for a business's growth is if it's nurtured from start to finish. From the outset, the video must be written to mesh with your brand's identity. If it doesn't, it needs to be scrapped in favor of a better-aligned concept. At the backend, after production, you must deploy it on the right channels and monitor its effectiveness. That way, you can pivot if needed. Trying to cut this process short only leaves you with a video that's in danger of being misaligned with your company's overall mission, purpose, and objectives. Related: 4 Keys to Creating the Video Ad Your Business Needs Taking care of all the moving parts when it comes to making a video for your startup doesn't have to be arduous or complicated. Follow the following actionable best practices to link your video marketing concepts with well-defined goals. 1. Begin with questions in mind Before you ever put a stylus to a screen or sketch a storyboard, think about what you want your video to do and how you want to do it. Ask yourself some essential questions: Who is my audience? Where in the marketing funnel does the video belong? What is the main message we're trying to get across? Once you're crystal clear on the \"whys\" of your video, you can move forward. Don't be surprised if your questions elicit answers you didn't expect. You may find that some of your team members disagree on how best to position your video. It's wise to get those conversations out of the way, so everyone aligns to the same purpose. The last thing you want is for some members of your video creation team to be out of sync. 2. Set up those SMART goals Now that you know a little more about your video, you can set SMART goals. As a refresher, SMART is an acronym for \"specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\" For example, a great SMART goal for a startup would be to increase monthly traffic to your product page by 35% by this time next year. It's OK to have just one goal for your video rather than a dozen. In fact, the narrower your goal, the easier it will be to focus on the messaging and delivery. Related: What Are SMART Goals and How Can You Set and Achieve Them? Let's say you come up with a SMART goal for your video. You then need to ensure the goal feeds into your startup's overall goals. You can't afford to waste time or money making a video with a goal that isn't aligned with your business's needs. Make sure you're sharing your content to achieve a purpose, not \"just because.\" A \"just because\" video might be fun to film, but it won't move the needle on your startup goals. 3. Write and produce your video Whether you work with a studio and agency or film your video in-house, expect the experience to require a little time. Shooting even a 30-second commercial can take longer than you might expect. Seven years ago, one CBS reporter went on the hunt to discover just how long a typical TV spot took to get from idea to publication. The answer could only be measured in months, the reporter concluded. Remember: Bringing a video to life requires multiple stages. From scriptwriting to editing and casting to post-production, you'll need to set aside enough time to get everything done. The process shouldn't and can't be a slapdash endeavor. Related: The 8 Most Popular and Effective Uses of Video Marketing 4. Track your video's performance like a hawk Don't just send your video into the world with well wishes and a big kiss \u2014 check its performance regularly and monitor how it's doing. Pinpoint a few KPIs to record and analyze to help measure your SMART goals. One KPI that HubSpot suggests tracking is video watch time, given that 45% of people who hang out for the first three seconds will stick it out to the end. Other KPIs include click-through rates, subscriber rates, social shares, and bounces. If this is your first video, you won't have much of a baseline to work from in terms of knowing whether a KPI is good or bad. However, as you push more videos into the market, you'll start to see which ones do best. One may go viral while another may have less of an impact. Learn from these results and leverage them for future video content. While it might seem obvious that Burger King's unappetizing commercial wouldn't produce terrific success, the video fail is a good reminder that any company can make mistakes. The trick is to plan well so your startup's videos \u2014 unlike that uneaten Whopper \u2014 end up being snackable."

        "body": "Many people dream of starting their own business. Running an enterprise in your home, garage or on the go means you can take more control over your professional goals, set more ambitious financial targets and achieve a more desirable work-life balance. But what if you're ready to start a business but don't know what type of services to provide? You've come to the right place if you need profitable business ideas. Below, find a detailed breakdown of 63 small business ideas \u2014 from financial services to physical labor and creative contracting \u2014 to help you chart a path forward. Related: Want to Start a Simple Business That Helps the Planet? After 'One Night's Worth of Research,' He Started an Eco-Friendly Gig And Now Makes $200K a Year Some of these opportunities require more experience or credentials than others. Some can be started from home for cheap, while others require dedicated office space and capital investment. To ensure you choose the right business venture for yourself, it's crucial to consider a few factors before you pursue a sole proprietorship. For instance, if you already have a CPA license, venturing out as a freelance accountant (as detailed below) would be a natural avenue to explore. If you have experience as a writer, you might consider editorial services, or if you've spent years working in the food and beverage industry, you could explore catering or becoming a personal chef. As you explore your options, consider if you'll need to secure special licenses (for example, hairstylists and electricians) or if the work requires additional education and credentialing. For some people, starting a small business means leaving their full-time gig and committing to the new endeavor. For others, a part-time business provides meaningful supplemental income and can be managed in addition to other work. Consider how much money you're hoping to earn from the business, how many clients or customers you'll need to be profitable and how many hours you'll need to work each week to make it feasible. Think about capital costs, as well as growth: Will launching the business require the purchase of equipment or other serious financial investment? Do you plan to hire employees? Will you expand to multiple locations? At the outset, it's a good idea to create a formal business plan. Finding customers and clients is essential to any small business, so conduct a market analysis before you open shop. For instance, your boat cleaning business will be significantly more successful if you live near a coast, and your side hustle as an interpreter will likely be more profitable if you live in a diverse community. You should also research what businesses already exist. Is there a dearth of dependable landscapers in your market? Is there a glut of professional photographers in your town? Answering these questions will help you determine the viability of your idea. The digital age has created many opportunities for entrepreneurs to run a business from behind a laptop, meaning their enterprise can go wherever they choose. That's not for everyone, though. If you want to run a brick-and-mortar shop at the heart of your community or are more comfortable interacting with customers and clients in person, launch a business that will allow you to achieve those goals.

If you do, you should consider getting specialized training in handling and properly cleaning these carpets. Learn how to get tough stains and odors out of carpets \u2014 such as dog and cat odors \u2014 and customers will seek your services out. You'll need a dedicated space for people to drop off their rugs, so plan for that as you set up your business. Experience, training or licensing may be needed There are many different ways of getting into the jewelry business and different types of materials you can work with. Manipulating metal will require specific tools since you need to heat the metal and use tools to cut and engrave, but you'll likely also work with glass, gemstones, and maybe even wood. The wider the variety of materials you can work with, , the broader the range of repair services you can provide to your customers, including stone polishing and setting.

Sandlin | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble Experience, training or licensing may be needed Every community needs trusted real estate agents. Whether your clients are buying or selling property \u2014 or just seeking real estate advice \u2014 there are many opportunities to launch your own business. But, first, you'll need to become a licensed agent, and the requirements vary by state. Typically, you'll have to complete coursework and pass an exam. Once you've done that, you can start offering services and building your business from scratch. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Many people manage properties as a side hustle. Maybe you have a vacation home that you use for short-term rentals or perhaps you have an additional property with a long-term lease. If you want to dive in full-time, you can acquire multiple properties and be a full-time landlord. In the case of rental units, your job will be to make sure the property is running smoothly, ensure tenants are paying rent and honoring their lease terms, and be available in case of any issues. You can also contract with individual property owners to serve as their property manager, lightening their load by taking care of the landlord duties for them. No experience needed There are many directions you can take this small business idea. If you want to work during hours when no one else does, you can focus your cleaning business on office clients. You can provide cleaning services to retail businesses and keep your customers within one or two blocks. Restaurants need daily thorough cleaning and can also be a great source of steady clients. But, if you're more interested in house cleaning, you can start with a small number of clients, and new customers will likely emerge via word of mouth. Read This: Start Your Own Cleaning Service by Entrepreneur Press and Jacquelyn Lynn |Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble Has expansion possibilities Spatial planning is not everyone's strength. If it's yours, you can make good money as a professional organizer for individuals and businesses. For individuals, you can choose either to do the organizing work \u2014 maybe a kids' playroom or a cluttered garage \u2014 or consult with the homeowner to help them better organize themselves. Businesses, too, don't always know how to organize their office and maximize the efficiency of their spaces. You can consult on ways to better arrange furniture, desks, conference areas, stockrooms and more. Experience, training or licensing may be needed To be a successful inspector, first establish contacts with real estate agents who can recommend your services to customers. Home inspection can be an incredibly competitive market so you will need to constantly update your education and knowledge. For instance, Builders are constantly introducing new materials. If you only know about wood decks, you will not know how to inspect and assess the new materials on the market, such as composites that look like real wood. Also, stay apprised of all safety updates regarding materials and problems with things like off-gassing, carbon monoxide production and other chemical hazards. Read This: Start Your Own Home Inspection Service by Entrepreneur Press | Amazon |eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble Experience, training or licensing may be needed Homeowners are always looking for ways to save on their utility bills. With some specialized training, you can help by conducting an audit of their homes and calculating how much they might save on heating, cooling and electrical use by implementing new technology or upgraded appliances. To grow your business, you can work directly with vendors to refer upgrades or gain a certification and learn how to do electrical work like installing solar panels and heat pumps yourself. Read This: Toward a Zero Energy Home: A Complete Guide to Energy Self-Sufficiency at Home by David Johnston and Scott Gibson | Amazon | Barnes & Noble Experience, training or licensing may be needed If you have an eye for design, market your interior decorating talents to building contractors. People purchasing new homes can often be overwhelmed with choices and possibilities. Create questionnaires for each major element and room in the house: Depending on how involved your client wants to be, you can also help them purchase furniture, art, plants and more. You can also work with businesses, such as hotels and restaurants, to design their spaces. Has expansion possibilities There are a variety of ways to launch an event-planning business, particularly if you have a professional background in planning large gatherings. First, you'll want to hone in on your niche, some of which include: If you work with businesses, you must visit every potential event location you plan to work with. Tour each site and learn what's available, including capacity, AV equipment, chairs and tables and more. If you can nail a big party as an event planner, new clients will seek you out. Read This: Start Your Own Event Planning Business by The Staff at Entrepreneur Media and Cheryl Kimball | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble Experience, training or licensing may be needed You will need to be up-to-date on wedding trends, dress styles, popular colors \u2014 and almost every other facet of the wedding industry. Offer your customers an \u00e0 la carte menu of services, from helping them choose flowers, a wedding gown and bridesmaid dresses to picking the venue and hiring the caterer. Before you open your business, visit area wedding shops and see what kinds of services they provide. Wedding planners need to know every business detail to assure couples that they are in the right hands. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Some people take great joy in planning their vacations. However, if you're an experienced traveler and know how to save people money, you can still be very much in demand as a vacation planner for individuals or large groups. You can coordinate hotel and flight bookings, arrange transportation, provide daily itineraries and help your clients re-book in case of unforeseen travel crises. There's typically no required certification for this work, but there are courses you can take that will put you and your clients at ease. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Active children and adults alike often seek athletic instruction beyond what they've learned in group formats. If you're highly skilled in an athletic discipline, you can help take athletes to the next level. Common business options include: In terms of qualifications, you should already have some coaching experience and be able to offer high-level instruction. Depending on the community where you're coaching, you may need to have a license to run your business or a certification to use public amenities, like tennis courts, for profit. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Many people are looking to improve their overall fitness, and working with a personal trainer is one way to achieve their goals. To get started, you'll need to obtain a certification \u2014 especially if you're working with a gym \u2014 which will help your clients trust that you know what you're doing and can help them avoid injury. You can advertise your business at gyms and other public places, and having a strong social media and web presence is always helpful. Experience, training or licensing may be needed With so many different dieting trends and supplements in the world, a nutritionist can help people better understand the landscape of healthy eating and living. Although nutritionists don't offer medical nutritional counseling or treat illnesses (as a dietitian does), there is still a wide market for the work. First, determine what kind of nutrition service you want to provide \u2014 pediatric, sports, holistic or something else \u2014 and then work toward credentialing. At a minimum, you'll need to research the laws for becoming certified in your state and begin taking prerequisite courses to help you become licensed. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Life coaching has exploded in popularity over the past decade, as many people are looking to recreate or realign their personal goals. Life coaches do not provide clinical mental healthcare (a therapist does), but they help people create and use tools to move closer to their ultimate goals. To become a life coach, you'll first want to determine what kind of client you're looking for: You don't technically need certification, though many practitioners take courses and have credentials. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Career coaches help people navigate professional transitions, establish business goals and make the most of their skills. As a career coach, you might help people write cover letters and resumes, find new opportunities, establish business plans and success strategies or hone their niche in a crowded market. Your background and specialty will determine what clientele you should work with: Although there is no standard license or certification, many career coaches have earned credentials or successful careers of their own. Experience, training or licensing may be needed If you have a background in education, you can make significant supplemental income \u2014 or launch a full-fledged business \u2014 by offering tutoring services. Start by choosing the subject area that best fits your strengths. For instance, if you're a professional writer or English teacher, you could offer essay writing help. If you're skilled in math and sciences, you could help high schoolers with algebra or precalculus. You don't have to be a licensed teacher to offer tutoring services, but being a subject matter expert will make it easier to sell your services to potential customers. Experience, training or licensing may be needed If you have experience working in restaurants or other areas of the food and beverage industry, you could tap into the growing private chef market. Whether potential customers are looking to accommodate specific dietary needs or an intimate event with friends, a positive experience should lead to client testimonials and referrals to help you grow your business. You'll want to make sure you have proper training \u2014 either via work experience or formal courses \u2014 because your reputation is on the line with every dish you create. No experience needed Do you have a room that has its own bathroom and is private from the rest of the living space? Or do you own a property that could function as a small lodging establishment near a tourist area, sports stadium or large venue? Maybe you own a charming home in the country. If so, turn your property into a bed and breakfast or Airbnb rental and welcome guests into a home away from home. Read This: Start Your Own Bed and Breakfast by Entrepreneur Press and Cheryl Kimball | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble Experience, training or licensing may be needed Are you experienced with managing large-scale food operations? Consider branching out into catering to serve large events like weddings and corporate banquets. You'll need to make sure you have strong project- and personnel-management skills, because catering requires you to lead a team and deliver exceptional service for clients. You'll also need to obtain the proper licensing from the state in which you operate, similar to the requirements for opening a restaurant. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Do you want to deliver a specific type of cuisine to the masses without running an entire restaurant? Build (or purchase) a food truck and take your product on the go. You'll have to obtain appropriate operating licenses, but once you've checked those boxes, you can start working at festivals, breweries and other community events. As your reputation grows, you'll likely book business by word-of-mouth. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Have you always wanted to run your own brewery? Maybe you've already been experimenting with brewing at home.? If so, opening a brewery could be an option. But first, you'll want to pursue training in brewing sciences and work as an apprentice to someone who knows the craft well. From there, you'll need to conduct a competitive market analysis to make sure there's room for another brewery in your area. Has expansion possibilities If you have a flexible schedule and can make multiple house calls, you can generate significant revenue as a dog walker. Dog walkers take pooches out for their daily constitutional one or more times a day, individually or in small groups. In some cities, like New York, dog walking alone can be a booming business. But, it's more common for dog walkers to offer additional services, including playing with and feeding pets, bringing in newspapers and mail and turning lights on and off. Read This: Start Your Own Pet Business and More by Entrepreneur Press and Eileen F. Sandlin | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble Experience, training or licensing may be needed Most people leave behind their pets when they travel. Although big daycare shelters exist, you can make decent money by offering a more personal pet-sitting service \u2014 either by staying at someone's house while they're out of town or by hosting their animal at your place. Starting a pet-sitting service requires almost nothing in startup costs. Your list of credentials should probably include personal pet ownership \u2014 if not currently, at least in the past \u2014 and other pet-related experience, including referrals from pet owners whose pets you have taken care of before. Read This: Start Your Own Pet Sitting Business and More by Entrepreneur Press and Cheryl Kimball | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble Experience, training or licensing may be needed Most animals need a bath or fresh cut from time to time. Most pet owners aren't equipped to do a full grooming themselves. This means there's a target market for professional groomers who do house calls or have a space where people can drop their pets for a few hours. There are no required certifications, but most groomers begin by taking courses, which are widely available in most states. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Childcare needs continue to soar in the United States, and many people prefer for their child to be cared for in a home environment as opposed to a more institutional setting. These factors make the market ripe for a home-based childcare business. The regulations for a home-based child care vary by state, so you'll need to pursue appropriate certifications and training depending on where you live. Read This: Start Your Own Child-Care Service by The Staff of Entrepreneur Media and Jacquelyn Lynn | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble Has expansion possibilities Finding a niche is the best way to start out in the gift basket business. Are you a dog-lover, horse enthusiast or exercise guru who could put together baskets that hold the things that people with this interest would like? Do you already create a product that a gift basket could be built around? You could create custom, place-based gift baskets that could be shipped across the country or sold in a local store, or you can collaborate with local makers to get your business idea off the ground. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Styling hair or working as a barber is a popular business idea that can be lucrative if you have the right skills and online presence. Typically, a home-based hairstylist business or barber shop would be started by someone with a cosmetology career who wants to go out on their own. If you don't have experience, you can take courses and sharpen your skills by working in someone else's shop. You'll need to obtain the appropriate licenses before you can launch your own business. Experience, training or licensing may be needed If you'd like to offer professional nail styling to clients, most states require that you complete cosmetology school \u2014 the number of hours varies depending on where you live. It can be smart to work with someone else before opening your own shop so you learn the skills and techniques you need to be successful. Once you've completed these steps, you can run your own small business from home or a dedicated storefront. Experience, training or licensing may be needed Massage therapy can be a successful business, but you must have the proper education and training to not cause injury to your clients. At a minimum, you will want to become certified, which will help you practice safely and ultimately market your qualifications. Certification courses cover not only human anatomy and physiology and the ways massage affects both, but also how to establish your own successful massage business. Has expansion possibilities People tend to acquire more things than they can reasonably store in their homes. If you have land, you could make meaningful income by storing large items like recreational vehicles, boats, trailers and campers. Or, if you want to dive deeper into the self-storage business, you could consider opening a storage facility, which would require an increase in overhead costs, appropriate licensing and market analysis. Driving experience needed If you drive for companies like Uber and Lyft, you lose a percentage of your wage to the company. However, there are still market demands for private drivers. If you have a reliable vehicle \u2014 or can afford to manage a fleet and other drivers \u2014 you can cater to high-end clients not interested in using ride-share apps for their transportation needs. Newer peer-to-peer car rental services like Turo (think Airbnb for cars) also allow potential business owners to rent out their vehicles to generate incremental income when not in use. No experience needed Do you have items lurking around your household that you could sell? Or are you scouring Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace and thrift stores for deals on items you could flip?Here's a relatively straightforward online business idea: Auction or sell the items you find on one of online marketplaces. Reselling products online can provide a major source of supplemental income, especially if you're willing to refurbish items and sell them at a higher rate. Anyone can get into this type of business as long as they're willing to hustle. Experience, training or licensing may be needed In communities with international populations, dependable interpreters and translators are extremely valuable. If you already speak multiple languages, you could earn extra income as an interpreter if you pursue a certification, which typically involves about 40 hours of training. From there, you can determine what type of translation service clients you're seeking: business professionals, government officials, folks who need documents translated and more. Addressing these foundational \"business checklist\" elements early on can set a strong course for growth and operational efficiency for your entrepreneurial endeavor. Create a detailed business plan outlining your business goals, strategies for achieving them, market analysis, operational structure and financial projections. This document is crucial for guiding your strategy and securing business loans. Choose the appropriate legal structure for your business (e.g., sole proprietorship, LLC, partnership, corporation), and register your business according to local laws. Your chosen business structure affects your taxes, liability and business operations, so consult an attorney and a certified accountant before finalizing your decision. Set up a robust system for managing your finances, including budgeting, bookkeeping and financial forecasting. Consider your startup costs, ongoing expenses and how you will fund your business idea. Keeping personal and business finances separate is also highly advisable. Outline your business' operational needs, including staffing, location, equipment, technology and software needs. Consider how you will efficiently manage the production of goods or delivery of services. If through social media platforms, affiliate marketing or search engine optimization, consider how you will establish a strong brand identity and develop a marketing plan to reach your target audience. This should include your branding elements (logo, color scheme) and your strategies for content creation, promotion and advertising. Ensure you know and comply with all relevant city and state laws, regulations and industry standards. This includes obtaining necessary licenses and permits, understanding labor laws if hiring employees and ensuring data protection and privacy. Support networks can provide invaluable advice, feedback and connections. Build a network of mentors, advisors and fellow entrepreneurs. This network might be close friends, former colleagues or paid mastermind groups."

Image Credit: Courtesy of Crispy Cones. Kaitlyn Carlson, left; Barbara Corcoran, center; Jeremy Carlson, right. A student at Brigham Young University at the time, Carlson attended classes during the day and attempted to recreate the dessert in his aunt's kitchen at night. It took Carlson about six months experimenting with recipes \"through the night all the way to 3 or 4 a.m.\" until he got it right and was ready to sell. At that point, in 2018, he opened up shop out of a canopy tent on the side of the road, selling grilled dough cones stuffed with spread and fresh fruits. Related: He Started an 'Accidental' Business at 25 With Just $2,000 \u2014 Then Gave His Product to the Pope: 'Anyone Can Be an Entrepreneur' As the business continued to grow, Carlson needed to expand his operation \u2014 so he designed a trailer and had it built in China. That was \"the turning point\" for Crispy Cones, Carlson says, as he began adding gourmet soft serve ice cream inside the dough cone. When Crispy Cones outgrew that trailer, Carlson and his wife, Kaitlyn, who serves as the company's chief marketing officer, went on to open two small storefronts, one in Logan, Utah and another in Carlson's hometown of Rexburg, Idaho, during their first year of marriage. It was a very stressful period, Carlson admits, as the couple bootstrapped the venture entirely \"on a college budget.\" \"We had other jobs, other businesses,\" Carlson says. \"We were filming weddings, taking wedding pictures for other couples. We were figuring out how to build this business without getting into lots of debt or having to raise money.\" Another significant chapter began for Crispy Cones one night when the Carlsons watched an episode of Shark Tank, looked at each other and wondered, Why can't that be us? \"We believe in manifesting our future,\" Carlson says. \"You say it, you believe [it], [and] you can do it.\" So the couple submitted their application, and three months later, they received a call from the casting crew with an offer to appear on the show. Then, after six months of preparation with producers, the Carlsons were ready to face the judges in September 2022; the episode aired on March 17, 2023.

By the end of the session, the \"only Shark that really believed\" in the business was Barbara Corcoran. She offered to invest $200,000 for 20% equity. Following a six-month period of due diligence, the deal closed in January 2023. Crispy Cones had raised money for the first time, but the business's scrappy history stuck with Carlson \u2014 and what had once been its greatest challenge became its greatest strength. \"That taught me to stretch the dollar and value the dollar as an entrepreneur,\" Carlson says. \"So when I see these other companies raising millions of dollars, I don't think the founders really appreciate or value the dollar.\" Related: Shark Tank's Most Successful Brand of All Time Wasn't Even Supposed to Be a Business at First. Here's How It Became One With $1 Billion in Lifetime Revenue. After the Shark Tank appearance, \"publicity was huge\" and \"the money was great,\" but Carlson says the partnership with Corcoran was the best part of the deal. \"Her expertise, mentorship [and] connections, just having her part of our team as an asset and as an owner, has changed the whole face of our company,\" Carlson says. Image Credit: Courtesy of Crispy Cones With Corcoran's help, Crispy Cones has continued to grow. The company opened four more stores alongside its original two in Provo, Utah; Chandler, Arizona; Tempe, Arizona; and Orlando, Florida, with additional locations coming soon. What's more, franchising is the company's next big frontier: It sold 54 new franchise locations nationwide this year and plans to open 100 locations in 2025. \"I've always thought that responsible franchising was genius for both parties involved,\" Carlson says. \"The concept should only be [franchised] if it's a simplified process where it's easily replicated within the brand. So, for example, big restaurants with like 30 different things on their menu \u2014 that would be very hard to franchise. For our concept, it's such a simple product, and we have dummied down the whole process [so much] that we have franchisees willing to do five to 10 units In the next three to four years.\" Additionally, Carlson says that one of the best parts of responsible franchising is giving other people the opportunity to become entrepreneurs and start their own businesses.

Carlson admits that loneliness often goes hand in hand with entrepreneurship. His advice is to keep pushing forward anyway \u2014 because you never know when that next big break might be around the corner. \"Being able to overcome hardships alone is one of the most valuable characteristics you can learn as an entrepreneur,\" Carlson says. \"Entrepreneurs are a totally separate breed than the average American who's going to a 9-5. There's no security. It's all risk, and you're risking your time, money and life. So understand that it's okay to be on a lonely path for a time, and it's normal to feel that way \u2014 but it's worth it every single time.\" This article is part of our ongoing Young Entrepreneur\u00ae series highlighting the stories, challenges and triumphs of being a young business owner."

        "body": "In the vibrant greenscapes of Maryland, Nature's Friends Landscaping stands as a pillar of craftsmanship and dedication in the landscaping industry. Here, Cliff Bressler nurtures every garden and tree and tree with the same passion and precision as those in his own backyard. In 1999, Bressler transitioned from the corporate world to follow his love for the outdoors. This shift marked the beginning of a new era for him with his profound knowledge of plant life and a commitment to sustainable beauty. Bressler and his team ensure that each project they take on enhances the lives of their clients, and Nature's Friends has, in turn, become synonymous with exceptional quality and unwavering reliability. \"My big goal for this business was to not have to travel far for work,\" Bressler says, highlighting his focus on cultivating local gardens and building strong community ties through personalized service. His business approach is built around a cornerstone of meticulous attention to detail and respect for the environment, and this philosophy extends beyond landscaping to fostering connections between his clients and their outdoor spaces. Listen to the episode below to hear directly from Bressler. Nature's Friends distinguishes itself by offering comprehensive solutions tailored to each client's unique needs. Bressler's commitment to excellence is evident in every project, driven by his belief in delivering value that justifies his pricing. \"I'm usually middle to high-end,\" he says. \"For the work I do, I will be on the upper end of cost, but I can guarantee clients [they're] going to get great quality service.\" Liz S., a loyal customer and Yelp Elite, echoed this sentiment. \"I can't say enough great things about Cliff and his crew,\" she says. \"If you're looking for someone who knows plants and trees, cares about his clients, is clear and communicative, as well as really nice to do business with, look no further.\" Further reinforcing the value he provides, Bressler takes the time to really get each client's vision just right, transforming their outdoor spaces in ways that go beyond just looking good\u2014they're about creating sustainable and beautiful environments everyone can enjoy. Liz regards Bressler's attentiveness and interactions with customers as what sets Nature's Friends Landscaping apart. \"Cliff responded very, very quickly. He's really on top of his business. And I also want you to know that he shows up,\" she says. Her testimony underscores the trust and hallmark dependability of Bressler's approach, illustrating how effective communication is woven through every interaction. Moreover, Bressler's flexibility and responsiveness are particularly valued in unexpected situations, which Liz experienced firsthand. \"It was a Sunday. I sent him a text. He showed up that day at five o'clock in the afternoon,\" she says, impressed by his commitment to resolve urgent issues promptly, a rare quality that fosters loyal customer relationships. Bressler's influence extends beyond individual gardens, impacting the local community through his service and environmental stewardship. In fact, he says he has \"turned down a lot of business in really great areas\" because it would take him 45 minutes to get there. This selective approach underscores his commitment to being available for his local clients and minimizing environmental impacts associated with longer commutes. Nature's Friends is also deeply integrated into the community, participating in local initiatives and building relationships that reinforce a collaborative and supportive local network. \"I found it a lot easier to manage myself with the client and the three guys that work full time for me,\" Bressler says of his desire for autonomy, which allows him to engage more profoundly with local projects and community efforts.

        "body": "I spent 14 years at Google and YouTube \u2014 long enough to watch those companies go from scrappy upstarts to careful giants. I always prided myself on being quick to act and adapt, but by the end of my time in Big Tech, these traits weren't always seen as positive. We typically spent months, even years, building out commercialization strategies \u2014 getting customer feedback and buy-in across the organization before executing. Often, managers told me to slow down. So when I left Big Tech in 2021 to found my software company, Digiphy, I thought I was ready. In retrospect, I had no idea. I knew startups moved fast, but I didn't realize how fast. At Google, my \"move fast\" mentality still allowed for strategic deliberations and data-driven decisions over several months.
