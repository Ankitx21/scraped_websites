        "body": "Exoticca , a leading travel tech platform for multi-day tour packages, has announced that it has closed a \u20ac60 million Series D round led by Quadrille Capital, the global investment platform focusing on high-growth technology companies, with the participation from new investors including All Iron and ICF and existing investors 14W, Mangrove, Bonsai, Sabadell and Aldea. This latest injection of funding will allow Exoticca to develop its platform, leveraging AI to improve product offering, customer experience and boost its partners\u2019 profitability. The company is focused on building a leading global brand and opening in new markets, accelerating the adoption of the platform by both traditional travel agencies, as well as other online travel partners. Multi-day tour packages, a sector worth over \u20ac100 billion, is one of the last segments of the travel industry still dominated by traditional tour operators with very low levels of digitisation. This prevents travel agencies from offering real-time pricing and availability for complex packages and, as a result, customers experience a cumbersome and time-consuming purchasing process. Exoticca\u2019s bespoke technology connects all the different services (flights, hotels, meals, transfers, transportation and activities) required to book multi-day tours, connecting local companies at destination with travel agencies and other online players and therefore provides the broadest scope for tour package distribution. By digitising all parts of the booking process, Exoticca has cut the process of booking complex long-haul trips down to just minutes and can guarantee its customers the best prices, bringing costs down by around 30% compared to competitors. Pere Vall\u00e8s, CEO at Exoticca, said: \u201cWhile the rest of the travel industry has become digitised, the multi-day tour space has remained stagnant, with customers stuck with inconsistent, time-consuming booking experiences. Exoticca\u2019s mission is to bring multi-day tour packages into the digital age, making dream trips accessible and affordable to everyone. The new funding will accelerate our vision and allow us to substantially increase our investment in technology, product and growth.\u201d Alejandra Duran Gil, Partner at Quadrille Capital, added: \u201cExoticca is revolutionising the travel booking experience worldwide, significantly enhancing efficiency and affordability for travellers. Exoticca\u2019s strong financial foundation and the team\u2019s exceptional execution are at the heart of our investment thesis. We are looking forward to supporting the company in its next phase of growth, leveraging our technology and financial expertise to contribute to its continued success.\u201d Exoticca has more than doubled its sales year-on-year since 2015, becoming the digital category leader and selling trips to over 70 destinations worldwide to travellers in 8 markets (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico and Colombia) directly and through a network of travel and non-travel online and offline partners. The platform also enhances customers\u2019 travel experience through a Travel Concierge App and a comprehensive real-time monitoring and automated response system for all the services included in the package."

        "body": "NetFabric , an ETH Zurich spin-off pioneering advancements in network observability, announced the successful closure of a \u20ac2 million pre-seed funding round. The investment, led by Founderful and Playfair Capital, marks a significant milestone in NetFabric\u2019s mission to transform the landscape of network monitoring. The funding will drive the development of NetFabric\u2019s groundbreaking network observability platform, accelerating development to meet the evolving needs of a $197 billion industry increasingly dependent on robust network performance; simultaneously, NetFabric is expanding its team and seeking candidates for key roles, while inviting potential design partners to reach out for collaboration. While the network monitoring industry grapples with persistent challenges, downtime remains a critical issue for enterprises worldwide. The financial repercussions of network outages are staggering, with even short disruptions translating into multimillion-dollar losses. For instance, Amazon reported a$34 million revenue loss from just one hour of downtime in 2021 . Beyond revenue losses, downtime disrupts operations, ties up skilled engineers in troubleshooting tasks, and jeopardizes customer trust. \u201cCurrent monitoring tools only provide basic insights into the complex inner workings of networks,\u201d explained Prof. Laurent Vanbever, Co-Founder and Chief Scientist of NetFabric. \u201cThey often rely on fragmented data sources, leading to false positives and inadequate problem resolution. Consequently, these tools frequently fail to deliver timely and accurate insights into network issues.\u201d As a result, extensive manual troubleshooting is often necessary to pinpoint the root causes of problems, requiring engineers to spend considerable time deciphering alerts and navigating misleading signals. This not only prolongs downtime but also exacerbates operational inefficiencies. NetFabric is set to disrupt the industry, tackling these challenges with a groundbreaking approach to network observability. Unlike traditional solutions, NetFabric seamlessly merges observations coming from a wide range of network sources (such as routing information, forwarding tables, device configurations, or logs) into one coherent knowledge base. As a result, it delivers actionable intelligence, offering a comprehensive and accurate understanding of network issues while effectively managing the flood of alerts from conventional tools. This dual approach allows NetFabric to innovate on both fronts, offering a comprehensive view of large, complex networks, incorporating all relevant data sources, and providing precise alerts when issues arise. By minimizing false-positive alerts and optimizing resource allocation, organizations can mitigate downtime risks and maintain operational continuity. \u201cOur mission is to empower enterprises with a comprehensive understanding of their networks,\u201d said Benjamin Bichsel, Co-founder and CEO of NetFabric. \u201cBy eliminating the guesswork in network troubleshooting, we enable businesses to redirect engineering resources towards innovation and growth.\u201d NetFabric is powered by a team of experts with deep expertise in network monitoring and AI. Co-founders Dr. Tobias B\u00fchler and Prof. Laurent Vanbever bring more than a decade of research experience in analyzing computer networks, complemented by Dr. Benjamin Bichsel and Prof. Martin Vechev, whose contributions in AI and programming paradigms have earned global recognition. Marlene Brakhane and Boris Paskalev round out the team with extensive business acumen and a successful track record in entrepreneurship."

To stay at the front of a fast-developing endurance landscape, Maurten combines that science-led approach alongside feedback from athletes in real-world situations. This diligence allows for a vision that also seeks opportunities outside sport. An exploration of how Hydrogel Technology could benefit the medical arena, as well as driving forward female-specific fueling research, are now important objectives for the Swedish-based brand. The addition of influence from IRIS Ventures will accelerate this expansion. Montse Suarez, Founder and Managing Partner of IRIS Ventures, commented: \u201cMaurten is a game changer and has, from the outset, redefined athletic performance through world class innovation in the sports nutrition category, seamlessly marrying product excellence with brand uniqueness and edge. The company consistently delivers on their ambitious plans and we are thrilled to join forces with Olof and team.\u201d  Florian Wojewodzki, Partner of IRIS Ventures, added: \u201cFueling is so mission-critical to performance, that elite endurance athletes are incredibly discerning with what they consume. Credibility is vital. Maurten\u2019s long and growing list of professional athletes is testament to the efficacy of its products and uncompromising focus on innovation. In this context, we are extremely excited to be partnering with Maurten and look forward to supporting them in this next phase of growth.\u201d"

Plum has ambitious plans for the rest of Europe too, having recently launched ETFs for EU customers and partnered up with Eurobank to accelerate its growth in the region. The app\u2019s goal is to reach hundreds of thousands of customers in Greece by the end of 2027. As part of the strategic cooperation of Plum with Eurobank, the latter will introduce Plum to its customers. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on what\u2019s next and how to get even more people maximising their money with Plum. Following the success of Cash ISA in the UK and ETFs in Europe, we\u2019re well-placed to reach profitability which is a major and important milestone for us.

Anastasios Economou, Founding Partner of iGrow Venture Capital, said: \u201ciGrow is always looking for transformative ideas such as Plum\u2019s. Making savings solutions accessible to all, not just high-net-worth individuals, is a democratisation and revolution in the industry. We are excited to see the expansion across Europe and Greece. We have full confidence in the Plum team\u2019s capacity to keep expanding.\u201d"

The funding will support the further development of its AI training platform, which aims to provide a more personalized and empathetic training experience for runners. The Berlin-based startup\u2019s mission is to help people achieve their individual training goals and lead a more sustainably active and fulfilling life. At the heart of the company is the desire to marry science-based training with a sense of community. The team\u2019s research indicated that people weren\u2019t reaching their goals due to a lack of statistics or workouts, but because either their plans lacked flexibility, or they didn\u2019t have the support network when they needed it. These are two key issues that TRAIT is addressing, so that when life gets in the way, nobody gets left behind. Rebranded as TRAIT, the startup has relaunched its training app for runners. The previous version of the app achieved significant growth \u2013 the downloads increased by 178% annually \u2013 by convincing with highly individualized running training plans and a virtual coach. Building on this, the team around founders Raphael Jung and Matthias Ettrich aims to provide runners with even more tailored support. Since 2021, the company operated under the name twaiv and focused on AI-generated, adaptive training plans, before relaunching under the name TRAIT in July 2024. Raphael Jung, CEO of TRAIT, said: \u201cWith TRAIT, we have developed an app that is as empathetic and understanding as a human coach would be. We help people get back into sport. We combine sports science and AI training with real social, mutual supportiveness. With the help of HTGF, selected business angels from better ventures and other private investors, we are ready to revolutionize the way people think about being fit.\u201d The seed funding enables TRAIT to realize their vision of an empathetic and adaptive training environment that is not only focused on performance, but also on the well-being of the runners. The founders want to set a new industry standard by emphasising the importance of human interaction and social support. Johannes Dierkes, Investment Manager at HTGF, added: \u201cWe are excited about TRAIT\u2019s vision and approach to creating an empathetic and adaptive AI training platform for athletes. It\u2019s designed to strengthen individuals not just physically, but also mentally.\u201d"

        "body": "Speaksee , a speech recognition app that allows hearing-impaired and deaf people to participate in group conversations, announced it has raised over \u20ac1 million. The funding was provided by the impact fund NoorderImpact and various angel investors and will be used for international expansion and the development of new technology for more inclusivity in society. The group of angels include the founders of the Dutch unicorn DataSnipper, Jonas Ruyter and Kai Bakker, and angel investors who participated through Rabobank\u2019s Money Meets Ideas network. In addition, \u20ac240,000 of previously raised convertible loans was converted into equity capital. The funding round was supported by Generous Minds and Zebra Legal. The funding will be used for Speaksee\u2019s expansion into the UK, Switzerland, Denmark, and Norway. These countries were chosen because they offer good reimbursement options for assistive devices for people with disabilities. In addition, Speaksee is currently assessing its opportunities for expansion into Germany. Backed by its financiers, Speaksee will also further develop its innovative technology to make it applicable in more situations. The company is currently working on solutions to make event locations for gatherings such as lectures and conferences, auditoriums, funeral homes and churches accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing through AI-based subtitling and translation technology. Finally, the company is also looking to develop new applications of its technology to improve inclusivity for non-native speakers. Sjoerd Zijlstra of NoorderImpact said: \u201cSpeaksee matches very well with our goal to empower excluded groups in social situations. Its team is driven and has a strong connection to the target group. Therefore, we can\u2019t think of a better company to make this initiative successful.\u201d Taking part in group conversations is very difficult for hearing-impaired and deaf people, in both business- as well as private situations. Due to multiple people participating in conversation, it\u2019s challenging for them to follow what is being said, and who is saying what. Therefore, a lot of information is being missed. Since 2022, Speaksee has ensured hearing-impaired and deaf people can actively participate in group conversations. Founder Jari Hazelebach and his team developed an app that converts the spoken word into written text, distinguishing what\u2019s being said by the different speakers. Each of the up to nine conversation participants receives a small microphone with a color attached. These colors are integrated into the transcripts on the screen of the hearing-impaired or deaf person. In the process, any background noise gets filtered out. As a result, they are not only able to follow the conversation but also get insight into who contributed what. Founder Jari Hazelebach commented: \u201cNoorderImpact is one of the few investors that has included social inclusion as a company pillar. We are extremely pleased with the confidence of our financiers in us and our technology. The funding raised brings us one step closer to our goal: a society where everyone can actively participate in conversations and interaction, in any situation.\u201d Meanwhile, Speaksee is used by hundreds of deaf and hearing-impaired people in the Netherlands. It is also used by several companies such as KPN, Rabobank, PwC, the central government, and several Dutch municipalities. Since last week, Speaksee has been officially approved to be reimbursed by the Dutch Employee Insurance Agency (UWV), making it the first speech recognition app with this recognition."

        "body": "Agrobiomics , a Danish agtech developing sustainable biological solutions for agriculture, has raised \u20ac4 million from NOON Ventures to bring the most potent abiotic stress protectant, called Fortify, to the market \u2013 making plants climate resilient. A solution that can save more than 100 million tons of CO2 annually and save food worth up to \u20ac90 billion. Founded in 2022 with a mission of making agriculture resilient to climate change, Agrobiomics has developed a biological solution, Fortify, which can increase plant robustness against climate-induced stress such as drought and salinity. With financial support from the BioInnovation Institute of \u20ac1.4 million, Agrobiomics\u2019 solution has already shown a high impact on sustainable agriculture for securing global food supply, and the company will now continue to invest in further trials across different crops, i.e., soy, corn, and tomatoes, and across various geographies, i.e., Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. Ejner Bech Jensen, CEO of Agrobiomics, said: \u201cIn the past two years, our excellent team has built Agrobiomics from scratch, validated the IP with strong field results, and attracted significant partnerships. We have been greatly helped by BII, that is an incubator backed by the Novo foundation. This means we are on track to help farmers tackle challenges like drought and salinity, contributing to a significant CO 2 reduction of more than 100 million tons annually, and potentially even enabling soil reclamation. We aim to lead in BioAg, providing biological solutions for both abiotic and biotic stress, and aspire to replace pesticides with our natural, stable Streptomyces metabolites.\u201d Today, global food security is threatened due to several climate and geopolitical factors, as well as the availability and affordability of some crop inputs for farmers. Climate change is accelerating the loss of global arable land available, through drought and salinity stress, and significantly reducing farming yields. According to the USDA, drought and salinity conditions have an impact estimated around \u20ac 90 B per year in yield losses. Approximately 75% of the global population will be affected by drought by 2050, which necessitates the need for new agricultural solutions that can enable farmers to grow more for less. Agrobiomics\u2019 technology is derived from nature itself, tapping into millions of years of evolution. The unfair advantage is the unprecedented low dose needed per hectare, which enables farmers to grow food sustainably, reliably, and profitably. Across various crops within both broad acre and fruit and vegetables, Agrobiomics\u2019 first product, Fortify, has shown an ability to increase yield substantially, while increasing plant robustness under drought and salinity conditions. For soy and corn, Agrobiomics have already progressed to field trials and seen impressive yield data. Additionally, the technology is easy to integrate in existing agricultural practices, offering a true \u2018plug-n-play\u2019 solutions for farmers, creating a market opportunity for Fortify projected at more than $2 billion. Theis Malmborg, Partner at NOON Ventures, added: \u201c The agricultural industry faces significant challenges to meet the requirements of a growing population, and the impact of climate-induced stress on our natural systems is adding to the pressing issues of the industry. Agrobiomics has the potential to become a key enabler in building a climate resilient agricultural system with a biological solution that plugs directly into existing supply chain and agronomic practices. We are proud to be backing the team and look forward to work together with them on advancing the technology and bring its products to the market.\u201d"
