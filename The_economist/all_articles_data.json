        "body": "T\no those who question his readiness to be prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer has a message: look at how he has run the opposition. “I have changed this Labour Party, dragged it back to service, and I will do exactly the same for Westminster,” he told a rally early on in the general-election campaign. It is true that the best clues to his modus operandi are found in the way in which his party has been slowly remade. Less certain is how well this method would work if he leads Labour to victory on July 4th.\nThe transformation of the party under Sir Keir has been remarkable. In the last election in 2019, under Jeremy Corbyn, a leftist, it won 202 seats, its lowest total since 1935. The following year, with Sir Keir installed as the party’s new leader, a report by Labour Together, a pro-Starmer caucus, warned that a long-term seepage of working-class support could cost it dozens more seats. Campaign funds were being consumed by investigations into allegations of antisemitism and of data-protection breaches, and by litigation from former employees. The tentacles of the hard left were wrapped tightly around the party.\nMore on this:\nHow the Labour Party could end Britain’s stagnation\nSir Keir Starmer: bureaucrat first, politician second\nThe narcissism of minor differences, Labour Party edition  \nFor Sir Keir’s circle, the job of reclaiming the party for the centre-left began with a cultural critique. Mr Corbyn, as they saw it, was merely the symptom of a party whose priorities had become warped. It had elevated its members’ views over the public’s. A party founded as an “instrument of power” for the working classes had become an “expression of virtue” for progressive activists. Labour was more of a t-shirt than a party of government.\nBeing serious about regaining power implied several things. Labour had to try to get back into office in a single parliamentary term: those who claimed it would take a decade were dodging hard choices. It had to abandon the fatalism that said Labour’s old heartlands in northern England and Scotland had been lost to the Tories and the Scottish National Party. And Sir Keir would need to breach Labour norms about prioritising party unity.\nTo understand how he went about this task, you have to look at his career before politics. Sir Keir only entered Parliament in 2015, when he was already in his 50s. Before then, as a barrister working at the frontiers of human-rights law, he took on cases in areas such as the death penalty that he thought would lead to systemic change. And as the head of Britain’s public prosecutor, he styled himself as a reformist administrator who improved the service in an era of spending cuts.\nA conventional politician, says Tom Baldwin, a former Labour official and author of “Keir Starmer: the Biography”, will set out a grand vision and then compromise with reality as obstacles emerge. Sir Keir, by contrast, tends to start with the most obvious mechanisms, and becomes iteratively more radical if they are found wanting. It is, says Mr Baldwin, a “common-law” approach, “a series of judgments based on values which slowly forms the jurisprudence, not a Napoleonic code derived from some great principles”.\nThe remaking of Labour operated via a ratchet. “He’s not iconoclastic and he doesn’t go around saying, ‘I’m going to smash things up’,” is the verdict of one party official. “He always says ‘let’s give everyone the benefit of the doubt, lead them properly, put systems in place’.” It was only after a by-election defeat in Hartlepool in May 2021 that he became convinced that Labour needed stronger medicine.\nThe process is oddly unnarrated. When he was in opposition Sir Tony Blair made great hay of his largely symbolic reforms to Labour’s “Clause IV”, which ended the party’s constitutional commitment to nationalisation. Take the more consequential changes that Sir Keir secured to the party’s rulebook in 2021, which weakened the influence of Labour members. These reforms were tabled at the party’s conference without fanfare, and when they passed, he did not bother to mention them in his speech afterwards. His opponents, like unwitting frogs, were boiled slowly. Sir Keir’s leadership began with left-wing Labour mps in the shadow cabinet; it has since seen the expulsion of Mr Corbyn and a last-minute purge of firebrand candidates in favour of Starmerite loyalists.\nOn ideology, Sir Keir has travelled light. The most consistent thread has been a self-confessed desire to get the party into power. As a candidate to lead the party in 2020, Sir Keir wooed the Labour selectorate with a Corbyn-lite pitch (“Defend migrants’ rights”; “No more illegal wars”). But once in the job, he changed his focus to target swing voters in the provinces. One Labour official uses another legal analogy: that of a barrister taking on briefs for different clients and different juries. His defenders argue that this flexibility is a virtue: whereas Mr Corbyn took rigid positions on every question, Sir Keir is deliberative. “It’s not about the colour of the machine, or how inspiring it is, or whether it is modern or old, but whether it works,” says Mr Baldwin.\nIn some respects, Sir Keir can apply this template to government. As with the overhaul of the party, a cultural critique serves as the starting-point. Britain’s problems, in Sir Keir’s telling, stem from a governing class that has become self-serving and inert; under Labour there would be an ascetic emphasis on ethics. Another change in focus would be needed, this time from swing voters to the country at large. The ratchet would be required, too. There is a gulf in Labour’s manifesto between its five long-term “missions”, such as achieving the highest sustained productivity growth in the g7, and the more trifling measures it has identified as “first steps”. He will again need to become more radical.\nThe big question is how well a project to save the Labour Party can translate into government. Many of its positions—hawkishness on fiscal deficits, toughness on crime—have been more about closing gaps in Labour’s electoral appeal than about providing axioms to govern by. The lack of a well-understood project is why internal party disputes—such as over workers’ rights, or the scale of a green-subsidy programme—have been resolved with painful slowness. In government Sir Keir cannot afford to be as sluggish.\nSimilarly, the absence of a narrative is fine when fighting for internal control of a party; it is a problem when trying to steer a government composed of hundreds of mps and thousands of civil servants. Sir Keir has successfully transformed his party through a mixture of pragmatism and ratcheting ruthlessness. Remaking an entire country will be a lot harder. ■\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

        "body": "S\no much has changed since that day in October 1982 when the huge oak doors of Britain’s House of Commons swung open and I walked into a packed chamber to swear my oath of allegiance to the Queen. I felt completely out of place, dressed in my red velvet maternity dress, as I took my seat among a sea of men in grey suits. And indeed I was.\nThe House I entered as Labour mp for Peckham, in south London, was 97% men. For those who felt that a woman’s place was in the home, not in the Commons, the 3% who were women could be safely ignored. But thanks to the campaign to make Parliament more representative, the one I am leaving is now 35% women—and that percentage is set to rise after next month’s general election. A pregnant mp is no longer an oddity, and in 2018 we introduced the first ever baby leave for mps.\nThat is just one of the many positive changes that have transformed the Commons since I was first elected—even as some of the fundamental traditions that govern Parliament remain intact. We still refer to each other not by name but as “the honourable member” for their constituency. The Speaker of the House still presides and chooses whom to call to speak.\nThat said, the practice of “bobbing”—standing every time another member stops speaking, in order to catch the Speaker’s eye—can instead be the raising of an arm, for members with disabilities. And although there are still significant battles of access in our ancient Palace of Westminster, no one thinks twice about a member using a wheelchair. That marks a big change from nearly three decades ago, when the first wheelchair-using mp had quite a struggle to get into the chamber and be heard.\nSo it is that Parliament has become more inclusive, and more representative across dimensions of gender, disability and race. No one should get to be an mp solely because of their identity, but it is clear that a heterogeneous Parliament is better for decision-making and better for the public, as each voter should be able to see someone like them on the green benches of the Commons. Their inclusion is a democratic imperative that is never more important than at a time when many say our politics is out of touch.\nWith the diversification of Parliament has come change to the political agenda. We still debate macroeconomics, industry and defence. But we also now argue far more about child care, reducing black maternal mortality rates and domestic violence.\nOne of the big changes has been a substantial increase in cross-party collaboration among women, of which there was little when I was first elected, for two reasons. First, back then there were hardly any Conservative women mps. And second, I would have felt nervous about working with members from other parties, especially Tories. I was regarded with so much suspicion by so many on my own side that if I had tried to reach across the aisle, many Labour colleagues would have said “Look what happens when you get a woman: she works with the Conservatives.”\nOf course, much has changed outside those oak doors, too. It used to be the case that the main way for mps to communicate with constituents was by putting leaflets through doors, as voters didn’t have computers or smartphones (and many didn’t even have landlines). For an mp to get media coverage in their constituency, they had to persuade a local newspaper that their policy stance or an event they were holding was a news story. With a handful of overwhelmingly male editors acting as gatekeepers for the political debate in Westminster, women mps in particular struggled to be heard on the national stage.\nNow we reach our constituents directly and immediately through social media. That is good for democracy but has brought with it a torrent of abuse and threats. Some mps have said they fear speaking or voting on an issue for fear of a social-media pile-on. That risk is immeasurably worse for women, especially if they are young or black. And it is not to be ignored: two mps have been murdered in the past eight years. When I was Labour’s deputy leader I would hold “Harriet in the high street” events, posting in advance on social media that I would be chatting to shoppers about anything that was on their minds. I wouldn’t dream of doing that now.\nWhen candidates can’t go to pre-announced events, democracy is pushed into retreat and everyone loses out. We need a proper action plan involving all political parties, the police, social-media companies and the public to end online abuse and attacks on mps and candidates out campaigning or holding surgeries in their constituencies. This is not free speech or protest, it is thuggery, and no one in any walk of life should have to put up with that.\nAnother worrying trend has been the increase in ministers’ attacks on civil servants in the media. It is never acceptable for government ministers to blame civil servants for their own failings—it is divisive and undermines democracy. One of the things I’m looking forward to with a new government is a resetting of the standards in public life. The rule of law, the sovereignty of Parliament and the impartiality of the civil service are key to making the country successful.\nThe forthcoming election is likely to usher in the highest number of newly elected mps in British history. It will be up to them to remake Parliament in a way that preserves our essential democratic roots but continues to modernise the country’s politics while rebuilding public trust. Against a background of deepening alienation and growing disillusion with democracy, there is no political task more urgent. ■\nHarriet Harman has served as a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party for more than 40 years, including in a variety of cabinet roles both in government and in opposition. She will be standing down at the general election on July 4th.",

The cutesy emoticon is a staple of a certain corner of the internet, in which grown-ups speak to each other in an infantile tone (“I’m just a smol bean”) and adopt feigned helplessness.\nWhat is grating enough online is much worse coming from a g7 government. The Conservatives, who have spent 14 years running Britain, increasingly subscribe to a narrative that they were a mere bit-part player, rather than its main actor. Gazing upon a dying Conservative administration in 1993, Lord Lamont, who had recently been sacked as chancellor, accused Sir John Major’s government of being “in office but not in power”. What was once an attack has now become the party’s principal defence: the Conservatives may have been in office, but they were never in power. Call it UwU Conservatism.\nSee our other coverage of Britain’s election, including our poll tracker, updated daily\nBuck-passing starts with the historiography of the Tories’ many years in government. Sure, the histories will say that the Conservative Party entered power in 2010 and, almost certainly, left it in 2024. But between 2010 and 2015, the Conservatives had to share power with the Liberal Democrats. A brief interlude with a 12-seat majority was interrupted by the Brexit referendum in 2016. After a botched election, Theresa May struggled on with a hung parliament. True, Boris Johnson won a mighty majority of 80 seats in 2019 but a pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine stymied what he could do with it. That the errors of each era—undermining public services via austerity, leaving the European Union or putting Mr Johnson in charge during a time of national emergency—were Conservative-made is ignored. UwU.\nHelplessness has now become an electoral strategy. Some polls suggest that Labour could end up with a majority bigger than any in the modern era. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, has worried aloud about the threat of a Labour “supermajority”. “It doesn’t do the country any good to have that kind of size majority,” he chided. Party elders joined in. “It would be parliamentary democracy in its weakest form since the 1930s,” warned Lord Hague, a former party leader turned columnist. Pwease halp.\nTalk of a “supermajority” is constitutional nonsense. No magic thresholds exist in the British system. In some countries, a two-thirds majority bestows a host of constitution-shredding powers upon the holder. In Britain a majority of one carries as much legal force as one of 180. Whining about a supermajority provides the perfect cover for the Conservatives’ lack of achievements in the past five years. If only the Conservatives had enjoyed a bigger majority than 80 seats, the government would have more achievements to its name. The majority was just too smol.\nIf the Conservatives are puny in their own minds, then Labour is mighty. The Conservatives have taken to warning of two decades of socialist imperium under Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party. Fears that a government will go wild with executive power, gerrymandering the voting system and stacking the House of Lords, are as much projection as anything else. The Conservatives repeatedly tried to drag authority to the centre. Brexit-related legislation, for example, was littered with “Henry VIII” powers, designed to allow government ministers to hack away laws at will. But they have gone largely unused by the Conservatives. A new government may be more ruthless. If Labour does decide to run amok, the Tories will be partly to blame.\nEven the lightest legislation proved too heavy for a smol government. A proposed ban on foie gras never became law. Limits on plastic wet wipes also went nowhere. When asked about his legacy, Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, alighted on his plan to ban smoking for anyone born after January 1st 2009. Yet the smoking bill is not law because Mr Sunak himself abruptly halted its progress by calling an election he will surely lose. “That’s the type of leadership that I bring,” he said, altogether too accurately. This lack of legislative legacy is, naturally, someone else’s fault. “Blairite legislation has tied the hands of the government,” complained Miriam Cates, a backbench Tory mp. Less UwU, more (>_<).\nMeekness infects the immediate political ambitions of the Conservative Party, too. It is petrified about Nigel Farage and Reform uk hoovering up voters to its right, yet seems to assume that winning voters to its left is impossible. The election result would have to turn out only slightly worse than the most damning polls for Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, to be the one facing Sir Keir during Prime Minister’s Questions. But when it comes to liberal Britain—or indeed anyone who is not a pensioner in a town on England’s eastern seaboard—the Conservatives have all but given up.\nUwU Conservatism has many weaknesses. Mr Sunak’s early departure from a D-Day anniversary memorial in France earlier this month played badly enough. But journalists at itv, a broadcaster, made it worse by showing Mr Sunak moaning that the event “ran over” when apologising for being late for his interview with them. Idle chit-chat before an interview would usually be off-limits for an all-powerful prime minister. But for one on the way out, it is fair game. In politics, smol beans get trod on.\nC’maahn I’m a little guy, I’m just a little guy\nPretending to be puny is the government’s only defence. A government that pledged to cut taxes and cut immigration has done the opposite. Austerity hollowed out the state, rather than slimming it. The Conservative Party’s one definitive achievement—leaving the eu—was a bad idea, badly executed and is, understandably, barely mentioned in the campaign. Rather than stand by this record, the Tories ask for pity. Big government is rarely a good idea, but smol government is much worse.

Between 11am and 7pm, the sunniest hours in a sunny country, prices often loiter near zero on wholesale markets (see chart). Even in Germany, which by no reasonable definition is a sunny country, but which has plenty of wind, wholesale prices were negative in 301 of the 8,760 tradable hours last year.\nAs solar panels and wind farms take over Europe, the question facing the continent’s policymakers is what to do with all the power they produce. Ultra-low—and indeed negative—prices suggest that it is not being put to good use at present, reflecting failures in both infrastructure and regulation. There are three main ways that firms and regulators could establish a more efficient market: sending energy to areas where there is no surplus, shifting demand to hours when energy is plentiful, and storing energy as electricity, fuel or heat.\nchart: the economist\nThe need to make such shifts will only become more pressing. Europe’s renewables boom is bigger than elsewhere in the rich world. Last year the continent installed roughly twice as much fresh capacity as America, with 56 gigawatts (gw) of new solar power and 17gw of new wind power, which the latest figures suggest will be exceeded this year. By 2030, 43% of the eu’s total energy consumption will have to come from renewables, according to the latest rules, up from 23% in 2022.\nSending energy to places without surpluses would require a better connected grid. entso-e, a club of European grid operators, estimates that improved international links would ensure that 42 terawatt-hours a year of otherwise wasted electricity would be put to use in 2040. That is more than Denmark’s current annual consumption. According to Bruegel, a think-tank, such a grid would also need 20-30% less storage and backup capacity.\nThe problem is that grid extensions take time and meet local opposition. As a result, energy firms have resorted to putting them underground, which raises costs. Extensions also prompt arguments. When a connection is established, the market with lower electricity prices will inevitably export power to the one with higher prices. Even if both sides benefit from the transaction overall, on one side the beneficiary may be electricity producers and on the other side it may be consumers, with the other group losing out in both places. On June 18th Sweden cancelled the Hansa PowerBridge, a 700-megawatt connection to Germany, over fears it would raise electricity prices for domestic consumers.\nThe next option for policymakers is to shift demand. This does not mean persuading everyone to take showers during their lunch breaks, when the sun is at its brightest. Instead, the idea is to move flexible sources of demand, such as electric-vehicle (ev) charging and district-heating buffers, into hours of abundant energy. Doing so requires smart meters that measure not only how much energy is used, but also when it is used, and which thus allow prices to vary accordingly. So far, however, countries are making slow progress installing these devices. Although almost everyone has a smart meter in Spain, hardly anyone does in Germany.\nExisting grid-pricing regimes are another obstacle when it comes to shifting demand. Consider Karoline, a giant kettle in Hamburg, Germany, that stands ready to transform surplus electricity into heat for as many as 20,000 households. It must pay full monthly network charges, even if it is employed only briefly, which makes it too costly to switch on most of the time. As a consequence, it often sits idle, even as local wind turbines are turned off to prevent the grid from overloading. Meanwhile, consumers face similar problems. They tend to pay network charges at fixed rates, regardless of when energy is taken from the grid. The eu is pushing member states and markets in a more flexible direction, but upgrading regulations, pricing methods and grid technology takes time.\nCould better storage solve the problem? In Vantaa, Finland, the local energy company is about to dig a hole the size of 440 Olympic swimming pools into the bedrock beneath the town. This will be filled with water heated to 140°C, which will store 90 gigawatt-hours of heat, an amount sufficient to keep the town toasty for a year. Other firms are making greater use of batteries for shorter-term storage. Unfortunately, such schemes are once again hindered by existing energy-market structures. When it comes to things such as congestion management and frequency control, markets are typically built on the expectation that backup capacity will arrive from conventional gas-fired plants. “The efficient use of surplus electricity is not considered and not encouraged in Europe,” sighs Julian Jansen of Fluence, which makes energy-storage products.\nWith better incentives, policymakers would also be able to bring household batteries into play. Jochen Schwill of Spot My Energy, a startup, reckons that a German home with batteries might receive €600 ($650) a year if it was able to store energy for the grid. evs could also play a part. They are, in essence, two devices in one: a car and a battery. Octopus, a British energy provider, recently rolled out a tariff that offers free charging if the firm can decide when the car charges and sometimes feed energy from its battery into the grid. Used more widely, such tariffs would both help soak up surplus energy and by cutting costs make evs a more attractive purchase.\nWithout better incentives, Europe will struggle to use growing amounts of surplus energy. That, in turn, will lower profits for investors in renewables. In May the “capture rate” of German solar panels—the share of the average daily energy price that they earned—dropped to 50%, down from 80% three years earlier, according to calculations by Julien Jomaux, an energy consultant. Ultra-cheap power is something to be celebrated. But as Europe is now discovering, it can be tough to exploit. ■\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

In every other continent the vast majority of people have access to electricity. In Africa 600m people, 43% of the total, cannot readily light their homes or charge their phones. And those who nominally have grid electricity find it as reliable as a Scottish summer. More than three-quarters of African firms experience outages; two-fifths say electricity is the main constraint on their business. If other sub-Saharan African countries had enjoyed power as reliable as South Africa’s from 1995 to 2007, then the continent’s rate of real gdp growth per person would have been two percentage points higher, more than doubling the actual rate, according to one academic paper. Since then South Africa has also had erratic electricity. So-called “load-shedding” is probably the main reason why the economy has shrunk in four of the past eight quarters.\nSolar power is increasingly seen as the solution. Last year Africa installed a record amount of photovoltaic (pv) capacity (though this still made up just 1% of the total added worldwide), notes the African Solar Industry Association (afsia), a trade group. Globally most solar pv is built by utilities, but in Africa 65% of new capacity over the past two years has come from large firms contracting directly with developers. These deals are part of a decentralised revolution that could be of huge benefit to African economies.\nRead more in our series on solar energy:\nThe exponential growth of solar power will change the world\nEssay: Solar power is going to be huge\nChina’s giant solar industry is in turmoil\nGround zero for the revolution is South Africa. Last year saw a record number of blackouts imposed by Eskom, the state-run utility, whose dysfunctional coal-fired power stations regularly break down or operate at far below capacity. Fortunately, as load-shedding was peaking, the costs of solar systems were plummeting. Between 2019 and 2023 the cost of panels fell by 15%, having already declined by almost 90% in the 2010s. Meanwhile battery storage systems now cost about half as much as five years ago. Industrial users pay 20-40% less per unit when buying electricity from private project developers than on the cheapest Eskom tariff. In the past two calendar years the amount of solar capacity in South Africa rose from 2.8gw to 7.8gw, notes afsia, excluding that installed on the roofs of suburban homes. All together South Africa’s solar capacity could now be almost a fifth of that of Eskom’s coal-fired power stations (albeit those still have a higher “capacity factor”, or ability to produce electricity around the clock). The growth of solar is a key reason why there has been less load-shedding in 2024.\nOther Africans often point out that they have had load-shedding for much longer than South Africans. About half of African firms rely on diesel generators; in Nigeria their capacity is almost four times what the grid can reliably supply. But change is afoot: nearly two-thirds of mines in sub-Saharan Africa produce renewable energy or are in the process of installing renewables. In Nigeria, the phasing out of petrol subsidies last year accelerated a shift to cleaner energy. In a symbolic acquisition in 2022, Shell, an oil giant present in Nigeria since 1937, bought Daystar Power, a startup that has provided solar-power systems to many large domestic businesses.\nOver the past decade the number of startups providing “distributed renewable energy” (dre) has grown at a clip. Industry estimates suggest that more than 400m Africans get electricity from solar home systems and that more than ten times as many “mini-grids”, most of which use solar, were built in 2016-20 than in the preceding five years. In Kenya dre firms employ more than six times as many people as the largest utility. In Nigeria they have created almost as many jobs as the oil and gas industry.\n“The future is an extremely distributed system to an extent that people haven’t fully grasped,” argues Matthew Tilleard of CrossBoundary Group, a firm whose customers range from large businesses to hitherto unconnected consumers. “It’s going to happen here in Africa first and most consequentially.”\nIgnite, which operates in nine African countries, has products that include a basic panel that powers three light bulbs and a phone charger, as well as solar-powered irrigation pumps, stoves and internet routers, and industrial systems. Customers use mobile money to “unlock” a pay-as-you-go meter. Yariv Cohen, Ignite’s ceo, reckons that the typical $3 per month spent by consumers is less than what they previously paid for kerosene and at phone-charging kiosks. He describes how farmers are more productive because they do not have to get home before dark and children are getting better test scores because they study under bulbs. One family in Rwanda used to keep their two cows in their house because they feared rustlers might come in the dark; now the cattle snooze al fresco under an outside lamp and the family gets more sleep.\nIn April the World Bank and the African Development Bank launched a flagship scheme to expand electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa to 300m additional people by 2030. The World Bank suggests that under its most cost-effective scenario roughly half of those would be connected via off-grid, dre systems. But since the costs of solar kits are still prohibitively expensive for some of the poorest people in the world, the bank and donors are planning to subsidise the upfront costs through programmes that pay dre firms to set up in remote rural areas. The bet is that this, together with more policy certainty from governments (around, say, repatriation of profits and future plans for the grid), can bring in more private investment.\nYet there is a limit to how much can be done by avoiding legacy utilities. The World Bank reckons that the most cost-effective way to electrify the other half of its 300m target is by extending existing grids. Many African utilities have monolithic structures—in the jargon, they control the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity—long “unbundled” in other parts of the world. Most are, in effect, insolvent: more than half in sub-Saharan Africa cannot cover their operating expenses, partly because governments insist on setting consumer tariffs below the cost of supply.\nThe spread of solar may make things even worse for them. Some analysts suggest Eskom could enter a “death spiral” as its best customers go off-grid. Other utilities are perhaps even more vulnerable. Kenya Power receives 54% of its revenues from roughly 700 entities, less than 0.01% of its total customers.\nA few utilities are changing with the times. Namibia, one of the sunniest countries, last year made it easier for private producers to sell electricity into the regional power pool. It sees its future role as more of a platform for the buying and selling of electricity than as a generator and distributor. But others are resisting change. Senegal, Mozambique and Tanzania, for instance, still tangle up dre firms in red tape. Other countries are hoping that the “geopolitics of solar” will mean that foreign powers seeking influence in Africa will pay to build the solar plants that their bankrupt utilities cannot otherwise afford, argues one industry veteran. In May Mali, which last year welcomed the Wagner Group of Russian mercenaries, announced that a subsidiary of Rosatom, a Russian energy giant, would build west Africa’s largest solar plant. It is hard to see any purely commercial investor having gone for such a project.\nThat is one eye-catching aspect of Africa’s solar revolution. But most of the continent is undergoing a more subtle—and significant—experiment in decentralised, commercially driven solar power. It is a trend that could both transform African economies and offer lessons to the rest of the world. ■\nSign up to the Analysing Africa, a weekly newsletter that keeps you in the loop about the world’s youngest—and least understood—continent.",

        "body": "W\nhat appears to have been our first article about solar power, in 1955, mostly dealt with water heaters, cooking stoves and the like. But it also noted, “among the more ingenious low powered devices…the Bell Company’s solar battery”—which is to say the first silicon-based solar cell, unveiled by at&t’s Bell Labs the previous year. Indeed we were sufficiently impressed by this “simple-looking apparatus, consisting, in essence, of thin wafers of silicon, specially treated” (and pictured above) that in 1956 we featured it in an encomium to America’s remarkable research record: “Even an account of such diverse achievements as the Salk vaccine, the solar battery, the discovery and synthesis of the “miracle” drugs, the atom-powered submarine and the breeding of Santa Gertrudis cattle, would give only a small hint of work in progress.” (Quite how Santa Gertrudis cattle made it into this hall of fame remains a mystery.)\nFollowing this burst of enthusiasm, The Economist, like almost everyone else not involved in building satellites or installing radio relays in the back of beyond, saw no need to say more on the subject until the oil shocks of the 1970s made alternative sources of energy a hot topic. In 1975 we reported that Vicomte Davignon, the Belgian head of the International Energy Agency, wanted to see industrial countries “encourage the production of more exotic fuels such as shale oil and solar energy”. America’s Energy Research and Development Administration expected solar energy to provide 7% of America’s needs by 2000 and 25% by 2020: “Americans no longer talk of whether, but when, the sun will be a major source of their energy,” we wrote in response. But we feared that the case for solar power in America was “alternately flattered by attention and crushed by indifference”.\nRead more in our series on solar energy:\nThe exponential growth of solar power will change the world\nSolar power is going to be huge\nChina’s giant solar industry is in turmoil\nPrivate firms are driving a revolution in solar power in Africa\nWhen considering Britain’s future energy supplies in 1977, we saw America’s solar enthusiasm, then in the process of being “flattered by attention” as an example to steer clear of. “After the moon programme, it became fashionable to say that, given money, scientists could do anything. It did not work with a cure for cancer, and it may not work with solar energy…it is true that the scientists are making good progress at developing solar cells, but current capital costs are about 25 times the $500 per peak kilowatt hour that is most people’s target.” A reasonable stance, but one undercut by the accompanying contention that fast breeder nuclear reactors and wave power were the way to go.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s our newly minted Science and Technology section kept readers abreast of developments in photovoltaic technologies—including some which now have a distinctly Rube Goldberg feel to them. But the collapse of American funding for alternative energy technologies under Ronald Reagan, and the collapse a few years later of the oil price, dampened our interest.\nEnthusiasm for new energy technologies picked up again in the 1990s with the rise of fears about global warming. The Economist was somewhat sceptical about these concerns, tending to argue that carbon prices and adaptation were the path of reason and heavily subsidised new energy technologies a snare and delusion. When we got interested in particular technologies it tended to be fuel cells and hydrogen that took our fancy. But by 2006 we were reporting that solar power was “ripe for breakthroughs”, and the most promising renewable technology, an assessment based in part on the possibility of moving beyond silicon wafers and in part on the mistaken belief that “Wind turbines will, from now until the end of time, be subject to only incremental improvements: they will become a bit more efficient, a bit cheaper to install, and a bit cheaper to build.” The levelised cost of onshore wind has since dropped markedly.\nThe following year we reported, correctly, that “despite its rapid growth [solar power] will not provide a significant share of the world’s electricity for decades.” But we were unconvinced by the subsidies that were fuelling that rapid growth. In 2008 we explained that such subsidies were “Green, easy and wrong”: “Subsidising clean energy requires politicians to decide on the best way of delivering it, and their judgment is likely to be worse than the market’s. We criticised both America’s huge ethanol subsidies and Germany’s generosity to solar. “Both subsidies promoted the wrong technologies; both wasted taxpayers’ money.” A year later we reported research by New Energy Finance (now Bloombergnef) which found that at the time solar cells required a carbon price of $196 a tonne.\nWe continued—and continue—to criticise subsidies for second-guessing the market and allowing governments to back “winners” which turn out to be losers, such as Solyndra, a solar-power company which went bust despite generous support from the Obama administration. But while finding in 2011 that “the rush to subsidise solar power over the past decade [has been] massively wasteful and squalidly political,” we admitted that “by pushing the price of panels down, [they] have created possibilities that were not there before”, both in “some sunny parts of America” and in developing countries.\nWhile allowing that these were worthwhile markets, we still worried about what large-scale solar might do to electricity grids. The big obstacle we foresaw for solar power, in 2013, was that it would destabilise electric grids and drive away investment. “Utilities are not rewarded for offsetting the variable nature of wind and solar power. Instead, they are shifting out of electricity generation,” we reported in a piece on European utilities entitled “How to lose half a trillion euros”, going on to point out that “this is happening at a time when renewable energy supplies, on average, 22% of Germany’s electricity demand. No one really knows what will happen when renewables reach 35% of the market, as government policy requires in 2020.\nAs we reported a decade later, in 2022, these fears proved overblown. On a visit to 50Hertz, a German utility, our reporter noted “screens show 28% of [the energy flowing through the grid] coming from wind farms and 24% from solar panels. A decade ago the custodians of the grids which keep the rich world’s lights on would have told you this was impossible… The grid 50Hertz oversees is quite capable of running a transmission grid with 50-60% wind and solar power.”■\nCurious about the world?

Yet an urge persists to somehow see the source of the light by which once all things were seen. Central to the world but always moving in the sky, bringing days into being and governing the cycles of the year—it is hard not to see the fascination, even if you sensibly avert your eyes.\nVisual artists, from the prehistoric to the contemporary, provide a safer way for Sun-worshippers and the Sun-curious to deepen their appreciation. As solar power becomes an ever more important energy source around the world, here are seven artworks that also harness the Sun’s energy and deepen its resonance.\nphotograph: photographic archive, national monuments service, government of ireland\nNewgrange. Around 3200BC; Boyne Valley, County Meath, Ireland\nThrough chinks that seem natural but have been perfectly aligned to the geometries of the winter solstice, the Sun creeps in. An intruder and a timekeeper. The ruler of lives. Steadily, the beam widens until the whole interior is lit. At Newgrange it marks the start of the new year and the ever-strengthening Sun. Light fertilises the womb-dark of the chamber. At the caves of Lascaux, in south-western France, it declares the summer solstice and the season’s fullness. Where it enters, the Sun turns the earth floors to hammered fire. There is light enough to paint, at Lascaux, men, hunters and wild oxen. Or, at Newgrange, to carve mesmerising looped spirals and a leafing fern, the plant of rejuvenation. Plants, beasts and men live, and will live again, in the Sun.\nphotograph: holt/smithson foundation and dia art foundation / ars, ny and dacs, london 2024\nSun Tunnels. By Nancy Holt; 1973-1976; Little Pigeon Rd, Great Basin Desert, Utah\nFive thousand years later, such alignment has become industrial. The Land Art movement of the 1960s and 1970s saw some artists use bulldozers, concrete and steel to mount human interventions in the relationships between land, water and sky, at once massive and, in context, hauntingly inconsequential. Nancy Holt brought “the sky down to earth” by passing solstice sunlight down tubes that might have been sewers, one set for winter, one for summer. Brutal concrete evoked an infrastructure on a global scale, but in an arrangement that would have been understandable to men and women measuring the comings and goings of the seasons through the sky throughout human history—and even before it began.\nphotograph: alamy\nImpression/Sunrise. By Claude Monet; 1872; Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris; on display at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris until July 24th 2024; at the National Gallery in Washington, DC from September 8th 2024 to January 19th 2025\nDawn barely breaks outside the window of his hotel on the Grand Quay in Le Havre, and a bearded man is already at his easel. He paints the Sun as no one has done before: it is a rough red ball, which has already dropped its careless colours on the sea. This Sun must burn its way through the fog of the industrial age. Vague chimneys and cranes jostle to obscure it. The sky is smoke, and the water thick as oil. The Sun’s rays are withdrawn: as yet, it illuminates only wisps of cloud. Yet it hangs centrally, or just off-centre, as the plain commander of the scene. Monet calls his painting an impression; from this casual description, a whole artistic genre will spring. He insists that it is not finished yet. And his painter-Sun has not started, let alone finished, the uncreated day.\nphotograph: bridgeman\nBeachy Head Lighthouse (Belle Tout). By Eric Ravilious; 1939; private collection\nThe Sun is barely visible in this painting. Yet it still governs everything. Eric Ravilious, a modern man, boasted that he looked “into the eye of the sun as long as it could be borne” when he worked in the open air. It became one of his beloved yellow things, commonplace as a pat of butter, a beached skiff or a baker’s cart. He loved especially to catch it coming in through glass, entering silent bedrooms and kitchens like a too-familiar friend. Yet the Sun of his woodcuts was an object of worship. It was powerfully geometrical, streaming out parallel rays and with an orb of concentric circles, like a dartboard. Its light fell on the Sussex Downs as regular lattices of lines; it netted the sea. Here at Belle Tout it does the same: Ravilious snares it through the severe panes of the lantern, organising light to light, dangerously and divinely bright.\nBlack Sun, Tungsten Hills, Owens Valley. By Ansel Adams; 1939; in various collections including those of the Art Institute of Chicago, The Yale University Art Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London\nPhotography makes sunlight the artist’s everyday tool as well as his sometime subject. How, where and when the sunlight strikes becomes central to the work, constraining and inspiring the position of lens and eye, the openness of aperture, the choice of film emulsion. Its capture is a new way for accident and inspiration to come together.\nHappy accident in 1939, then: the thick emulsion burns through, and the Sun, which should be bright, is dark instead, a vanished point. The effect is called solarisation. Elsewhere in California at the time Robert Oppeneimer is exploring the physics of the black hole; soon he will be working on the sun-bright bombs. As Adams develops the picture, the black sun’s light comes silver off the stream, flares white in the lens, casts the bare tree into shadow as if burnt.\nphotograph: courtesy of penelope umbrico\n541,795 Suns from Sunsets from Flickr (Partial) 01/23/06, 2006 (Detail, 2000 - 4 x 6” machine c-prints). By Penelope Umbrico (courtesy of the artist)\nEvery phone becomes a camera; every camera turns to the softened, sinking sun. Penelope Umbrico looks at Flickr, a then-newish photo-sharing app, and finds that “sunset” is the most common tag. In January 2006 she downloads 541,795 images; by 2019 she has 43,186,046. She selects, she centres, she crops, she prints. From time to time a subset will be installed somewhere, all the same, all different, a work of art unknown, for the most part, to the phone-wielders who made it possible. The endlessly repeated Sun slips from the focus; the creators’ shared, anonymised delight in the Sun becomes the subject in and of itself, an array of a thousand pinholes through which the light comes in.\nphotograph: akg\nThe Weather Project. By Olafur Eliasson; 2013; Installation in Tate Modern, London\nIt was, in fact, only half a Sun, an electric lower hemisphere reflected into wholeness by a mirrored ceiling that contrived to make the Tate’s cavernous turbine hall yet bigger. Where ancient sunlight stored in oil was once released and turned back into power a new source of sort-of sunlight sat low and unchanging. David Nye, a historian, introduced the idea of the “technological sublime”; recapturing nature in a quondam power station in 2013 Mr Eliasson made it his own. It felt as if it should be ominous: an ersatz Sun without a sky. But the gallery-goers loved it. They sat in front of it as if at the beach. They lay on their backs and looked at their rufous reflections above, making sun angels as they would snow angels. It was their sun, they said, theirs to enjoy.\nAlso try:\nThis week we published an essay and a leader on the way in which sunlight, as captured by photovoltaic cells, is changing the world. Earlier this year we wrote about the continuing relevance of Impressionism, the movement that took its name from Monet’s image of sunrise at Le Havre 150 years ago. In 2019 we wrote in appreciation of some of Mr Eliasson’s other works, and in 2020 a retrospective piece on Land Art discussed the work of Nancy Holt, her husband Robert Smithson, and others. Our obituaries editor has a lot more to say about Ravilious, the Sun, Sussex, souls and more in her book “Six Facets of Light”.

        "body": "F\nor six kilometres the road is a dusty moonscape without a hint of civilian life. The Netzarim corridor, as Israel calls it, slices across Gaza’s narrow waist, from its border with Israel to its Mediterranean coast. The buildings on both sides have been pancaked into piles of rubble. As a convoy bounces along the rutted track there are no Palestinians in sight, only Israeli soldiers and army vehicles and a constant swirl of grit. And then there is a dazzle of blue: the corridor ends at the sea, and the hulking steel pier that America spent $230m to install on Gaza’s shore.\nIn March, when Joe Biden announced the pier, he made it sound straightforward. Gaza had a problem with hunger. America had a whizzy solution; a modular floating causeway that its army would schlep halfway around the world and assemble in the Mediterranean. It would, the president said, allow for a “massive increase” in aid.\nListen to our podcast about Gaza’s aid pier\nThe reality was more complicated. The pier was finished on May 16th but was soon damaged by rough seas. It was operational for just two of its first six weeks.\nWhen The Economist visited the pier on June 25th, the first journalists to see it from inside Gaza, it was working again: two landing craft unloaded their cargo in just over an hour. Lorries drove off the vessels and down a causeway made of interlocking steel segments. They delivered pallets to a staging area, an expanse of beach flattened by the Israeli army and surrounded by berms and concrete barriers.\nThe Pentagon says the pier has delivered over 6,200 metric tonnes of aid this way since it was first installed, equal to 25 to 30 lorries a day—not trivial, but far short of the 150 a day that America promised.\nStill, the pier is just one piece of a larger aid operation. Supplies are also entering through Kerem Shalom, the main commercial crossing in the south, and via three land crossings in the north. “We’re trying to create different places of entry in order to have less friction,” says Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israeli army.\nThis spring, briefly, aid workers said things were improving. In March the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (ipc), a un-backed initiative that measures hunger, said that hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza would face famine within two months. But its latest study, published on June 25th, found that famine had been avoided, albeit temporarily, by a big increase in aid deliveries from March.\nThe good news ends there. The ipc said that 495,000 Gazans (almost 25% of the population) still face “catastrophic” levels of hunger. More than half of Gazans have sold their clothes to buy food; one in five go entire days and nights without eating.\nThe staging areas next to the American-built pier have two sets of gates. Lorries coming from the pier use the gates on the west side, next to the sea, to deposit their cargo. The eastern gates are for Palestinian drivers arriving to pick up aid. But the Israeli army says no one has come through those gates for two weeks, and that 7,000 pallets of aid (mostly food) have piled up in the staging areas. Your correspondents saw long rows of them, most bearing the logo of the World Food Programme (wfp). Aid is getting into Gaza—but no one is distributing it.\nIsrael blames Hamas for the delays. The group has repeatedly attacked the pier and Kerem Shalom, periodically halting aid deliveries from there. “The distribution problem is something hard to manage,” says Mr Hagari. “The international community has to make more of an effort.”\nAid workers say much the same about Israel. On June 25th the un warned that it would suspend its operations in Gaza unless the Israeli army co-ordinates more with them. Sending a convoy to pick up supplies involves many delays, often in areas with spotty communication and nearby fighting. “We’re going to ask for the green light to move that empty truck to a waypoint, and then wait for the green light to move to another waypoint,” says Matthew Hollingworth of the wfp. “Your 12-hour days have one hour of action.”\nMany Palestinians are sceptical of the pier. On June 8th Israeli troops freed four hostages being held by Hamas a few kilometres away. A video filmed by an Israeli soldier showed them being brought to a helicopter near the pier and then evacuated from Gaza. It has fuelled conspiracy theories that America built the pier for military purposes rather than aid deliveries.\nAt Kerem Shalom, where aid has been piling up for weeks, Mr Hollingworth likens the stretch of highway leading away from the crossing to something out of a Mad Max film: “Any truck that goes is going to lose its wing mirrors, people will try to smash the windscreen, people will try to get in.” Much of the violence is the work of criminal gangs using aid lorries to smuggle cigarettes (which now cost up to $25 each) into the enclave. Neither the Israeli army nor Hamas provide security on the road.\nThe un insists that only a lasting truce will solve the humanitarian crisis. That does not look imminent. On June 23rd Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said he was willing to make a “partial deal” to release some of the hostages in Gaza. “But we are obligated to continue the war after a pause,” he added in an interview with a right-wing Israeli network.\nHis comments sparked anger in Israel, because he seemed to be abandoning many of the hostages. They also upset officials in Washington because in May Mr Biden endorsed a proposal that could end the war for good. A day later Mr Netanyahu seemed to backtrack, saying he was still “committed” to Mr Biden’s suggested deal.\nThe back-and-forth was typical of a prime minister who has long wavered on whether to make a hostage deal, as most Israelis want, or continue the war, as his right-wing supporters demand. Hamas, for its part, wants firmer guarantees that the deal will end the war permanently. Like his plan for the pier, Mr Biden’s efforts at diplomacy are crashing into a hard reality. ■",

        "body": "M\npox is a viral infection typically found in parts of Africa and spread through contact with infected animals as well as within households. It causes severe fever, flu-like symptoms and a rash of pus-filled blisters across the body. In 2022 the disease, formerly known as monkeypox, spread around the world—cases turned up everywhere from Nigeria to America and Australia. A newly discovered strain of the virus, described by some researchers as the most dangerous yet, now threatens to spread beyond the Democratic Republic of Congo into neighbouring countries such as Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.\nAlthough much remains unknown about this strain, Jean Claude Udahemuka, a lecturer at the University of Rwanda who has been studying the outbreak, reports fatality rates of approximately 5% in adults and 10% in children. The virus exhibits different transmission patterns and disproportionately affects children. On June 25th the World Health Organisation emphasised the urgent need to deal with the surge of mpox cases in Africa.\nThe mpox outbreak in 2022 was caused by a different, and less severe form of the virus of the type “clade II”. The new strain was first identified in April in Kamituga, a gold-mining town in Congo’s South Kivu province. Researchers discovered it was a new lineage of the virus, distinct from previously known mpox strains, which they called “clade Ib”. The clade Ib strain has reportedly mutated to become more efficient at human-to-human transmission. This is causing concern about its potential for broader spread. Mpox has been circulating in humans for many years but it also exists in wild animals in several African countries and occasionally jumps to humans, for example through the consumption of bushmeat.\nUnlike the mpox outbreak in 2022, which was driven by male-to-male sexual contact, the new strain is spreading through heterosexual contact, particularly among sex workers, who account for about 30% of recorded cases. Researchers estimate that the outbreak began around mid-September 2023. As of May 26th, 7,851 mpox cases and 384 deaths have been reported in Congo (though it is unclear how many are clade Ib infections, as there is likely to be more than one outbreak in the country).\nIn Congo the new strain is behaving quite differently from other strains of mpox, with cases also suggesting transmission through close (non-sexual) contact. Dr Udahemuka reports instances of household transmission as well as an outbreak in a school. It is also just as common in women as in men, and is reported to be causing miscarriages. The risk of international spread appears to be high, with the strain detected in towns near national borders. The new strain has also been found in sex workers from Rwanda and Uganda, a group that is normally quite mobile. With the arrival of the dry season facilitating greater migration, experts fear it is only a matter of time before the virus starts to emerge in neighbouring countries and then spreads worldwide through close contact at international airports.\nIn April the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention called for an increase in surveillance and contact-tracing efforts. Some experts suggest it would be worth deploying the smallpox vaccine among high-risk groups such as sex workers and health-care workers, as it has been known in the past to offer cross-protection against mpox, which is a related virus. However, the effectiveness of the smallpox vaccine against this new strain remains unknown. Trudie Lang, a professor of global-health research at the University of Oxford, suggests that although there are uncertainties, the vaccine is safe, easy to use and worth trying. There are also trials under way of an antiviral drug known as tecovirimat, with results expected next year.\nThe situation in the region is complicated by war, displacement and food insecurity. Containment efforts are made harder still by the likelihood of asymptomatic cases, where individuals do not know they are infected but can nevertheless spread the virus to others. Dr Lang emphasises that this, along with the number of mild cases of the infection, are the biggest unknowns in the current outbreak. Preventing this new mpox strain from becoming another global health crisis requires swift and co-ordinated action. ■",

        "body": "A\ns anyone who has feuded with a neighbour knows, dumping rubbish over the hedge is a serious escalation. So imagine South Korea’s anger at the North, which has sent some 2,000 balloons, each carrying around 10kg of detritus, across the border since May 28th. The most recent bouquet, numbering around 350, started arriving on June 24th. According to the South, the bags contained paper, old clothing and parasites that probably originated in human faeces. Why is North Korea sending its rubbish south?\nAccording to Kim Yo Jong, the North’s chief propagandist and sister of Kim Jong Un, its dictator, it is responding to balloons sent northwards. She has warned that the “goblins of liberal democracy” in South Korea will receive many more balloons in return for those they send towards the North.\nSouth Korea does indeed have a history of floating balloons across the border. Its government once used them to send propaganda—including pictures of scantily clad women encouraging North Koreans to defect—but stopped in the early 2000s. Activists then stepped into the breach, launching balloons carrying leaflets and usb sticks loaded with pop music. The North’s latest barrage started after balloons from the South delivered 300,000 flyers that criticised the northern regime’s reversal of a decades-old policy of pursuing peaceful unification.\nMr Kim fears that information from the outside world will influence his people, which is why balloons carrying both agitprop and k-pop so worry his regime. Although the results of the South’s balloon campaign are hard to discern, information warfare has been effective on the peninsula. Many of the balloon-launching activists in the South escaped from the North themselves, and lots of them say that encounters with South Korean culture helped convince them to defect. The members of bts, South Korea’s most popular boy band, no doubt did more to project South Korean power by appearing on activists’ usb sticks than by serving in the armed forces.\nThat private citizens send these parcels does not matter to the Kims. In their view, the South Korean government’s failure to stop its citizens from sending propaganda bearing balloons is just as bad as ordering them to do it. And Ms Kim has reason to believe that expressing displeasure will work. When she complained about activists sending balloons in 2020, Moon Jae-in, then South Korea’s president and a believer in rapprochement, banned them. But attempts to crack down on activists did not stop the balloons, and the ban was deemed unconstitutional in 2023. A hawkish government is now in office; it insists it has no right to interfere with balloon launches.\nThese exchanges are risky. In 2014 the North shot at balloons with artillery. In 2017 the South did the same with machineguns. Some of the rubbish from the North’s most recent bunch landed not far from the office of Yoon Suk Yeol, the South’s president, in Seoul. He often promises to meet provocation with retaliation much graver than the initial blow. North Korea makes similar threats. Other events have put the two countries on guard. They include Mr Kim’s recent meeting with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, and warning shots fired by soldiers from the South at North Korean soldiers doing construction work in the demilitarised zone (dmz) separating the two countries.\nBut balloons are unlikely to start a war. Like the loudspeakers through which both sides blare propaganda across the dmz—recently restarted by the South in response to the North’s rubbish storm—they come into play when relations are strained. When tensions ease, South Korea’s government tends to try to clamp down on them. The balloons are a weather vane for inter-Korean relations: they show which way the wind blows. ■",

        "body": "W\nhen an unwanted house guest finally departs, the relief is palpable. So it is with the news that Julian Assange has left Britain. On June 24th the founder of WikiLeaks, a website that publishes classified and sensitive information, walked out of Belmarsh, a high-security prison in south-east London where he has spent the past five years, and hopped on a plane to Thailand. From there he flew to the Northern Mariana Islands, an American territory in the Pacific, where he pleaded guilty to one charge of violating America’s espionage laws. That fulfilled his side of a deal with the American government, which in return allowed him to go home to Australia. On June 26th he landed in Canberra, a free man.\nThis appears to mark the end of a long and unedifying legal drama. Mr Assange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 after Sweden said it wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations (these were later dropped, and he denied them). He claimed asylum in Ecuador’s embassy in London, where he lived for seven years. After Ecuador ran out of patience with him (at one point it claimed that he had smeared faeces on the embassy wall), British police removed Mr Assange and arrested him again.\nHe was soon being pursued by America’s Department of Justice (doj), which wanted him to face charges that he had conspired to hack government computers. In 2010, four years after Mr Assange founded WikiLeaks, the website released hundreds of thousands of classified American military documents, including diplomatic cables and battlefield reports, from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It was the largest such intelligence breach in American military history. Many of these documents are thought to have contained sensitive information which, the State Department said, endangered many innocent people.\nMr Assange has been fighting attempts to extradite him to America for years. During this long judicial battle he has polarised opinion. His supporters, who include many celebrities, paint him as a heroic whistleblower. The leaks published in 2010 do include documentation of a travesty: an American Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq in 2007 and killing a dozen civilians. They also appear to reveal larger estimates of civilian casualties in Afghanistan than had been reported.\nThose who would have liked him to stand trial in America regard him as a reckless criminal. If he exposed injustices by publishing unredacted copies of government documents, he also put honourable people at risk. Amnesty International and several other human-rights groups, which are not usually slow to criticise governments, expressed fears that the leaks about Afghanistan could be used to identify and imperil Afghans who had supported America. His lack of judgment was also on display in 2016, when WikiLeaks spread conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the American presidential nomination, and asked Russia for stolen emails about her.\nBut the central issue is that Mr Assange was accused of breaking the law. His supporters often cite his First Amendment rights, comparing him to a truth-telling journalist. But journalists do not have the right to hack computers; on that ground, America was justified in asking Britain to extradite him.\nShowing him some compassion now is also no bad thing. The doj had originally charged him on 18 counts, mostly under the Espionage Act. Its part of the plea deal was to drop 17 of them; and because Mr Assange had already spent several years in Belmarsh, American prosecutors did not try to imprison him for the charge to which he pleaded guilty. Mr Assange is not a hero, and does not deserve to be venerated as a martyr. A plea deal is a suitable ending to a grubby saga. ■\nEditor’s note (June 26th): This piece has been updated\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

        "body": "I\nn the cartoon “SpongeBob SquarePants”, Mr Krabs, purveyor of krabby patty hamburgers, is a frequent and ruthless price-gouger. He can get away with it since he has no competition, save for the unappetising Chum Bucket. McDonald’s, a fast-food chain that flips real-world hamburgers, can only dream of Mr Krabs’s pricing power. It has been forced into a fast-food price war.\nSince June 25th Americans hungry for a deal have been able to get a sandwich, fries, chicken nuggets and soft drink under the golden arches for just $5. Burger King, a rival fast-food chain, is matching the offer with a $5 meal deal of its own. The two are following in the footsteps of Wendy’s, which is temporarily adding an ice cream to its long-standing Biggie Bag combo. Starbucks, seemingly determined to protect its reputation for high mark-ups, is pricing a sandwich and a coffee at $6. McDonald’s calls this the “summer of value”; economists call it deflation. However labelled, the development is heartening for both consumers and Federal Reserve officials, who hope to reduce interest rates before the year is out.\nThe food fight is a return to normality for an industry defined by high volumes and low margins. To make a buck, fast-food chains need to attract vast numbers of value-conscious, typically low-income diners. McDonald’s, fearing that Burger King and Wendy’s were eating its lunch, introduced a Dollar Menu in 2002. Yet in recent years rising incomes and surging inflation have given fast-food joints a reason to supersize prices. The cost of a McDonald’s meal has risen by 40% since 2019, compared with a 19% rise in consumer prices more broadly. This boosted the firm’s operating profits until March, when they came in under expectations.\nMcDonald’s puts the disappointing results down to consumers becoming “more discriminating with every dollar”. American households spend almost all of what they earn and have made their way through savings built up during the covid-19 pandemic. In the face of slowing disposable-income growth and a robust-but-cooling jobs market, consumers are pulling back and now plan to dine out less often. Takeaway meals have been in part responsible for keeping inflation above the Fed’s 2% target, with prices growing by 4% in the year to June, compared with 1% for groceries. But that may be about to change. Although McDonald’s plans for its value offer to last for about a month, the economics of the fast-food industry have shifted. Lower prices look to be on the menu for good. ■",

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\nYour browser does not support the <audio> element.\nEditor’s note (June 20th 2024): The Supreme Court has ruled in Moore v United States, upholding the tax at issue (the “mandatory repatriation tax”). The court declined to weigh in on the constitutionality of a tax on unrealised gains.\nW\nhat is income, really? Ask an economist and they might describe “Haig-Simons” income—the value of a person’s consumption of goods and services, plus the change in their net worth over a certain period. A lawyer might refer to Section 61(a) of the irs Code 26, which defines “gross” income as “all income from whatever source derived”, including but not limited to commission, interest, property deals and wages. An accountant might talk about how to reduce that gross income, via deductions or carve-outs, to a skinnier “taxable income base”.\nThe answer matters. Whether governments should levy taxes on unrealised capital gains, as well as realised ones, is a topic of hot debate. In March, during the State of the Union address, Joe Biden reiterated his commitment to imposing a “billionaire minimum income tax” if re-elected. This would include a 25% tax on unrealised capital gains for Americans with more than $100m in assets, which he expects would raise $500bn (2% of gdp) over a decade. The Supreme Court is also considering the question. Its justices are poised to issue an opinion in Moore v the United States, a case in which the plaintiffs are arguing that a one-off tax on gains from an overseas investment was unconstitutional, since the 16th amendment, which enshrines in America’s constitution the federal government’s right to impose income taxes, does not apply to unrealised income.\nA large portion of ultra-rich Americans’ wealth is in unrealised gains. Since the release of the “Secret irs Files” by ProPublica, an investigative-journalism outfit, in 2021, a strategy known as “buy, borrow, die” has come under particular scrutiny. It allows those who employ it to avoid income and capital-gains taxes altogether.\nSay you own a successful business—so successful that your stake in it is worth $1bn. How should you fund your spending? If you pay yourself a wage of $20m a year, the federal government will collect 37%, or some $7.4m. So perhaps you should take a salary of $1 and sell $20m-worth of shares. If these were gifted to you upon founding the firm, the entire sum represents capital gains and will be taxed at 20%, which would mean a $4m hit. What if, instead, you called up your wealth manager and agreed to put up $100m-worth of equity as collateral for a $20m loan. In 2021 the interest rate on the loan might have been just 2% a year, meaning that returns from holding the equity, rather than selling it, would easily have covered the cost of servicing the borrowing. Because the proceeds of loans, which must be eventually repaid, are not considered income, doing so would have incurred no tax liability at all.\nThe strategy is even more compelling once the “stepped-up basis” is considered. When the holder of an asset dies, the value for capital-gains assessments is “stepped up” from its purchase cost to its value at the time of death. In this way, “buy, borrow, die” does not simply defer capital-gains taxes—it can eliminate them entirely. Nothing is paid on gains made between the original purchase of an asset and the value at the death of the original holder.\nTaxman confounded\nLow interest rates and booming stockmarkets make a “buy, borrow, die” strategy particularly attractive. At Morgan Stanley and Bank of America (boa), both of which run large wealth-management businesses, the total value of securities-backed loans to clients leapt from around $80bn in 2018 to almost $150bn in 2022. Banks are more than happy to make such loans. As lending tends to be collateralised by securities that can be easily seized and sold, it is treated as low-risk by regulators.\nDuring the past few years of high interest rates, however, borrowing against assets has become a riskier proposition. At Morgan Stanley such loans are structured as revolving lines of credit; three-quarters of them appear to have floating interest rates. If borrowing adds up to, say, 50% of a portfolio at a lofty valuation then a rout in the market can leave debtors with nothing. In 2022, after the share price of Peloton collapsed, John Foley, founder of the exercise-bike firm, ended up scrambling to restructure his loans, selling a $55m house in the Hamptons just months after he had bought it. At boa and Morgan Stanley the value of loans secured in such a manner had crept down by the end of 2023.\nYet politics, rather than high interest rates, represents the biggest threat to the strategy. There are three arguments against Mr Biden’s proposal: that it is unfair, that it is unconstitutional and that it would be an administrative burden. The fairness argument rests on the idea that unrealised gains are, in many ways, unreal. After all, the value of assets could change the day after a tax is paid. This perhaps explains why a survey by academics at New York University in 2021 found 75% of Americans oppose such taxation.\nA clue as to whether the Supreme Court believes that wealth taxes are constitutional will arrive in the coming days, when justices opine on Moore. The plaintiffs were taxed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was passed in 2017 and imposed a mandatory repatriation tax on the earnings, since 1986, of foreign corporations in which American shareholders own at least 50% of the stock. The levy applies regardless of whether the earnings were distributed to shareholders.\nIf the justices side with the plaintiffs, they may stop the push for an unrealised-gains tax in its tracks. But they seem unlikely to do so. Sonia Sotomayor, speaking for the court’s liberals, has noted that the concept of “realisation” was “well established” when the relevant constitutional amendment was ratified in 1913. As such, the early-20th century lawmakers could have specified that unrealised assets were to be left alone had that been what they intended. On top of this, at least two conservative justices have suggested they will not weigh in on the constitutional point.\nAs for the idea that wealth taxes on private assets are unworkable, that is too simplistic. Versions of them are already widely used in America, undermining arguments that they are impossible to administer in the country. Levies on property at the local or state level in effect act as taxes on unrealised capital gains. Every single American state has property taxes, which range from 0.3% to 2.3% of the property value each year. In more than half of states, property values are reassessed annually. Mr Biden’s plan also seeks to minimise headaches. It includes measures to smooth volatility so that losses incurred in one year can be offset against gains in another.\nStill, the bureaucratic effort to levy a new countrywide tax, on a small pool of people, on every kind of asset they might hold, would be wince-inducing. Valuing assets such as bonds and stocks is relatively straightforward. But private assets, whether a Picasso or an investment in a startup, would be another matter entirely. Adam Michel of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, points out that it took 12 years for the irs and Michael Jackson’s estate to reach a court-mediated agreement on the value of the late pop star’s assets. “Going through such a process every year for all taxpayers with assets near some threshold is unworkable,” he argues. Several European countries that have tried to levy wealth taxes and ultimately abandoned the effort have described administrative costs as a reason why.\nThankfully for Mr Biden, there is a less radical alternative that would have much the same effect as going after unrealised assets. Eliminating the stepped-up basis, which Mr Biden also hopes to do, would remove lots of the incentive to buy, borrow and die. It would also probably avoid a serious legal challenge and be easier to administer. Such a move would raise a quarter of the sum the president expects his grander plan to fetch. Taxing capital gains at death would raise another hefty chunk. And closing a few additional loopholes would just about cover the rest. ■\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

Diners found an assistant from the Philippines running the till via video link.\nThe service is provided by Happy Cashier, which connects American firms with Filipino workers. Chi Zhang set up the business after his restaurant failed during the covid-19 pandemic. He says that overseas workers also answer phone calls and monitor security-camera footage—doing so at a fraction of the cost of locals.\nVirtual cashiers are a visible part of a much bigger trend: the rise of service exports from the developing world. Exports of goods are familiar. Factories churn out widgets, which are shipped to customers around the world. Yet improved international connectivity has made various kinds of outsourcing and digital commerce much easier. As a result, service exports have jumped by 60% over the past decade, reaching $7.9trn (7.5% of global gdp) in 2023. The market for physical merchandise is even bigger, at $24trn, but has grown far slower, remaining flat as a share of gdp.\nWhat does this mean for countries hoping to get rich? Speaking in 2005 Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister, observed that, “since the industrial revolution, no country has become a major economy without becoming an industrial power.” But since 2005, the world has changed. Manufacturing is now more capital-intensive, making it easier for China to retain its role as the world’s factory. In the past few years, Western countries have embraced industrial policy and protectionism in an attempt to boost domestic manufacturing. Policymakers in emerging markets are arguing about how best to respond.\nAt present, services are mostly exported by rich countries, where white-collar professionals often work across borders. Although China surpassed America as an exporter of goods in 2009, Uncle Sam still exports two-and-a-half times more services than his rival. Britain, which has fallen to 14th place in the global rankings when it comes to goods exports, remains the world’s second-largest services exporter.\nchart: the economist\nBut developing economies are starting to make a mark in the more advanced types of services that can be sold overseas. Many countries export audiovisual, computer and telecommunication services. In Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine these run to more than 3% of gdp. India is the best-performing Asian country in this category; its exports fall just short of 3% of gdp. In an economy of India’s size, that means a big industry. The country’s five largest it firms have a joint market capitalisation of nearly $350bn. It is also home to 1,600 global capability centres—technology and research centres for multinational firms—that employ 3m people. All told, India’s services exports account for nearly 5% of the world’s, up from 3% a decade ago.\nThe less techy category of “technical, trade-related and other business services”, which covers things such as accounting and human resources, is another area of growth. Estonia and the Philippines top the table here, with such exports accounting for over 5% of their gdp. Like India, the latter offers low labour costs, as well as a large English-speaking population. In many countries workers also take casual gigs online. These are hard to measure, but two-thirds of the freelancers on English-speaking platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr are based in emerging economies.\nThen there is tourism. Not every country can replicate Japan’s temples or Mexico’s beaches, but many are finding ways to entice visitors, such as with medical services. Dentistry, hip replacements and hair transplants are among the treatments on offer. Costa Rica, Croatia and Moldova export health services worth between 0.2% and 0.5% of their economic output. Armenia and Jordan manage 1% each. A few hours in Istanbul airport provides a display of the thriving industry, as men return home with their heads wrapped in plastic, fresh hair taking root underneath.\nIn the short term, it seems likely that service exports will keep growing. In 1992 Stan Shih, founder of Acer, a Taiwanese computer-maker, coined the term “smile curve” to describe how value added in the manufacturing process was rising faster in the first and third parts of making a product (design and distribution, respectively) than in the second stage (manufacturing). As manufacturing has become more competitive, the smile has deepened. Think of Apple, which designs and distributes iPhones, and collects the rents from its brand, but produces none of the tech itself. Its market capitalisation is more than $3trn, whereas Foxconn, which makes 70% of the firm’s iPhones, is worth just $99bn. Even more cheerful is the fact that the rise of remote work has made firms far more comfortable with outsourcing operations. After all, a remote employee is not that different from an outsourced one.\nBut will service exports raise living standards in the manner of manufacturing? As Dani Rodrik of Harvard University notes, industry has historically possessed advantages in three areas: it is more technologically intensive, produces internationally tradable goods and creates lots of jobs. Although services is closing the gap in the first two areas, manufacturing still offers more employment.\nStart with technological growth. A factory in a poor country brings man and machine together, placing an unskilled worker at the tech frontier. Then, as the tech improves, the worker becomes still more productive. Tradable services cannot absorb unskilled workers in this manner. Yet as the World Bank has observed, since the 1990s labour-productivity growth in emerging economies outside of East Asia has risen at roughly the same rate in services as manufacturing—and services productivity has grown faster in emerging economies than rich ones. Moreover, artificial intelligence may soon provide service workers with another lift. Two experiments have found that ai tools help the least skilled knowledge workers catch up with more skilled ones when writing marketing copy and providing customer service.\nServices are also closing the gap with manufacturing when it comes to tradability, albeit slowly. Before the internet, the ability to send products overseas was the main way in which goods differed from services. Trade allows exporters to reach much larger pools of demand and achieve economies of scale that would otherwise have been beyond them. Because goods trade has been stagnant as a share of global gdp since 2010, it has become more difficult for newcomers to compete. Services trade is booming, and thus more welcoming. But even at the growth rate of the past decade, it will take 15 years to reach half the value of trade in manufactured goods.\nJob creation is an even thornier issue. Marc Lautier of the University of Rennes has calculated that, despite automation, the number of manufacturing jobs in 160 countries for which he has data has remained stable since 1991, accounting for 14% or so of total employment. The problem is that it has become more difficult for governments to attract these jobs. Manufacturing is not moving away from East Asian powerhouses at the same pace as it moved to them in the late 20th century, in part because modern factories require more capital and skill to build. Our analysis of labour-market data from 51 mostly emerging markets finds that only five—China, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Turkey and Vietnam—have 18% or more of their population employed in manufacturing, compared with 16 in 1990.\nchart: the economist\nGrowth in services offers only modest consolation, since services do not tend to offer labour density. The World Bank notes that, since 1990, service jobs have risen from 40% to 50% of global employment, as workers left agriculture. But just 5-10% of emerging-market service jobs are in tradable, techy industries, compared with 15-20% in rich countries. India’s it industry may garner $250bn in annual exports, worth nearly 8% of the country’s gdp, which is on a par with manufactured exports. Yet it only employs 8m people from a working-age population of around 1bn.\nIn the longer run, ai might cause problems. Models are best at well-defined tasks that do not need in-person context. That makes business services vulnerable. A report by Capital Economics, a consultancy, argues that ai could lead to the “slow demise” of India’s services exports, cutting growth by 0.3-0.4 percentage points a year over the next decade. The spread of communication tech has facilitated services outsourcing. Fresh technological change could, in time, be its undoing.\nDespite the downsides of a services-oriented approach to development, especially when it comes to providing decent jobs in large numbers, developing economies simply have fewer choices today than they once did. Governments that want to boost growth will therefore have to focus on different things. Whereas they once had reason to ensure that workers could easily move from farms to factories, today they would be better off paying attention to human capital among future white-collar workers. Richard Baldwin of imd Business School says that large, well-functioning cities will take on greater importance, too, since services often depend on agglomeration. Getting services right, especially those which can be sold overseas, is now a crucial condition for growth. ■\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\nYour browser does not support the <audio> element.\nI\nf there is one thing politicians agree on these days, it is that manufacturing jobs are “good” jobs. Joe Biden is betting that huge subsidies for new factories will transform the outlook for America’s workers—and November’s election. His acting labour secretary recently embarked on a jolly-sounding “Good Jobs Summer Tour” to trumpet the president’s plans. Donald Trump, Mr Biden’s rival, is just as eager to get more wrenches into the hands of American workers, mostly by slapping tariffs on foreign goods. Politicians across the rich world believe that reversing the decades-long decline in manufacturing employment would leave workers better off.\nYour guest Bartleby is not convinced. He has, admittedly, never worked in a factory, and thus feels no nostalgia for hard hats and high-vis vests. Still, the idea that deindustrialisation has made work worse is hard to square with the fact that data on worker satisfaction have been steadily improving for years.\nThe argument that manufacturing jobs are better than other sorts has a long pedigree. Adam Smith believed that manufacturing was “productive”, unlike services such as banking, retail or hospitality. The factories of the Industrial Revolution transformed living standards in Europe and America in the 19th century. Yet they were also awful places for workers, managing to be both horribly dangerous and tremendously boring. Things did not get much better with the rise of mass-production in the early 20th century. Workers in Henry Ford’s carmaking plants, though relatively well paid, complained that work was stultifying. As one Ford worker noted, “If I keep putting on Nut Number 86 for about 86 more days, I will be Nut Number 86 in the Pontiac bughouse.”\nEven during the post-war period—paradise lost, in the eyes of many Western politicians—people were hardly thrilled about working in factories. In 1970 Fortune magazine coined the phrase the “blue-collar blues” to describe the alienation many manufacturing workers felt in an impersonal industrial system. One pundit noted that such a worker would be “easy prey for demagogues who appeal to his resentment and his desire for revenge”, which sounds familiar.\nManufacturing enthusiasts will no doubt counter that jobs in the sector are much better today. Workplace accidents occur a fraction as often as they once did. Most factories are air-conditioned. Robots do many of the heaviest and most repetitive tasks. And around a third of those who work in manufacturing never go near a rivet, performing white-collar roles such as design and engineering.\nAll that may be so, but compare workers of a similar education level and there is little evidence they would gain by moving from services to manufacturing. One paper by statisticians at America’s Bureau of Labour Statistics found that, across a variety of measures including pay, benefits, job security and safety, “many industries within services equal or exceed manufacturing.” This Bartleby’s analysis of British data similarly shows that job quality in the manufacturing sector is no better than average.\nFor decades economists observed that manufacturing workers enjoyed a wage premium over comparable workers in other industries. A recent paper published by the Federal Reserve, however, shows that this premium has “disappeared” in recent years. Those who point to the insecurity of gig jobs, such as delivering takeaway meals, would do well to remember that manufacturing jobs are often more cyclical than those in services. They are also more likely to be automated away. It is not immediately obvious that a job tending to an industrial robot is more satisfying than one operating an espresso machine at Starbucks, especially for workers who enjoy some human interaction.\nAccording to Mr Biden, “A job is about a lot more than a pay cheque. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect.” That is true. Yet dignity and respect should be available for workers wherever they are employed. If not, politicians should focus their attention on ensuring the right regulations are in place, instead of spending billions of dollars trying to recreate a past that was far less rosy than they imagine.\nCompanies, of course, have a role to play as well, with plenty of evidence demonstrating that bosses who treat their employees well reap the rewards. And workers themselves need to face the fact that nostalgia misleads. Yes, work can be a drag. But it is probably the best it has ever been.■\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

        "body": "E\nver since France returned to nato’s integrated military command structure in 2009, reversing Charles de Gaulle’s decision to quit it in 1966, it has been a broadly solid partner for America and the Atlantic alliance. Today the French contribute troops and fighter jets to alliance operations and air policing along the eastern flank with Russia; they also patrol the Black Sea with manned aircraft. As president, Emmanuel Macron has turned into one of the European Union’s most outspoken advocates for bringing Ukraine into nato. He promises a coalition of military instructors to train newly mobilised recruits inside Ukraine, and to send the country French Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets.\nWithin weeks, however, France’s conduct of foreign policy may enter an uncertain, and even turbulent, period that could call such commitments into question. This is because of Mr Macron’s unexpected decision to call a snap parliamentary election, to be held on June 30th and July 7th. An Ifop poll on June 24th confirmed the strong lead for Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (rn), on 36%, followed by the left-wing alliance, New Popular Front (nfp), on 29.5%. Mr Macron’s pro-European centrist grouping is stuck in third place, with 20%.\nRead more of our coverage of France’s elections:\nThe economic recklessness of both France’s hard left and hard right\nEmmanuel Macron faces heavy losses after a short campaign\nA hard-right 28-year-old could soon be France’s prime minister\nOur French election poll tracker\nThe French president could end up a diminished figure in diplomatic affairs, overshadowed by a Eurosceptic or nato-sceptic government, comprising parties with historical ties to Russia. On June 23rd a group of 170 (anonymous) French diplomats warned in Le Monde of the particular dangers of a hard-right victory: “Our adversaries will read the victory of the extreme right as a weakening of France and an invitation: to interference in our national politics, to aggression against Europe, including militarily.”\nOn the hard right, the election campaign has in fact moderated some of its formerly radical positions. Ms Le Pen has long ditched her most Eurosceptic proposals, such as pulling France out of the euro, or advocating Frexit. She now advocates a “different” Europe, which would be an “alliance of nations” in which countries control more of their affairs (and France gets a rebate). The rn leader has denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and her party has paid back a €9m campaign-finance loan it took from a Russian bank with links to the Kremlin.\nIn recent days Jordan Bardella, her 28-year-old protégé and nominee for the job of prime minister, has rowed back on other former diplomatic pledges, too. While Russia is at war with Ukraine, he says, his party would no longer advocate France’s exit from nato’s integrated military command. Speaking in Paris on June 24th Mr Bardella announced that he would respect the military budget for 2024-30. That will please the French armed forces.\nThe party’s underlying instincts, however, could still mark a distinct break. One reason is the party’s many Russia links. In a television documentary in 2022 Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, a former party Euro-mp, who says he negotiated the party’s bank loan, said: “The interest for the Russians was to find Western allies.” At times, party figures sound as if they are reading from a Moscow script. A group of them took part in the “monitoring” of Russian elections. At a parliamentary hearing in 2023 Ms Le Pen defended the referendum held in Crimea after Russia annexed the Ukrainian territory in 2014, and argued that “Russian paranoia” about nato on its borders should be “taken into account”.\nIndeed the rn is unapologetic about its hostility to Ukrainian membership of either nato or the eu, both of which Mr Macron supports. “We support Ukraine, that’s very clear,” says Laurent Jacobelli, an rn leader. But, he says, the party does not want to be drawn into an Article Five (mutual-defence) commitment: “We don’t want world war three.” Mr Bardella has also ruled out sending any troops to Ukraine, something Mr Macron has refused to exclude, or continuing to supply it with long-range missiles that can reach Russian soil.\nThe left-wing alliance is far more robust in its support for Ukraine, despite the historic ties to Russia of some of its member parties; indeed, this was a condition for the Socialists to sign up. Their electoral pact explicitly backs weapons deliveries to Ukraine, the seizing of Russian oligarchs’ assets, and making Vladimir Putin responsible before international courts. It ducks altogether, however, the question of France’s tie to nato, a source of internal division. In 2022, when running for president, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the former Trotskyist whose party dominates the alliance, called for France to leave nato, which he described as “a useless organisation”. The electoral programme of the left-wing alliance devotes a page to Gaza, but makes no mention of nato, America or even China.\nIndeed, the nfp’s most vocal cause is its support for Palestinians, hugely popular among the young and in particular in France’s multi-cultural banlieues. The alliance promises that France would recognise “immediately” the Palestinian state, and sanction Binyamin Netanyahu’s Israel. Mr Mélenchon’s party’s reluctance to call the attacks by Hamas on October 7th “terrorism” has caused much friction among the alliance’s constituent parties. Raphaël Glucksmann, a Socialist member, who was clear about the use of the label “terrorist”, has been branded “the Zionist candidate” by a member of Mr Mélenchon’s party.\nUp to a point, under France’s Fifth Republic constitution, such divergent positions might not matter. It is the president who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, presides over national-defence councils, and can deploy French forces abroad. The government is responsible for domestic affairs. Moreover, it may well be that neither the right nor the left secures a parliamentary majority in second-round voting. In which case legislative deadlock and political instability may preclude much foreign-policymaking by the government.\nYet, as François Heisbourg, of the Foundation for Strategic Research, points out, the division of labour is more blurred than many observers assume. A defence minister and finance minister who wanted to block financing for, say, further weapons deliveries to Ukraine, could make things difficult for Mr Macron. Were the rn to enter government, it could prove almost impossible for the president to push publicly for Ukraine’s membership of either nato or the eu. “The president’s constitutional powers over foreign policy are more limited than people assume,” says Mr Heisbourg. If French voters do return a majority government dominated by either extreme, the country could be in for a complicated tussle between the two executives. At best, this will cause confusion, for allies as well as the French. At worst, it will seriously enfeeble France’s diplomatic standing abroad and weaken nato itself. ■\nTo stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Café Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

That prospect has led to alarm in financial markets and to claim and counter-claim about each bloc’s economic policies and the damage that might result. The French will vote in two rounds on June 30th and July 7th, after President Emmanuel Macron unexpectedly called a parliamentary election, shocking even his closest allies and business. On Friday 21st he said he was “confident in French people, their intelligence, their strength”. But several new opinion polls published over the subsequent weekend show the hard right continues to be in the lead, with a left-wing coalition running second.\nRead more of our coverage of France’s elections:\nThe alarming foreign policies of France’s hard right and hard left\nEmmanuel Macron faces heavy losses after a short campaign\nA hard-right 28-year-old could soon be France’s prime minister\nOur French election poll tracker\nBoth blocs’ agendas are “dangerous for the economy”, according to Patrick Martin, the head of medef, a business federation. The hard left’s tax and spending splurge could lead to a “catastrophe”, according to Olivier Blanchard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while the hard-right’s programme “is like a Christmas tree, without logic or coherence”. Although neither bloc may gain a majority in parliament, France has high levels of public debt and a large deficit. As a result the public finances are more vulnerable than in the past to any divergence from centrist policies or political gridlock, while the national interest bill will swell if spiking risk-premiums become permanently embedded in financial markets.\nchart: the economist\nOn the hard right, Marine Le Pen’s total yearly net spending promises when she ran for president in 2022 amounted to a massive €102bn ($109bn), according to the Institut Montaigne, a liberal think-tank. This would be the equivalent of about 3.5% of gdp. Back then extravagant promises cost her little; she was never expected to win. Now that her party, National Rally (rn), is leading in the polls, the prospect of power and jitteriness of markets means it is trying to temper some of its pledges and postpone costly extravagances.\nJordan Bardella, Ms Le Pen’s 28-year-old protégé and her candidate to become the next prime minister, now says that only some of the party’s promises would be put in place right away. The main immediate fiscal change would be to lower the rate of vat on energy and motor-fuel bills from 20% to 5.5%. The Institut Montaigne calculates this would cost up to €13.6bn a year. Mr Bardella wants to conduct an “audit” of public finances, presumably to secure a pretext for delaying costly pledges. The timetable for other party promises is vague.\nThe rn wants to cut payroll taxes in order to encourage firms to raise low-level salaries by 10%, which would carry a yearly cost of €10.5bn, according to economists at Allianz, an insurer. Mr Bardella promises to strike down Mr Macron’s pension reform, which raised the legal minimum retirement age from 62 years to 64; but now says that this would be “progressive”. He pledges that those who started work at 20 can retire at 60, which Allianz estimates would cost €17bn a year, including a promised hike in the minimum pension.\nSet against this, Mr Bardella resorts to the familiar claim that money could be saved by curbing fraud, improving efficiency and closing tax loopholes. Social-security bills, he says, would be reduced by tightening up on immigration. Setting France up for a full-frontal potential clash with the European Union, he also claims that he would negotiate a €2bn-3bn cut in the country’s contribution to the eu budget (€21.6bn this year) and pull France out of the eu’s electricity-sharing arrangement, which it says limits France’s ability to pass on the benefits of producing relatively cheap nuclear power to consumers. The rn also wants to restore the wealth tax, which used to apply yearly on all assets worth over €1.3m; Mr Macron replaced it with a form of “mansion tax” that applies only to property over that value.\nAllianz estimates the rn’s total yearly spending pledges, excluding a plan to nationalise motorways, would amount to €74bn, with a net yearly cost of €18bn, excluding the reversal of the pension reform. Even factoring in extra tax revenues and savings, Allianz calculates that the rn’s plans would push the annual deficit up to 6.4% of gdp by 2026.\nA swerve left\nThe left-wing alliance, dominated by Unsubmissive France, the party of Jean-Luc Mélenchon (pictured), a one-time Trotskyist, has even more ambitious tax-and-spending plans. Known as the New Popular Front (nfp), this movement wants to raise the minimum wage by 14%, which the Institut Montaigne estimates would cost €3.5bn a year. Its pledge to cap energy prices and those of other “essential items”, such as basic food, would cost a further €24bn a year, says the institute. Other measures include striking down Mr Macron’s pension reform, reintroducing the wealth tax, bringing in an “exit tax” for those leaving the country, scrapping France’s 30% flat tax on financial income, increasing inheritance tax and imposing a tax on “super profits”, whatever they mean by those. “For a lot of companies it’s going to be a shock,” said Eric Coquerel, from Mr Mélenchon’s party.\nOn June 21st the alliance, which is advised by a coterie of left-wing economists, among them Thomas Piketty, laid out its plans. It says the total new annual spending would come to €25bn in 2024, €100bn in 2025 and €150bn by 2027, and claims that this expenditure would be covered by extra revenues, notably from extra taxation, mostly on high-earners, financial assets and firms. Among the measures the nfp would introduce is a new wealth tax, which it says would raise €15bn, with a further €15bn from taxing “super profits”. It will also raise public-sector pay and housing benefit, and make all state-school meals and supplies free to all. The bill, it says, is nothing next to the “€100bn of money paid out to shareholders by the top 40 quoted companies in 2023”.\nThe left-wing alliance argues that it is putting forward a stimulus package that will help relaunch the French economy, and put an end to what it calls “a policy of austerity” under Mr Macron. Valérie Rabault, a Socialist member of the alliance, heroically projects gdp growth of at least 3% in 2025 and 2026—roughly double the forecasts of the Bank of France. Her forecasts for the budget deficit do not see a return to below 3% of gdp, as required by euro-zone rules, over the next five years. Mr Blanchard argues the result would be an exodus of entrepreneurs, and that the increase in the minimum wage would make employment costs unsustainable for many businesses and prompt redundancies.\nWalk on the wild side\nThe optimistic view of all this is that French politicians often make wild economic promises but they are rarely enacted. Neither the hard left nor hard right may win an outright majority in parliament, which would mean political gridlock or coalition negotiations rather than unconstrained radicalism. Whoever makes up the next government will also be disciplined by the financial markets, this argument goes. Mr Bardella’s back-pedalling hints that the rn has realised this, and is beginning to manage voters’ expectations as well as to try to calm the markets. As it comes under scrutiny the left-wing alliance may need to do the same, although its fiery anti-capitalist rhetoric suggests it will find this hard.\nA more pessimistic view is that France is vulnerable, more so than in the past. Its ratio of public debt to gdp has risen from 66% two decades ago to 112% now, and it is running a fiscal deficit of over 5% of gdp. In order to stabilise and reduce its debt load it needs pragmatic economic policies. New projections from Goldman Sachs, a bank, show debt to gdp rising slightly further under the status quo or a parliamentary deadlock. In the event of a hard-left or hard-right government it could jump to as high as 120% of gdp by 2027.\nOn June 21st yields on France’s ten-year bonds were 0.8 percentage points higher than for German ones, the biggest gap since 2012 and a rise of about 0.3 percentage points since Mr Macron called the election. If sustained these higher yields will eventually mean higher interest bills, adding to the fiscal strain. The political outcome of Mr Macron’s snap election remains highly uncertain, but economically it may come to be seen as marking the end of the centrist agenda of the past decade and the start of a more turbulent era. ■\nTo stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Café Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

Today the 28-year-old leader of the hard-right National Rally may be weeks away from becoming prime minister of France, and its youngest ever by a long way. After a two-round legislative election on June 30th and July 7th, his party could win enough seats to form a government. The ascent of Marine Le Pen’s young protégé from obscurity to the cusp of high office is one of the more improbable in modern French politics.\nThe son of an Italian-born mother and a father whose family arrived in France from Italy, Mr Bardella grew up in social housing in Seine-Saint-Denis, a multicultural northern banlieue (suburb) of Paris. What could have held him back in life became his political selling-point. “I have my roots there, a part of myself and my family’s history,” Mr Bardella told Le Monde, recalling the drug dealers that hung out on a battered sofa on the landing outside his flat. “I’m in politics for everything that I lived through back there.”\nRead more of our coverage of France’s elections:\nThe economic recklessness of both France’s hard left and hard right\nThe alarming foreign policies of France’s hard right and hard left\nEmmanuel Macron faces heavy losses after a short campaign\nOur French election poll tracker\nThis backstory, as well as his unusual poise, grabbed Ms Le Pen’s eye early on. Both assets were politically valuable for a party that, under her stewardship since 2011, has been trying to transform itself from a fringe xenophobic protest outfit into a party that speaks for the people and promises to govern on their behalf. At the age of 16, Mr Bardella joined the party because of Ms Le Pen’s takeover. Seven years later—after he had dropped out of a geography degree at the Sorbonne university and gone into local politics—she picked him to lead her party into elections in 2019 to the European Parliament. A year earlier, she had changed its name from the tainted National Front she inherited from her antisemitic, xenophobic father to the National Rally (rn), a name with more mainstream associations.\nNot everyone within the party was happy with Mr Bardella’s hasty rise. Rivals considered him too young, inexperienced and disconnected from core party loyalists. Mr Bardella’s formal consecration came in 2022, when he beat Ms Le Pen’s former romantic partner, Louis Aliot, to be elected president of the rn. That freed Ms Le Pen from daily party affairs (she remains head of its bloc in parliament, and will undoubtedly be its nominee for the next presidential race, in 2027). Since then, Mr Bardella has earned respect among a generation of younger rn figures. “He has an impressive work ethic and maturity,” says Jean-Philippe Tanguy, an outgoing rn deputy, adding that Mr Bardella’s asset is that he is open to criticism but “ruthless with pointless whiners.”\nTo voters, Mr Bardella has lent the rn a presentable modern face and unflappable style. A child of the screen era, Mr Bardella has in the past posted clips on a YouTube channel in which he commentated on his video-game performances. Today he has 1.6m followers on TikTok, and mixes campaign clips with those of himself squeezing mayonnaise into a hotdog or climbing aboard a fishing trawler in the fog. “He looks like a nice guy” is a typical comment made by voters on the ground who have no ideological link to the rn.\nWhat lies behind that smooth exterior, though, remains something of a mystery. In his short career, Mr Bardella has never held a job outside politics. Fixated on the sanitisation of the party, he balks at any reference to Jean-Marie Le Pen’s antisemitic era, or the unsavoury figures who linger in party circles from that time. The young rn president owes his promotion to Ms Le Pen, and colleagues say that his loyalty to her is absolute. But politics is what it is; such fidelity has so far been untested. Differences between them do exist. The party formerly borrowed money from a Kremlin-linked bank, and deputies abstained at a parliamentary vote earlier this year on France’s bilateral security agreement with Ukraine. Mr Bardella, though, has recently sounded a somewhat more critical note about Vladimir Putin, blaming escalation on the Russian leader; Ms Le Pen tends to point the finger at President Emmanuel Macron, who has refused to rule out putting boots on the ground in Ukraine.\nIf he is nominated as prime minister, Mr Bardella’s manifesto will be a mix of economic populism and hard-right nationalism. He has promised “in the first weeks” to tighten immigration rules to make it easier to expel “Islamist foreigners”, and abolish the right to French nationality for those born in the country. He also vows “immediately” to lower the level of vat from 20% to 5.5% on electricity and gas bills as well as on motor fuel, and to use tax-breaks to raise salaries by up to 10%. Mr Bardella would cut benefits to parents of underage repeat offenders, and turn the current mansion tax into a financial-wealth tax. He has been more cautious, though, about promising to overturn Mr Macron’s pension reform, which raised the legal minimum retirement age from 62 years to 64; instead, he vows to enable those who started work at the age of 20 to retire at 60.\nHow such measures would be financed remains alarmingly vague. Renaissance, Mr Macron’s party, calculates that the vat cuts on energy, fuel and food bills alone would cost €24bn ($26bn) a year. The Institut Montaigne, a liberal think-tank, estimates that, on the basis of Ms Le Pen’s manifesto at the presidential election in 2022, the RN in government would cost a net €100bn extra each year, equivalent to about 3.5% of gdp. That would add to an already high budget deficit, which the government expects to run at over 5% of gdp this year.\nYet the trouble for centrist voters hoping to obstruct his path to the Matignon, as the French prime minister’s office in Paris is known, is that Mr Bardella has so far managed to shrug off inconvenient details or failings. That he grew up in Seine-Saint-Denis is widely known; less so, that he attended a private Catholic school there, not the public lycée.\nVoters seem no more bothered by his loose grasp of policy detail. During a recent live debate against Gabriel Attal, Mr Macron’s 35-year-old prime minister, Mr Bardella was forced to confess that he had not read the text of a bill in the European Parliament that he had voted against. A poll the next day, however, suggested that the debate had convinced more people to vote for Mr Bardella’s party than Mr Attal’s. If Mr Bardella represents anything in these populist times it is that reasoned argument and rational debate are flimsy weapons against the force of simplistic promises and narrative politics. ■\nTo stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Café Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

This was a preface to a montage of video clips showing “President Biden’s obvious and increasing infirmity”.\nOne, from a star-studded fund-raiser held in Los Angeles on June 15th, shows Mr Biden staring blankly at the audience before Barack Obama, the night’s other headline act, grasps his arm and leads him offstage. The second, taken a few days earlier at the g7 summit in Italy, appears to show Mr Biden wandering away from other world leaders as they watch a skydiving demonstration. In conservative corners of the media and the internet, such clips of Biden freezes abound. Another recent entry shows the president staring blankly at a White House concert celebrating the new federal holiday of Juneteenth on June 19th, which marks the end of slavery.\nStay up to date with our new daily update, The us in brief, and our presidential poll tracker.\nRead more of our coverage of the us elections of 2024.\nSelective editing of the clips makes them look more devastating than they are. A longer recording of the Los Angeles episode shows Mr Biden waving to one side of the audience and clapping before turning and standing still for about seven seconds—possibly to try to hear what was being shouted (Mr Obama intervened before anything more awkward could occur). A fuller clip of the Italian incident shows that Mr Biden did not wander off into the distance but rather to greet a skydiver who had landed off-screen (though Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, similarly intervened to bring him to centre stage).\nThis is not to say that the president is a paragon of lucidity. Mr Biden, an octogenarian, certainly has his senior moments. Some are hard to explain away: in 2022 he wondered whether a recently deceased congresswoman was in a crowd at a White House event (“Where’s Jackie?” he asked to silent horror). The special counsel appointed to investigate classified documents at Mr Biden’s house said that he frequently confused dates, including of his son’s death in 2015. The transcript of the interview is not exactly exonerating.\nThe fracas gives a preview for what the next five months of campaigning will look like. Donald Trump and his allies will relentlessly scrutinise the president’s public appearances for signs of senility and distribute clips purportedly showing this (there is little need for ai-generated disinformation when simple editing tools do so well). Mr Biden’s campaign will be anxious not to give them too much material to work with, reinforcing a bunker mentality.\nAllies of Mr Biden wonder why more is not made of Mr Trump’s strange utterances. On June 9th at a rally in Las Vegas, the former president told a bizarre, lengthy hypothetical story about being electrocuted by a battery-powered boat while being chased by sharks. It might be an enjoyable, absurdist scene in a b-horror film, were it not for the scarier fact that the raconteur is the leading contender to win the presidential election. Mr Trump, who is 78, has also confused the leader of Hungary for that of Turkey and mistakenly said that Mr Obama was now president.\nDemocrats are right about the difference in standards. Such utterances are barely news stories for Mr Trump; Democrats might forcibly commit Mr Biden to an elder-care facility for a monologue like that. Yet the difference in standards is the point. Mr Biden’s pitch is competent, rational leadership, whereas Mr Trump has been a surrealist from the start.\nVoters appear to be steeling themselves for a dismal choice. A recent poll conducted for cbs News by YouGov found that just 35% of registered voters say Mr Biden is mentally and cognitively healthy enough to be president; even 29% of registered Democrats say they are not sure their man is all there. The same poll found that 50% of voters thought Mr Trump was mentally fit for office. Only in this contest could such a result be thought of as positive.\nMr Trump is sure that he has the cognitive advantage. His campaign has pushed for holding multiple debates, on the theory that Mr Biden would not be able to keep up either rhetorically or physically. While president, Mr Trump memorably bragged about his high marks on a mental-acuity test (meant as a diagnostic tool for early dementia, not admission to MENSA). Speaking in Detroit this week, Mr Trump challenged Mr Biden to take the same test he had “aced”. While issuing the blustery challenge, Mr Trump got confused about the name of the White House physician who administered it to him: he was Ronny Jackson, not “Ronny Johnson”. ■",

        "body": "“W\ne ain’t dead yet,” Frank Fahrenkopf insisted last month on “The Daily Show”, an American tv programme. Jon Stewart, the host, looked sceptical. Mr Fahrenkopf leads the Commission on Presidential Debates (cpd), a non-partisan body whose sole purpose is to organise match-ups every four years. This year his group will have nothing to do with them. In May, after signalling that he might not participate at all, Joe Biden challenged Donald Trump to debate him—on Mr Biden’s terms. Mr Trump agreed. The presidential candidates will face off twice. Unusually, news networks, rather than the cpd, will host the encounters. They will take place months earlier than they normally would. The first is scheduled for June 27th. How will these new arrangements change presidential debates?\nThe cpd was founded in 1987 to “institutionalise” the debates and mediate between rival campaigns. At the time, televised showdowns were relatively new. The first, between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, took place in 1960. But candidates did not debate again for 16 years. Incumbents tended to consider the practice degrading.\nIn case you missed it\nWhy young men and women are drifting apart\nTen charts compare Joe Biden’s record with Donald Trump’s\nThe rise of the remote husband\nWhen debates restarted, in 1976, the League of Women Voters sponsored them. But the League lacked money—and power. In 1984, for example, it allowed the presidential campaigns to veto about 100 of the journalists that it had put forward to moderate an event. The two main parties created the cpd to have more clout: it is made up of both Democrats and Republicans and, with sponsorship from private companies and fees from the institutions that host debates (usually universities), has a permanent budget. According to Mr Fahrenkopf, the cpd did not, for example, agree to a request by Al Gore—the sweat-prone (and presciently temperature-focused) Democratic candidate in 2000—for the debate room to be set at 10°C.\nOver the years the cpd’s format became standardised: it put on three 90-minute debates, divided into six 15-minute segments, during each general-election year. Third-party candidates were eligible only if they appeared on enough ballots to win the electoral college and polled at 15% or higher.\nBut both Republicans and Democrats have complained about the cpd in recent years. The parties have wanted debates to be held earlier in the year, to account for a rise in early voting, which surged during the pandemic. Mr Trump’s campaign criticised the cpd for setting this year’s first debate for September 16th; ten states will have begun mailing out ballots by then. In truth, candidates have another reason to favour early debates: it gives them more time to recover from gaffes. Republicans also claimed that the commission was “biased” in its selection of moderators: one, chosen for a debate in 2020 that did not take place because Mr Trump had covid, had interned for Mr Biden decades before.\nThe conditions that Mr Biden proposed last month reveal his worries. In the first debate four years ago Mr Trump constantly interrupted both the moderator and Mr Biden. This month cnn, the host, will mute microphones when the candidates are not entitled to speak. There will be no studio audience, which will thwart Mr Trump’s impulse to whip up sympathetic crowds. cnn is adhering to the cpd’s standard for third-party candidates. If abc, the host of September’s debate, does too, then Robert Kennedy junior, who is on the ballot in six states so far and polling well, could plausibly qualify.\nThe cpd rejects the campaigns’ complaints over timing. It insists that its proposed date would affect only a small number of voters, while giving independent candidates enough time to secure a place on ballots. It also argues that the debates agreed to by Mr Biden and Mr Trump, which will only be disseminated by the host network, will reach a smaller audience. Still, Mr Fahrenkopf conceded that if the campaigns “can reach some agreement…and [the debate] happens”, that is good news. For now the Biden and Trump camps, divided on everything else, seem to have struck a deal. Whether future campaigns will do so is up for debate. ■",

        "body": "F\nor most people in Belgorod, a once quiet and comfortable Russian city 40km from the Ukrainian border, the war started on December 30th 2023, almost two years after it started in Ukraine. That day the centre of Belgorod was hit by a Ukrainian rocket, killing 25 civilians, including two children, and wounding more than a hundred. Since then the city and the province that surrounds it have been attacked almost daily. Some 200 civilians have died and 800 have been wounded. Small numbers compared with what Ukraine has endured; but far more than anywhere else in Russia.\nMikhail Ivankiv, a 22-year-old final-year student at Belgorod State University, had just finished shopping for New Year presents for his parents and his fiancée. That New Year was supposed to be the start of his new life, his father says. “He had found his first job, and was about to move in with his fiancée. They planned to celebrate New Year’s eve together and he said he would come and see us the next day.” He never did. A few days later Mikhail died in hospital, after losing both his legs.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\nMr Ivankiv senior, an ethnic Ukrainian, was born and bred in Soviet Kazakhstan, where his grandfather, a native of western Ukraine, was exiled after spending several years in Stalin’s gulag. He grew up a Soviet man, served in the Soviet army and lived in Pskov, in north-western Russia. In 2013 the family moved to Belgorod. They were attracted by its mild southern climate, its modern feel, its fertile agricultural land and its proximity to Ukraine, where many of their relatives lived.\nKharkiv and Belgorod, 80km apart and connected by a highway, were not just formally sister cities; they formed a common historic, cultural and linguistic space. Belgorod was settled by free Ukrainian peasants and Cossacks who fled Polish rule and Tatar raids. There was no distinction between the accents and dialects. It was a rare family in Belgorod that did not have relatives on the other side of the border.\nFor Belgorod, a city of 340,000 people, Kharkiv was a capital. A metropolis four times its size, “Kharkiv had a greater influence on us than Moscow or St Petersburg,” says Noize mc, a Russian rapper and singer, who was born and bred in Belgorod and gained fame in Kharkiv. Kharkiv had cooler bars and bigger shopping malls and cinemas. It had a McDonald’s that attracted schoolchildren from Belgorod, and the Barabashova open-air market, one of the largest in Europe, that drew traders and buyers from Russia and across the former Soviet Union. The border between Belgorod and Kharkiv was largely notional.\nmap: the economist\nIn 2014 that changed. That is when Russian forces first invaded Donbas and tried to incite strife in Kharkiv. The border between Belgorod and Kharkiv solidified and the fortunes of Barabashova turned sour. In 2022 Russian missiles hit the market, turning 15 hectares of stalls (nearly 20% of the whole) to rubble. But the war has also turned Belgorod into a front-line city.\nOver the past few months it has been hit by everything that flies, including rockets and kamikaze drones fired from Ukraine, debris that falls from the sky when Russian air defence intercepts them, and Russian glide-bombs destined for Kharkiv but frequently released prematurely by accident. That is what happened on May 4th when a 500-kilogram bomb damaged 30 houses and ten cars and wounded seven civilians, including a child.\nOnce popular for its new housing and good schools, Belgorod now excels in concrete shelters, online schooling and regular drills on how to resuscitate, bandage and tourniquet the wounded; once a champion of attracting migrants from across the country, it now has a record outflow of people. Some 26,000 houses have been damaged, and 9,000 children have been evacuated. Those who have stayed are studying remotely. Elena Koneva, founder of ExtremeScan Group, a sociology-research group, estimates that 150,000 people have relocated from the province.\nWhile many people are heading out of Belgorod, columns of military vehicles are heading in. According to the Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank in Washington, Russia has concentrated some 30,000 troops in the Belgorod region. Most of the time they remain invisible to civilians, but on June 1st a man in Belgorod died when a drunk tank driver rammed his car.\nVladimir Putin claims that the purpose of his stalled push into Kharkiv is to protect Belgorod from being shelled. If so, his bombs are having the opposite effect. And people in Belgorod know that when Russia bombs Kharkiv, they also suffer. “When we hear that Russia has launched a big attack, everybody anticipates an avenging strike,” says Timofey, a journalist and activist.\nUkrainian commanders in Kharkiv say attacks on Belgorod have a dual purpose. One is to take out military infrastructure. The other is to drive the war home to people in Russia. Although the former is a legitimate act of war, the latter smacks of retribution against civilians.\nBut if anything, being drawn into war has consolidated Belgorod. Nearly 70% of its people are volunteering: collecting money, joining territorial defence, staffing hospitals, says Ms Koneva. Her research shows that support for Mr Putin’s “special military operation” is 5-7% higher than in Russia as a whole; not because they wish death on their neighbours, but because they fear retribution from Ukraine. This fear breeds anxiety, a sense of despair, depression and alienation, rather than any real enthusiasm Ms Koneva says.\nDespite his loss, Mr Ivankiv feels no hatred towards Ukrainians on the other side of the border, not even its soldiers. “They are people like us and their soldiers are also someone’s brothers, husbands, fathers.” He blames the governments of both countries for the war and describes it not as an act of Russia’s aggression but as a tragic occurrence. Like many people across Russia he knows that what is happening is not right, but in talking about the war he invokes familiar propaganda tropes about Ukrainian nationalists, America’s meddling in Ukraine or nato’s threat to Russia; a psychological safety-blanket, perhaps, that helps him survive his grief.\nAs a dutiful citizen, says Mr Ivankiv, he never gave up on his country and he participates in elections, including the latest presidential one, in March. (He would not say whom he voted for, but that hardly matters since that election offered no choice.) Belgorod came under particularly heavy fire during the three days of voting; most people in Belgorod did not risk coming out. A reporter for Novaya Gazeta, one of the very few independent news outlets left in Russia, described empty polling stations. This did not stop Channel One, a flagship state propaganda channel, from reporting long queues of voters. Novaya Gazeta summed up the election result: “Turnout–87%, ten people dead, 68 wounded. Victory for Vladimir Putin.”\nFor many people, particularly the young ones who did not bother participating in the farce, that result was a clear sign of the disconnect between their reality and Kremlin politics. “Moscow just does not give a toss about Belgorod,” says Timofey. But just in case, the government has been throwing money and perks at Belgorod. On May 31st Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Situations awarded Belgorod the first prize in its all-Russian competition for “a city without dangers”. ■\nTo stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Café Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

        "body": "W\nhen vladimir putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, many Western observers thought it a temporary regional crisis that ultimately would settle into a frozen conflict.  Two and a half years later, this view is challenged by a more consequential reality.\nThe Russian leader’s goal is not just to break Ukraine and stop its quest for a place in the family of Western democracies, but to dismantle the American-led security system that emerged after the second world war. In that sense Mr Putin is fomenting a revolution: using the strategy and tactics of revolution against the Western system. His war against Ukraine is inextricably linked to the strategic objective of his revolution.\nIn the early 1990s Russia’s reformers judged that the country could be competitive only by integrating itself into the global economy and stepping away from confrontation with the West. The past 20 years of Mr Putin’s rule have been characterised by two very different, concurrent patterns: the stage-by-stage dismantling of democracy and freedoms inside Russia, and an intensifying campaign to delegitimise the West, its democratic values and the institutions that uphold them.\nInside Russia the results have been greater repression against the Russian people, greater power for the security services, greater wealth for Kremlin-connected business leaders and greater investment in the armed forces. Outside Russia Mr Putin has increasingly pressured the America-led global order; sought to undermine norms, principles, and rules of Western institutions; organised regional and global opposition to the West; and conducted military action in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria.\nMr Putin now asserts that the Western system poses an existential threat to the sovereignty of Russia and the values it should hold. He speaks of two sharply contrasting visions of the future: either the Western system continues to exist and Russia is strategically defeated, or the Western system is replaced and Russia continues to exist. He is convinced that Russia has reached a historical crossroads in its post-Soviet development and that dismantling the existing global order and building a new one is fundamental to Russia’s greater-power aspirations. His revolutionary push is motivated by both internal power-preservation aims and external power-expansion aims.\nHis revolution values Russian advantage and gain of power over the West more than coexistence, mutual security, crisis avoidance and stability with the West. His security vision requires a Europe without nato, and without organisations that uphold the fundamental principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. That vision also involves Russian co-operation with other countries to curb American power in the Arctic, Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions.\nHis “all of Russia” revolution and war are now shaping how Russia is organised, how society is mobilised, how industry is prioritised, how foreign policy is aligned, how the army is structured and how communications are conducted. His legitimacy as a leader of Russia—and his place in history—are now inextricably tied to this revolution. He portrays himself as the only leader who can guide Russia through this crossroads of history. Mr Putin’s pursuit of advantage and power is unlikely to be replaced by caution in pursuit of stability.\nNeither his revolution nor his war is near its end. In Ukraine he is pursuing several strategic actions simultaneously. By intensifying military operations and attacking Ukraine’s infrastructure he hopes to weaken its defence, demoralise its armed forces and create among the broader population a sense of inevitable Russian victory. He is also seeking to divide Ukraine politically. And he wants to damage the West’s will to continue supporting Ukraine in the war.\nThe signs are that Mr Putin will continue to pursue this revolution-and-war approach, further locking the country’s politics, economy and armed forces into a structure that can only sustain revolution and war. It is unlikely that he will stop the revolution, demobilise the armed forces, deconstruct the war economy or re-embrace acceptance of the Western system. It is equally unlikely that he will seek political, economic, conflict-resolution or arms agreements with Western countries. This revolution and war will put enormous stress on Russian society—a price that Mr Putin appears willing to pay.\nMr Putin has chosen decisive paths to advance Russian power. He is leading Russia into a new phase of strategic confrontation with the West over the America-led regional and global order. Given his logic, this reality is not a temporary crisis-management challenge. The West must continue to support Ukraine’s right to self-defence and strengthen the collective security and defence of the Euro-Atlantic area and globally, as part of a strategic pattern to manage Russia’s pressure and assault on a global security system. Absent these steps, Mr Putin would have the opportunity to match a level of aggression against the Western system with his level of revolutionary ambition.\nIn late 2022, Mr Putin predicted that ahead lay “probably the most dangerous, unpredictable and, at the same time, important decade since the end of World War II”—a state of affairs that he said was “fraught with global conflicts”. His destabilising, calculated revolution and war against Ukraine—Mr Putin’s choices for Russia—could make his prediction a reality. He is organising and preparing Russia for this future, not setting a course to avoid it. ■\nStephen R Covington is Strategic and International Affairs Adviser to NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (saceur).

        "body": "I\nn april a New York fried-chicken shop went viral. It was not the food at Sansan Chicken East Village that captured the world’s imagination, but the service. Diners found an assistant from the Philippines running the till via video link.\nThe service is provided by Happy Cashier, which connects American firms with Filipino workers. Chi Zhang set up the business after his restaurant failed during the covid-19 pandemic. He says that overseas workers also answer phone calls and monitor security-camera footage—doing so at a fraction of the cost of locals.\nVirtual cashiers are a visible part of a much bigger trend: the rise of service exports from the developing world. Exports of goods are familiar. Factories churn out widgets, which are shipped to customers around the world. Yet improved international connectivity has made various kinds of outsourcing and digital commerce much easier. As a result, service exports have jumped by 60% over the past decade, reaching $7.9trn (7.5% of global gdp) in 2023. The market for physical merchandise is even bigger, at $24trn, but has grown far slower, remaining flat as a share of gdp.\nWhat does this mean for countries hoping to get rich? Speaking in 2005 Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister, observed that, “since the industrial revolution, no country has become a major economy without becoming an industrial power.” But since 2005, the world has changed. Manufacturing is now more capital-intensive, making it easier for China to retain its role as the world’s factory. In the past few years, Western countries have embraced industrial policy and protectionism in an attempt to boost domestic manufacturing. Policymakers in emerging markets are arguing about how best to respond.\nAt present, services are mostly exported by rich countries, where white-collar professionals often work across borders. Although China surpassed America as an exporter of goods in 2009, Uncle Sam still exports two-and-a-half times more services than his rival. Britain, which has fallen to 14th place in the global rankings when it comes to goods exports, remains the world’s second-largest services exporter.\nchart: the economist\nBut developing economies are starting to make a mark in the more advanced types of services that can be sold overseas. Many countries export audiovisual, computer and telecommunication services. In Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine these run to more than 3% of gdp. India is the best-performing Asian country in this category; its exports fall just short of 3% of gdp. In an economy of India’s size, that means a big industry. The country’s five largest it firms have a joint market capitalisation of nearly $350bn. It is also home to 1,600 global capability centres—technology and research centres for multinational firms—that employ 3m people. All told, India’s services exports account for nearly 5% of the world’s, up from 3% a decade ago.\nThe less techy category of “technical, trade-related and other business services”, which covers things such as accounting and human resources, is another area of growth. Estonia and the Philippines top the table here, with such exports accounting for over 5% of their gdp. Like India, the latter offers low labour costs, as well as a large English-speaking population. In many countries workers also take casual gigs online. These are hard to measure, but two-thirds of the freelancers on English-speaking platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr are based in emerging economies.\nThen there is tourism. Not every country can replicate Japan’s temples or Mexico’s beaches, but many are finding ways to entice visitors, such as with medical services. Dentistry, hip replacements and hair transplants are among the treatments on offer. Costa Rica, Croatia and Moldova export health services worth between 0.2% and 0.5% of their economic output. Armenia and Jordan manage 1% each. A few hours in Istanbul airport provides a display of the thriving industry, as men return home with their heads wrapped in plastic, fresh hair taking root underneath.\nIn the short term, it seems likely that service exports will keep growing. In 1992 Stan Shih, founder of Acer, a Taiwanese computer-maker, coined the term “smile curve” to describe how value added in the manufacturing process was rising faster in the first and third parts of making a product (design and distribution, respectively) than in the second stage (manufacturing). As manufacturing has become more competitive, the smile has deepened. Think of Apple, which designs and distributes iPhones, and collects the rents from its brand, but produces none of the tech itself. Its market capitalisation is more than $3trn, whereas Foxconn, which makes 70% of the firm’s iPhones, is worth just $99bn. Even more cheerful is the fact that the rise of remote work has made firms far more comfortable with outsourcing operations. After all, a remote employee is not that different from an outsourced one.\nBut will service exports raise living standards in the manner of manufacturing? As Dani Rodrik of Harvard University notes, industry has historically possessed advantages in three areas: it is more technologically intensive, produces internationally tradable goods and creates lots of jobs. Although services is closing the gap in the first two areas, manufacturing still offers more employment.\nStart with technological growth. A factory in a poor country brings man and machine together, placing an unskilled worker at the tech frontier. Then, as the tech improves, the worker becomes still more productive. Tradable services cannot absorb unskilled workers in this manner. Yet as the World Bank has observed, since the 1990s labour-productivity growth in emerging economies outside of East Asia has risen at roughly the same rate in services as manufacturing—and services productivity has grown faster in emerging economies than rich ones. Moreover, artificial intelligence may soon provide service workers with another lift. Two experiments have found that ai tools help the least skilled knowledge workers catch up with more skilled ones when writing marketing copy and providing customer service.\nServices are also closing the gap with manufacturing when it comes to tradability, albeit slowly. Before the internet, the ability to send products overseas was the main way in which goods differed from services. Trade allows exporters to reach much larger pools of demand and achieve economies of scale that would otherwise have been beyond them. Because goods trade has been stagnant as a share of global gdp since 2010, it has become more difficult for newcomers to compete. Services trade is booming, and thus more welcoming. But even at the growth rate of the past decade, it will take 15 years to reach half the value of trade in manufactured goods.\nJob creation is an even thornier issue. Marc Lautier of the University of Rennes has calculated that, despite automation, the number of manufacturing jobs in 160 countries for which he has data has remained stable since 1991, accounting for 14% or so of total employment. The problem is that it has become more difficult for governments to attract these jobs. Manufacturing is not moving away from East Asian powerhouses at the same pace as it moved to them in the late 20th century, in part because modern factories require more capital and skill to build. Our analysis of labour-market data from 51 mostly emerging markets finds that only five—China, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Turkey and Vietnam—have 18% or more of their population employed in manufacturing, compared with 16 in 1990.\nchart: the economist\nGrowth in services offers only modest consolation, since services do not tend to offer labour density. The World Bank notes that, since 1990, service jobs have risen from 40% to 50% of global employment, as workers left agriculture. But just 5-10% of emerging-market service jobs are in tradable, techy industries, compared with 15-20% in rich countries. India’s it industry may garner $250bn in annual exports, worth nearly 8% of the country’s gdp, which is on a par with manufactured exports. Yet it only employs 8m people from a working-age population of around 1bn.\nIn the longer run, ai might cause problems. Models are best at well-defined tasks that do not need in-person context. That makes business services vulnerable. A report by Capital Economics, a consultancy, argues that ai could lead to the “slow demise” of India’s services exports, cutting growth by 0.3-0.4 percentage points a year over the next decade. The spread of communication tech has facilitated services outsourcing. Fresh technological change could, in time, be its undoing.\nDespite the downsides of a services-oriented approach to development, especially when it comes to providing decent jobs in large numbers, developing economies simply have fewer choices today than they once did. Governments that want to boost growth will therefore have to focus on different things. Whereas they once had reason to ensure that workers could easily move from farms to factories, today they would be better off paying attention to human capital among future white-collar workers. Richard Baldwin of imd Business School says that large, well-functioning cities will take on greater importance, too, since services often depend on agglomeration. Getting services right, especially those which can be sold overseas, is now a crucial condition for growth. ■\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

Asian eateries were the first to snap up Mr Tran’s hot sauce, but before long the green-nozzled bottle, with its distinctive rooster logo, had become a staple in restaurants and pantries alike. Within just a few years Mr Tran went from hawking his wares out of a Chevy van in Los Angeles to walking the floor of a 20,000-square-metre factory. By 2020 his business was worth $1bn.\nSince then, however, it has suffered a meltdown. First came grumblings by fans that the condiment had lost its vibrant crimson colour and peppery punch. Next came the shortages. Enthusiasts soon panicked and began to hoard the stuff. At one point last year resale prices for Huy Fong’s sauce on eBay, an e-commerce site, reached as high as $150 per bottle. To cap it off, last month the company announced it was halting production until at least September.\nFor decades Huy Fong set its sriracha apart with fresh jalapeños reddened on the vine, a difficult commodity to grow at scale. Competitors turned to dried chillies. Mr Tran turned to Craig Underwood, a Californian with a penchant for peppers. For 28 years Underwood Ranches, his company, met all Huy Fong’s jalapeño needs, at one point producing close to 45,000 tonnes a year. To fill Huy Fong’s bottles, Underwood Ranches expanded its acreage ten-fold. The two men became chums. In 2017, however, the relationship soured following a disagreement between Mr Tran and Mr Underwood over financial terms.\nAlthough Mr Tran scrambled to find new growers, turning south to Mexico, none has been able to reliably meet his exacting requirements. “It wasn’t easy to put together that supply chain,” Mr Underwood explains. Huy Fong’s woes began in earnest once its reserves began to run out in 2020.\nCompetitors have been all too willing to step into the gap left by the sriracha pioneer. McIlhenny, which makes Tabasco, a rival hot sauce, began peddling its own sriracha product with a campaign promising “no shortage of flavour inspiration”. In the second half of last year its condiment was the bestselling sriracha sauce in America. Other brands have had a boost, too. Even Underwood Ranches has piled in with its own product, trading on its reputation as Huy Fong’s erstwhile supplier. If there is one lesson from Mr Tran’s debacle, then, it is to keep your friends close—and your jalapeños closer.■\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

        "body": "Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\nYour browser does not support the <audio> element.\nI\nn the diplomacy around the forever war between Israel and the Palestinians, it is customary to describe a Palestinian state as a necessity. Consider the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal, backed by America and all the other countries on the un’s 15-strong Security Council bar Russia, which abstained. It outlines the global community’s “unwavering” commitment to a two-state solution “where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace”. It also insists that Gaza must be unified with the West Bank under the authority of the Palestinian Authority (pa). Most countries believe that Palestine should be recognised as a full-fledged state immediately, before any peace deal is struck between Israel and the Palestinians. On May 10th 143 countries at the un supported this idea. On May 28th they were joined by Ireland, Norway and Spain.\nSome visions of this new state are inspiring. Palestine Emerging, a study by 100 experts released in April, foresees Gaza and the West Bank by 2050 as a single entity of 13m people, up from around 5m today, connected by a railway, replete with nature reserves and an airport. The devastation in Gaza creates a clean slate on which a new city will be built, with a seaport on an island linked to the mainland by a causeway. Palestine would prosper as a trading entrepot, its currency pegged to the dollar, underwritten by the rich Gulf states. Yet when you look away from such hopeful blueprints, the gap between the dream and reality is crushingly large.\nRead more of our coverage of the Israel-Hamas war\nPalestinian statehood last seemed imminent a quarter of a century ago. The Oslo accords signed between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993 and 1995 created a semi-autonomous body, the pa, in Gaza and the West Bank. Had everything gone to plan, a final accord would have turned the pa into a sovereign state with fixed borders in 1999. But the assassination in 1995 of Yitzhak Rabin, Israel’s prime minister, by a Jewish extremist removed one of the most forceful advocates of peace. The process unravelled further amid a surge in bus-bombings and other terrorist attacks on Israeli and Palestinian civilians and a rapid expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which was meant to form the core of the new Palestinian state.\nWhen talks brokered by America over a two-state deal broke down in 2000, a second intifada (uprising) erupted, which burned until 2005 and saw Israeli tanks return to Palestinian cities. Then in 2007, almost two years after Israel had dismantled its settlements in Gaza and withdrawn its troops, the armed Islamists of Hamas, who won a general election covering both territories in 2006, took control of the coastal enclave. Yet the pa has limped on as a political mutant, partly as a government and partly an instrument of Israeli occupation, its remit limited to the West Bank. Many countries recognise Palestine as a state, but the un Security Council does not. Without clear borders or its own army and police in sole charge of security, it lacks some essential characteristics.\nSince Oslo the Palestinian territories have changed a great deal, even before the destruction of Gaza. In some respects these changes make it a more credible state than it was in the 1990s. For example, Palestinians spend 2.4 more years in education than they did two decades ago, making them one of the most literate populations in the Middle East. In the early 1990s Gaza and the West Bank scored 0.53 on the un’s Human Development Index (one is the highest), based on health, wealth and education. By 2022 it had climbed to 0.716, ahead of Morocco.\nThe share of imports that come from Israel has fallen from 79% in 1995-99 to 57% in 2022, making the West Bank less dependent on Israeli inputs. On the ground and at international forums like the World Economic Forum in Davos, the pa has acquired institutional heft. In May it marked 30 years in existence. Its tenacity in the face of adversity has heightened its aspirations. “The jacket [of Oslo] no longer fits us,” says Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador in London. But 30 years after Oslo, the would-be state faces glaring problems: a faltering economy, territorial fragmentation, lack of security and autocracy.\nStart with the economy. With a gdp of around $18.6bn in 2023 the Palestinian territories are the world’s 127th biggest economy. In areas of the West Bank under the pa’s control income per person is 43% of the global average, on a par with Iraq. There are islands of prosperity. In Ramallah, the seat of government, gated communities and shopping complexes abound and plenty of new houses and apartment blocks have risen up. And however flawed the pa has been, its economic performance far exceeds Hamas’s in its besieged enclave of Gaza. On the eve of Hamas’s attack on October 7th, incomes per person in the West Bank were five times higher than those in Gaza. Unemployment in the third quarter of 2023 was 13% in the West Bank, compared with 45% in Gaza.\nYet for all that, the economy is fragile and dominated by Israel. In a report before the October 7th attacks the imf described a “fiscal crisis” in which the pa was massively in arrears. The Palestinian territories recorded a current-account deficit of around 12% of gdp, with imports far exceeding formal exports.\nThe Palestinian economy depends heavily on Israel. Though the pa has improved its own tax collection, some 8% of its 15bn shekels ($4bn) of annual revenue comes from foreign aid and 67% comes from taxes that Israel gathers on its behalf. About 90% of exports go to Israel and more than 180,000 Palestinians, around 23% of the West Bank’s workforce, were employed there before October 7th. After the Hamas attack Israel cancelled almost all the work permits previously granted to Palestinians, suspended the transfer of tax revenue and tightly restricted movement out of and within the West Bank. “It’s the Palestinians’ worst economic crisis since 1967,” says Yitzhak Gal, an Israeli economist. To these immediate hits should be added the costs of rebuilding Gaza, which the un reckons could be $40bn (estimates vary widely), and providing for its people. Foreign donors may pay for much of this. Even so, the pa’s finances might buckle if it were to assume responsibility for Gaza.\nSecurity is just as bad. The pa has survived in part because Israel needs it to. In 1987, when the Palestinians unleashed their first intifada, Israel had to send in lots of troops to suppress the unrest. For most of the past three decades, however, the Palestinians have largely policed themselves and maintained order in the West Bank.\nUnsteady state\nYet if one definition of a state is determined by whether it has defined borders and a monopoly on the use of force within them, then the pa may be further away from statehood than it was in the years after Oslo. The number of Israeli settlers living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has risen from roughly 250,000 to about 695,000 today. Maps show the West Bank is far more densely peppered with settler outposts. Palestinians are cut off from East Jerusalem, their putative capital, and from Gaza. They are splintered by Oslo’s division of the West Bank into Areas A, B and C (see map), denoting differing levels of control by Israel and the pa. “They’re increasingly fragmented into bantustans,” says Alon Cohen Lifshitz, director of an Israeli planning watchdog, Bimkom, referring to the nominally self-governing territories under apartheid in South Africa.\nmap: the economist\nSince the Hamas attack last October, Israel has killed over 500 Palestinians in the West Bank and Israeli checkpoints have stifled movement around Palestinian cities. Journeys that should take half an hour can take three. Israel has suspended security co-ordination with the pa. And increasingly Israel treats Area A, where the pa is supposed to have full control, as if it were Area C, where Israel has it. Israel regularly sends troops on raids into cities such as Ramallah and Jenin to suppress militant groups the pa has struggled to control, including those loyal to Hamas. Palestinians say these raids are intended to weaken the pa’s hold and erode public confidence in it.\nThen there is the pa’s autocratic leadership. Superficially the political system is stable and looks more or less legitimate. “Of course partial occupation is better than full occupation,” says a Palestinian official. Many appreciate the sense of order that the pa brings. Yet there is a vast lack of accountability and the legitimacy is questionable. In November Mahmoud Abbas, the supine 88-year-old Palestinian president, will have ruled for 20 of the pa’s 30 years. Under Mr Abbas, Fatah, the main faction in the West Bank, forsook the violence of the second intifada.\nYet Mr Abbas has turned a fledgling democracy into a dictatorship. In 2006, a year after he was elected president, he held a parliamentary election which Hamas won (getting 44% of the vote to Fatah’s 41%). But he dismissed a Hamas-led government, dissolved parliament and has postponed all subsequent elections ever since. He has purged his institutions of critics and has repeatedly rejected proposals for a national unity government, which might have reunified Gaza and the West Bank, for fear that a deal with Hamas might cost him Western support. Detractors dub the pa “al-amila”, the agent [of Israel].\nYears of autocratic rule have entrenched cronyism. “Fatah has become a company,” says a journalist in Ramallah. Corruption erodes public support. The pa pays its bills selectively and stuffs its administration with party cadres. Lamis al-Alami, a former education minister, says she sacked thousands of politically appointed teachers. After she left office, she says, they promptly resumed their posts.\nSince the attacks of October 7th there have been changes. In March Mr Abbas appointed a new prime minister, Mohammad Mustafa, a former economics adviser. But America has backed away from trying to force Mr Abbas to surrender some of his powers to his prime minister and government. The prospect of elections is remote. Mr Abbas and his Arab and Western backers are wary of democracy in the West Bank. In a survey published on June 12th by psr, a Palestinian research body, only 8% of West Bankers say they have been satisfied by Mr Abbas’s performance in this war; 94% want him to resign. Some 41% of respondents say they support Hamas, a notably higher share than before the war, compared with 17% who support Fatah.\nThe economic fragility, insecurity and political weakness of the pa suggest it would be able to play a limited role in Gaza if asked to take control immediately. It retains a presence in Gaza’s hospitals and runs its registry of births and deaths. It has 37,000 employees on its Gaza payroll, including 19,000 in the security forces, though most have stayed at home for almost two decades under Mr Abbas’s orders not to co-operate with Hamas. The pa mulls plans to train thousands of security people in Jordan and send them to Gaza. But neither Israel nor Hamas has included the pa in ceasefire negotiations or in providing aid. When the pa tried to distribute supplies independently of Hamas, six of its men were killed.\nThe bigger question for many Palestinians is not whether the pa can reimpose its rule in Gaza, but whether it can survive in the West Bank without a political horizon and faced with Israel’s intransigence. Israelis have steadily become more hostile to Palestinian rights. In May Pew, a pollster, found that only 26% of Israeli adults said the Jewish state could coexist peacefully with a future Palestine state, down from 50% a decade ago.\nFor some Palestinians the status quo is a lesser evil than provoking their foes. “It’s not the time for resistance,” says the owner of a new café in the West Bank city of Nablus who was once a militant. “We’d just give the settlers an opportunity to destroy what we’ve built.” For others, though, the attractions of violence are rising. “If the result of peaceful resistance is continued occupation, then we should reconsider our options,” says one of Ramallah’s biggest businessmen. “It’s the first time anyone forced Israel back from the border and got 200 soldiers to surrender,” says an Abbas loyalist of the Hamas attack. The target of violence could be Israel, the settlers or the pa. And the latest impulses of the Palestinian electorate are alarming. A recent psr survey found that 62% of West Bankers favoured an armed struggle. Two-thirds of Palestinians thought the Hamas attacks were “correct”; 91% denied that Hamas had committed atrocities against civilians.\nSome inside Fatah have considered marching on Mr Abbas’s fortress in Ramallah to topple him. Jihadist notions of takfir, or excommunication, are gaining ground, says a former member of Islamic Jihad, a militant faction, in Nablus. Some shabab (young men), he says, are swayed by the idea that the pa is an apostate regime. So they refuse to pay taxes and they clash with the security forces. Small groups are plotting attacks on Israel and its settlers.\nIf violence is one way for Palestinians to disrupt the status quo, another is diplomacy and, in particular, the calls for the immediate international recognition of a Palestinian state. Though three-quarters of the world’s countries have recognised Palestinian statehood, America and most main European powers have not. One argument for recognition is symbolic. Governments also argue that by signalling support for the two-state plan they can prevent extremists on both sides from killing off a two-state settlement. It is less plausible that recognition will have any immediate effect on the ground.\nState of change\nMichael Sfard, an Israeli lawyer, sees little changing. “Recognition of Palestine doesn’t end the occupation or change the validity of the Oslo accords,” he says. Yet others think it would have rapid effects, including on the settlers. “All nationalities including Israelis would have to apply to live in our state and abide by our laws. This can’t happen as a fait accompli,” says Mr Zomlot. “The resources—land, water, minerals—are taken from our state and must be taxed.” With clearer legal sovereignty, Palestinians could seek to tap their own resources, like offshore gas, and sign defence pacts. Some argue a new state could even seek to take control of the border crossings with Jordan and Egypt.\nYet the interconnectedness of Israel with its settlements and the West Bank means that a unilateral act of separation could be incendiary, provoking an Israeli response. “If the un [Security Council] recognises a Palestine state, the Oslo accords would be rendered irrelevant because they deal with something less than a state,” says Itzik Bam, a settler lawyer and ally of Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s ultranationalist finance minister. “We’ll stop transferring tax money that we collect for you, cancel all your vip cards for freedom of movement and watch you collapse.”\nAs the war in Gaza drags on, the prospect of a Palestinian state is at once more relevant than ever and yet more distant. Trust on both sides has been shattered by the Hamas attacks and the Israeli response. The path towards statehood would require new leadership of the pa (or a successor organisation) and the rebuilding of its democratic credentials; a plan for what to do in Gaza when Israel’s invasion ends and for its reunification with the West Bank; and a new centrist government in Israel ready to negotiate an end to the conflict with the Palestinians. Outsiders would have to apply heavy pressure on both sides to work towards an agreement. Israel and the Palestinians would have to compromise. The notion of a democratic Palestinian state alongside Israel is still a dream. But the alternative, of ceaseless Palestinian atrophy, is one that offers the region only misery, extremism and war. ■\nSign up to the Middle East Dispatch, a weekly newsletter that keeps you in the loop on a fascinating, complex and consequential part of the world.",

It is repeated by the few residents remaining in the near-deserted towns and villages near the border, which have been under fire for eight months from Hizbullah, the Iran-backed movement that controls much of Lebanon. It is also an accusation levelled at the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, which has failed to find a way to stop the barrage of missiles and drones that Hizbullah began firing on October 8th, the day after Hamas’s attack on Israel. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hizbullah, recently vowed to continue the attacks, insisting that his group is a “support front” for Hamas.\n“We’re like ducks in Nasrallah’s shooting-range,” says Gidi Sayada, a winemaker from Safsufa, a village that has not been evacuated. “My daughters have been sleeping in the safe-room of our house for the past eight months.” Hizbullah has shelled mainly targets close by the border and military bases. Israel has responded with targeted strikes on Hizbullah people, in some cases deep inside Lebanon.\nmap: the economist\nThough neither side has unleashed anything near its full arsenal, the cross-border fire has increased since mid-May and last week reached its most intense level since the start of the war. Using data from a nasa satellite system and a machine-learning algorithm to track war-related fires, The Economist has counted the number of strikes occurring on both sides of the border (see map and chart). In the week ending on June 16th there were 640 such strikes, 254 of them on June 13th alone.\nRead more of our coverage of the Israel-Hamas war\nThough a measure of calm has returned in recent days, perhaps due to Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holiday, the fighting has upended lives in Lebanon and Israel. Early in the war Israel evacuated people living within 2km of the border. Some 60,000 have yet to return. Across the border in southern Lebanon more than 90,000 have also fled.\nIn numerical terms, Israel has caused more damage to Hizbullah, killing over 300 of its operatives during this period as well as around 100 civilians; 28 people have been killed in Israel. On June 12th an Israeli air strike killed Taleb Sami Abdallah, a senior Hizbullah member in command of its forces in southern Lebanon. But these strikes have not lessened the desperation among Israelis in the north.\nchart: the economist\nThe continuing bombardment and the evacuation of civilians in Israel are leading to increasing calls for Mr Netanyahu’s government to act more forcefully against Hizbullah. “It’s hell here right now, so we may as well have an all-out war with Lebanon,” says Danielle Levy, an exhausted police volunteer from Safed. This is a sentiment widely heard in the region. The political pressure on Mr Netanyahu is particularly intense because many of the civilians most affected are among his core supporters. In Kiryat Shmona, the largest border town, three-quarters of the electorate voted for Likud, Mr Netanyahu’s party, or its allies in the last election, but it is now impossible to hear a good word said about the prime minister. “We’re totally abandoned and the government are a bunch of muppets,” says Shimon Maimon, a retired painter. The prime minister is also being pressed by his far-right coalition partners to escalate. But for now the leaders on both sides want to avoid all-out war.\nStill, with the fighting in Gaza being scaled down, some Israel Defence Forces (idf) units have been redeployed to the north where they are preparing for a ground offensive against Hizbullah. On June 18th the idf announced that its general command had “authorised operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon”. In such a scenario Israel would seek to occupy a “security zone” that would put northern communities out of range of some of Hizbullah’s missiles. But a ground incursion would almost certainly trigger a fiercer response from Hizbullah, which would probably launch long-range missiles that could hit targets deep within Israel. To prevent this, Israel might strike the missile-launchers and Hizbullah’s headquarters first, many of which are in civilian areas. Heavy civilian casualties in both Lebanon and Israel are a certainty in such a war. \nIsrael’s American allies have been urging it to hold fire. Amos Hochstein, an adviser to President Joe Biden, has been trying to craft a ceasefire between Israel and Hizbullah. Mr Netanyahu seems open to this idea, though he is less keen on agreeing to stop fighting in Gaza.\nIsraeli generals insist that the idf can fight on two fronts. But they admit that doing so would drastically stretch the army. “To take over southern Lebanon we’ll need a lot more troops, but meanwhile most of the units are in or around Gaza,” says one reserve commander who has been on exercises preparing for such an operation. “The plans feel incomplete.”\nThe idf would like to pause the war against Hamas, preferably through a ceasefire that would also secure the release of the 120 hostages still in Gaza. But a truce in Gaza would probably prompt Hizbullah also to stop firing. That would leave Israel’s leaders with the dilemma of whether to start a new war to push the group away from the border or to allow it to remain in a position to threaten Israeli communities.\nThe consensus within Israel’s security establishment is that war with Hizbullah is inevitable. But increasingly the view among the generals is that it should not take place soon. Major-General Yitzhak Gershon, who served recently as the second-in-command of the northern front, published an article on June 13th saying that although he had been in favour of attacking Hizbullah immediately on October 7th, he had since changed his mind.\n“Israel should be headed to a diplomatic arrangement, not war, at this time,” he wrote, adding that its strategy in the past eight months had amounted to a “mad run with the head into a wall”. The country, he argued, needs a ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon in order to take stock, elect a new government and regroup. “We should choose the timing [of any war],” says one veteran intelligence analyst, “and not be dragged into it by Nasrallah.” ■\nSign up to the Middle East Dispatch, a weekly newsletter that keeps you in the loop on a fascinating, complex and consequential part of the world.",

Senior Israeli officers rushed to extol the commandos who carried out the mission, one of whom was killed, and the accurate intelligence that located the two apartments in the crowded Nuseirat refugee camp where they were incarcerated. But officials were just as quick to dampen expectations that the remaining 120 Israeli hostages held by Hamas could be rescued in a similar fashion.\nIt was a “unique combination of intelligence and operational circumstances”, explained one general. But Israeli security officials still reckon that a deal will have to be struck with their enemies if most of the remaining hostages kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th are to be freed.\nRead more of our coverage of the Israel-Hamas war\nFor the people of Gaza the Israeli operation emphasised just how bleak their situation remains. According to the Hamas-run health authorities, at least 274 people were killed in the operation, as Israeli forces rained down covering fire to protect the escape route used by the hostages and commandos. Israel disputes these figures and claims that many of those killed were fighters. Whatever the exact number, a ceasefire cannot come too soon for the civilians caught in the crossfire.\nAntony Blinken, the American secretary of state, arrived in the region on June 10th to promote the ceasefire agreement presented by President Joe Biden ten days earlier. The deal, based on an Israeli proposal, has a three-stage framework. The first phase is a six-week truce, during which Israel would withdraw from the urban areas in Gaza and Hamas would release some of the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\nSimultaneously, a second stage would begin with negotiations through intermediaries towards a longer-lasting ceasefire and the release of male Israeli soldiers held by Hamas and of more Palestinian prisoners. A third phase would see the return of the bodies of dead hostages and the start of a programme to rebuild the devastated Gaza Strip.\nThe bridge player’s card\nShortly after Mr Blinken’s arrival in Qatar’s capital, Doha, Hamas made its formal response through Qatari brokers. A source in the office of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, was quick to pronounce that Hamas had rejected the deal. Mr Blinken was more sanguine. Hamas, he said, had proposed “numerous” changes, but some of them were “workable”. He believed “those gaps are bridgeable”.\nUnlike the Israelis, the Americans remain, at least outwardly, upbeat when it comes to the prospects for a deal. On June 10th America sponsored a resolution in the un Security Council favouring the accord. It passed with only Russia abstaining.\nNeither Israel nor Hamas is particularly inclined to accept something with the un’s imprimatur. The vote in the Security Council seems to be an attempt by the Americans to show that the proposal is still up and running, even if at present it is only running on the spot.\nThe fundamental difference between the two sides is that Israel wants to see more of its 120 hostages (at least 43 of whom are already presumed dead) returned before it makes any long-term promises. Hamas, meanwhile, is demanding that Israel commits to withdrawing from all of Gaza and accepts a long-term ceasefire before any hostages are freed.\nStill, the true positions of the two sides are hard to assess. Hamas took more than two weeks to respond. Its leadership is thought to be split. The “outside” politburo, based mainly in Doha, is susceptible to international pressure, making it more open to a deal. Hamas’s Qatari hosts have threatened its leaders with banishment from their opulent lodgings if they reject the deal. However, the final word will be had by Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s chief in Gaza and the mastermind of the massacre on October 7th.\nMr Sinwar seems unmoved by the possibility of upheaval in his colleagues’ living conditions. But he is under growing pressure to accept a deal. His decision to attack Israel has brought terrible destruction upon Gaza and led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians. He can only justify this to Palestinians if he manages to secure the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in return for the hostages. This latest Israeli operation highlighted that he may be running out of bargaining chips. Hamas has also been criticised in Gaza for holding the hostages in densely populated areas, which has resulted in high numbers of casualties during both this and previous rescue missions.\nTo make matters even murkier, Hamas’s responses take some time to come through because Mr Sinwar must be consulted at every stage. He is believed to be hiding somewhere in the tunnel network beneath Gaza. He communicates only through runners carrying written notes, to avoid giving his location away to the Israelis. As a result, any changes in Hamas’s position will take days to relay.\nThe Israeli position is not much clearer. The proposal being discussed ostensibly came from the Israeli government and Mr Netanyahu has admitted that he stands behind it. But it was formulated by the war cabinet, a small forum where Mr Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners are not represented—and they have threatened to resign from his governing coalition if it becomes policy. What is more, the war cabinet that issued the proposal weeks ago has now changed. It no longer includes the centrist ministers Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot. They resigned from the government on June 9th, along with the other members of their National Unity party.\nMr Gantz explained in a press conference that “crucial strategic decisions are being blocked by hesitation and political considerations”. He had given the prime minister a three-week deadline to come up with a comprehensive strategy for ending the war in Gaza. Mr Netanyahu failed to meet it, he said. Earlier in the day at a cabinet meeting the prime minister accused Mr Gantz of engaging in “small-time politics” and of bolting from the government “at the height of war”. That is rich coming from a leader who has spent the past eight months doing all he can to save his political career.\nMr Gantz had been under intense pressure for months from the opposition to leave Mr Netanyahu’s government and join those calling for his resignation. Mr Gantz stayed in the war cabinet in the hope of clinching the ceasefire agreement. His decision to leave was explained more bluntly by Mr Eisenkot, who said the government “had completely failed” in all its objectives.\nTheir departure is another sign of the bleak prospects for an agreement. Mr Gantz and Mr Eisenkot do not think Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza is over. But they both believe it can—and should—be paused, at least for some months, to allow for the release of the surviving hostages and to start building an alternative authority to run Gaza instead of Hamas. Their joint decision to resign is a result of their frustration at Mr Netanyahu’s refusal to accept their plan.\nHe just won’t go\nNational Unity’s departure will not bring down the government or force elections; Mr Netanyahu still clings on with a small majority. But it leaves him depending entirely on the far right. Mr Gantz joined the government eight months ago on condition that the extremists in the government be excluded from the war cabinet. Now the prime minister will have to contend with them on his own. The leader of the Jewish Power party, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has already demanded membership of “the most relevant and intimate forums”, namely the war cabinet, in the remaining coalition. Mr Ben-Gvir and the leader of Religious Zionism, Bezalel Smotrich, want Israel to beef up its operations both in Gaza and against Hizbullah, the Shia militia that has been launching missiles into northern Israel from Lebanon. Both party leaders have promised to leave the government if a ceasefire deal with Hamas is reached.\nEven if Mr Blinken is right and the gap between Israel and Hamas is “bridgeable”, the internal differences on either side mean his mission has but a slim chance. ■\nSign up to the Middle East Dispatch, a weekly newsletter that keeps you in the loop on a fascinating, complex and consequential part of the world.",

For those who remain, the fighting has had grisly consequences. At least 45 people, including a number of children, died on May 26th after an Israeli air strike set fire to a tent camp; survivors had to pull charred bodies from the wreckage. Even those who evacuated are not entirely safe: dozens more were killed two days later in a strike near al-Mawasi, a so-called “humanitarian zone” for displaced civilians.\nLess macabre, but just as consequential, is what the offensive has done to the flows of aid that have kept 2.2m Palestinians alive throughout eight months of war. Consider the statistics from one recent day. The Israeli army said that 370 lorries of aid reached Gaza on May 27th, 154 of them via Kerem Shalom, a border crossing in the south. Yet the un’s official tally from that day recorded zero lorries at Kerem Shalom. Neither side is lying—nor, though, are they telling the whole truth. The confusing figures show how Israel’s campaign in Rafah has complicated deliveries of aid.\nRead all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas\nUntil it began, most of the aid reaching Gaza did so by lorry in the south, where it was collected by the un. Of the 27,608 lorries that entered between the start of the war and May 6th, around 25,000 went via the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings (see map). Over 90% of those lorries delivered goods to the un and other charities; only a small fraction carried cargo ordered by private firms.\nmap: the economist\nDeliveries reached an all-time high in April, when 5,671 lorries entered Gaza via the two southern crossings. There were also new routes for shipments to other parts of the enclave. In May Israel opened a new crossing, called West Erez, which could handle deliveries in the north. America inaugurated a temporary pier to receive supplies by sea. After months of shortages, aid workers were hopeful that the humanitarian situation was improving.\nThen Israeli troops began their push into Rafah. It has caused two big problems. First is the supply of aid. Egypt stopped sending lorries to the Rafah crossing after Israeli troops seized it. Kerem Shalom has, at times, been too dangerous to use (partly because Hamas keeps firing rockets at it). The week before the Rafah offensive began, the un received 1,601 lorries through those crossings; the week after, it recorded 63 (see chart). Most lorries entering in the south are now bound for private firms, not charities. They show up in Israel’s statistics, but not in the un’s.\nchart: the economist\nOn most days the West Erez crossing now handles a majority of the aid entering Gaza. In the two weeks before the Rafah offensive, just 94 aid lorries used that route; in the two weeks after it began, 465 of them did. That is a five-fold increase, but it does not make up for the much larger drop in aid flows in the south.\nNor does the maritime route. In its first week the American-built pier received around 1,100 tonnes of aid—the equivalent of eight lorries a day. On May 28th the Pentagon said the pier had been damaged and needed to be towed to Israel for repairs.\nMoreover, both the pier and the West Erez crossing are in northern Gaza, which has been largely depopulated. That points to a second issue. The daily figures from the Israeli army count all the lorries that clear security screening and unload their goods on the Gazan side of the border. But those deliveries are little help to Gazans unless someone can pick up the supplies and deliver them where they are needed.\nUntil May 6th, the un was largely responsible for that: it sent hundreds of lorries each day to collect aid from the southern crossings. With most of Gaza’s 2.2m people huddled in Rafah, most aid stayed there as well; many un lorries had to drive only a few kilometres to drop their cargo at warehouses and government offices.\nNow, though, the un says it is often too dangerous to send drivers to Kerem Shalom. Since May 6th it has dispatched just 169 lorries (an average of seven a day). On May 21st the un halted food distribution in Rafah, citing logistical glitches. Deliveries in the north can be fraught as well: much of the aid that came via the American-built pier was seized by hungry crowds before it reached un warehouses.\nPrivate firms have fewer qualms about security: they send dozens of lorries to Kerem Shalom each day to collect goods and deliver them to makeshift markets. With less aid entering Gaza, these markets are now a vital lifeline. But shoppers say the prices are often high and erratic.\nThis makes for a bleak picture. Food, medicine and other essentials are still getting into Gaza, but some shipments are stuck in staging areas on the border. Others are sold at prices that few Gazans can afford. Israel, though, insists that it is meeting its duties under international law.\nWarring states have no duty to feed the enemy, only a “duty to facilitate”: they must allow neutral parties to deliver humanitarian aid, which Israel has done with the un. But those duties change if they become occupying powers. Then they must “ensure the provision” of basic supplies. It is not enough passively to allow food into the territory; occupiers must themselves actively provide supplies if they are needed and cannot get through by other means.\nUnder international law, an army becomes an occupying power once it can exercise “effective control” over a territory. The meaning of that phrase is debated. Many Israeli lawyers argue their country cannot be deemed to occupy Gaza: it has not set up a formal administration there, and its troops have withdrawn from many areas they once controlled. Perhaps Israel has been the occupying power for limited periods in particular areas, they concede, but not in Gaza as a whole.\nYet Israel now controls all of Gaza’s land borders, its coastline and its air space. It has thousands of troops in Rafah, a smaller number deployed along a corridor that bisects the enclave, and the freedom to send forces anywhere it wishes. It has not set up a military government for Gaza—but it has the power to do so.\nTo many, that looks like effective control. David Cameron, Britain’s foreign secretary, called Israel an occupying power in March. On May 20th a panel of experts convened by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court found that Israel was “certainly” an occupying power “in all of or at least in substantial parts of Gaza”. The prosecutor accused Israel’s prime minister and its defence minister of inflicting “starvation as a method of war” in his request for arrest warrants in May.\nFor almost eight months, Israel has resisted calls to deliver aid to Gazans directly and urged the un to do more. But the fighting in Rafah has left the un paralysed. Whatever the legal arguments, if the offensive leads to greater hunger and disease in Gaza, many will hold Israel responsible. ■\nSign up to the Middle East Dispatch, a weekly newsletter that keeps you in the loop on a fascinating, complex and consequential part of the world.",

        "body": "F\nor most people in Belgorod, a once quiet and comfortable Russian city 40km from the Ukrainian border, the war started on December 30th 2023, almost two years after it started in Ukraine. That day the centre of Belgorod was hit by a Ukrainian rocket, killing 25 civilians, including two children, and wounding more than a hundred. Since then the city and the province that surrounds it have been attacked almost daily. Some 200 civilians have died and 800 have been wounded. Small numbers compared with what Ukraine has endured; but far more than anywhere else in Russia.\nMikhail Ivankiv, a 22-year-old final-year student at Belgorod State University, had just finished shopping for New Year presents for his parents and his fiancée. That New Year was supposed to be the start of his new life, his father says. “He had found his first job, and was about to move in with his fiancée. They planned to celebrate New Year’s eve together and he said he would come and see us the next day.” He never did. A few days later Mikhail died in hospital, after losing both his legs.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\nMr Ivankiv senior, an ethnic Ukrainian, was born and bred in Soviet Kazakhstan, where his grandfather, a native of western Ukraine, was exiled after spending several years in Stalin’s gulag. He grew up a Soviet man, served in the Soviet army and lived in Pskov, in north-western Russia. In 2013 the family moved to Belgorod. They were attracted by its mild southern climate, its modern feel, its fertile agricultural land and its proximity to Ukraine, where many of their relatives lived.\nKharkiv and Belgorod, 80km apart and connected by a highway, were not just formally sister cities; they formed a common historic, cultural and linguistic space. Belgorod was settled by free Ukrainian peasants and Cossacks who fled Polish rule and Tatar raids. There was no distinction between the accents and dialects. It was a rare family in Belgorod that did not have relatives on the other side of the border.\nFor Belgorod, a city of 340,000 people, Kharkiv was a capital. A metropolis four times its size, “Kharkiv had a greater influence on us than Moscow or St Petersburg,” says Noize mc, a Russian rapper and singer, who was born and bred in Belgorod and gained fame in Kharkiv. Kharkiv had cooler bars and bigger shopping malls and cinemas. It had a McDonald’s that attracted schoolchildren from Belgorod, and the Barabashova open-air market, one of the largest in Europe, that drew traders and buyers from Russia and across the former Soviet Union. The border between Belgorod and Kharkiv was largely notional.\nmap: the economist\nIn 2014 that changed. That is when Russian forces first invaded Donbas and tried to incite strife in Kharkiv. The border between Belgorod and Kharkiv solidified and the fortunes of Barabashova turned sour. In 2022 Russian missiles hit the market, turning 15 hectares of stalls (nearly 20% of the whole) to rubble. But the war has also turned Belgorod into a front-line city.\nOver the past few months it has been hit by everything that flies, including rockets and kamikaze drones fired from Ukraine, debris that falls from the sky when Russian air defence intercepts them, and Russian glide-bombs destined for Kharkiv but frequently released prematurely by accident. That is what happened on May 4th when a 500-kilogram bomb damaged 30 houses and ten cars and wounded seven civilians, including a child.\nOnce popular for its new housing and good schools, Belgorod now excels in concrete shelters, online schooling and regular drills on how to resuscitate, bandage and tourniquet the wounded; once a champion of attracting migrants from across the country, it now has a record outflow of people. Some 26,000 houses have been damaged, and 9,000 children have been evacuated. Those who have stayed are studying remotely. Elena Koneva, founder of ExtremeScan Group, a sociology-research group, estimates that 150,000 people have relocated from the province.\nWhile many people are heading out of Belgorod, columns of military vehicles are heading in. According to the Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank in Washington, Russia has concentrated some 30,000 troops in the Belgorod region. Most of the time they remain invisible to civilians, but on June 1st a man in Belgorod died when a drunk tank driver rammed his car.\nVladimir Putin claims that the purpose of his stalled push into Kharkiv is to protect Belgorod from being shelled. If so, his bombs are having the opposite effect. And people in Belgorod know that when Russia bombs Kharkiv, they also suffer. “When we hear that Russia has launched a big attack, everybody anticipates an avenging strike,” says Timofey, a journalist and activist.\nUkrainian commanders in Kharkiv say attacks on Belgorod have a dual purpose. One is to take out military infrastructure. The other is to drive the war home to people in Russia. Although the former is a legitimate act of war, the latter smacks of retribution against civilians.\nBut if anything, being drawn into war has consolidated Belgorod. Nearly 70% of its people are volunteering: collecting money, joining territorial defence, staffing hospitals, says Ms Koneva. Her research shows that support for Mr Putin’s “special military operation” is 5-7% higher than in Russia as a whole; not because they wish death on their neighbours, but because they fear retribution from Ukraine. This fear breeds anxiety, a sense of despair, depression and alienation, rather than any real enthusiasm Ms Koneva says.\nDespite his loss, Mr Ivankiv feels no hatred towards Ukrainians on the other side of the border, not even its soldiers. “They are people like us and their soldiers are also someone’s brothers, husbands, fathers.” He blames the governments of both countries for the war and describes it not as an act of Russia’s aggression but as a tragic occurrence. Like many people across Russia he knows that what is happening is not right, but in talking about the war he invokes familiar propaganda tropes about Ukrainian nationalists, America’s meddling in Ukraine or nato’s threat to Russia; a psychological safety-blanket, perhaps, that helps him survive his grief.\nAs a dutiful citizen, says Mr Ivankiv, he never gave up on his country and he participates in elections, including the latest presidential one, in March. (He would not say whom he voted for, but that hardly matters since that election offered no choice.) Belgorod came under particularly heavy fire during the three days of voting; most people in Belgorod did not risk coming out. A reporter for Novaya Gazeta, one of the very few independent news outlets left in Russia, described empty polling stations. This did not stop Channel One, a flagship state propaganda channel, from reporting long queues of voters. Novaya Gazeta summed up the election result: “Turnout–87%, ten people dead, 68 wounded. Victory for Vladimir Putin.”\nFor many people, particularly the young ones who did not bother participating in the farce, that result was a clear sign of the disconnect between their reality and Kremlin politics. “Moscow just does not give a toss about Belgorod,” says Timofey. But just in case, the government has been throwing money and perks at Belgorod. On May 31st Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Situations awarded Belgorod the first prize in its all-Russian competition for “a city without dangers”. ■\nTo stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Café Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

Unless the apartments are re-registered with the Russian occupying authorities and people are living in them, the properties will soon be declared ownerless and sold.\nPetro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol municipal authority in exile, says he knows his apartment has been broken into and his possessions stolen. Like many of the other roughly 350,000 Mariupolans from a pre-war population of 430,000 who have fled, he cannot risk going back to re-register his flat in person. He expects someone else will soon be living there. “It’s a normal story,” he says.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\nIn May the website of the housing ministry of the Donetsk National Republic (dnr), the separatist statelet overseen by Russia since 2014, listed 514 ownerless apartments in Mariupol, complete with addresses and square footage. Re-registration is being done throughout the occupied territories to consolidate Russian control and also as a new phase of economic exploitation. It is especially venal in Mariupol, where Russia’s authorities are creating a new real-estate market in a city largely ruined by their bombs.\nEstimates suggest that over 90% of the housing blocks in central Mariupol were damaged in the invasion of 2022. Some have been repaired, others demolished. Some Mariupolans have been given flats in shoddy newly built blocks. Leo, who doesn’t want to use his real name, says his parents’ new apartment has wobbly door handles and a mouldy balcony, windows won’t close properly and the bathroom fixtures had to be replaced after a month. New commercial buildings have priority over social housing, though developers are putting up residential blocks with big government grants and loans. Russia’s government offers a cheap mortgage rate of just 2% to buyers in the occupied territories, so local agents are touting for business.\nA promotional video shows a young female agent walking through wrecked Mariupol apartments with an upbeat pitch: “Investment is arriving from Russian regions.” Mariupol, she assures, offers a valuable investment. She shows a buyer around a damaged three-room flat, noting the “chic layout” and the size of the children’s bedroom, where abandoned toys are strewn about. “We see the owners left in a hurry,” she says. Mr Andryushchenko reckons some 80,000 Mariupolans now live in the city alongside the same number of incomers, almost all from Russia. As bombed-out neighbourhoods are razed and new buildings go up, Mariupolans have been pushed out of the city centre. Compensation for demolished apartments is derisory.\nSome Mariupolans who fled to Ukrainian-held territory or Europe are now trying to go back, to get a Russian passport, re-register their property and sell it—if they can. But Ukrainian passport-holders must go through a filtration point at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport to be asked why they are going there and what is their view of the “special operation” in Ukraine. Plenty of Mariupolans have apparently been denied entry.\nTo get around the new rules, some have tried to transfer ownership (often to relatives still in Mariupol) by getting documents notarised by Russian embassies abroad. But the overlapping jurisdictions of the dnr and the Russian Federation in Mariupol can snarl up the regulations.\nUltimately, says Mr Andryushchenko, “it doesn’t matter” that Russians are buying confiscated Ukrainian property. Under international and Ukrainian law, such transactions are “absolutely illegal”. If at some future date Mariupol is returned to Ukrainian control, any contract disputed by an owner citing Ukrainian records would be null and void. “Unofficially, our recommendation as a Ukrainian municipal authority is: if you can sell your property, do it,” he says. And what of Mariupolans who have bought flats in new blocks with Russian mortgages, or have bought properties illegally but unknowingly?\nMr Andryushchenko thinks such questions are moot. “We don’t know what kind of condition Mariupol will be in after de-occupation,” he points out. “It could be absolutely destroyed again.” ■\nTo stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Café Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

The approval in April of the Biden administration’s $61bn military-support package, after six months of Congressional delay, is having an impact. In particular, the arrival of atacms ballistic missiles, with a range of 300km, means that Ukraine can now hit any target in Russian-occupied Crimea, with deadly effect.\nIn the past two weeks the Russian offensive in the north-east on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, also appears to have lost momentum. Of potentially even greater significance, on May 30th President Joe Biden, under pressure from a growing chorus of European allies, eased the restrictions on American weapons being used against military targets on Russian soil, imposed because of fears of Russian nuclear escalation. The Ukrainians are now to be allowed to use some American kit to hit Russian forces on the other side of the border as they prepare to attack Kharkiv. It is not clear whether this includes Russian tactical aircraft launching glide-bomb attacks like the one that killed at least 18 people in a Kharkiv hardware shop on May 25th.\nRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\nHowever, to Ukrainian exasperation, Mr Biden has still to lift his ban on hitting targets elsewhere in Russia. The effectiveness of Ukraine’s campaign in Crimea shows what can be done. According to Ben Hodges, a former commander of American forces in Europe and a senior adviser to nato on logistics, the Ukrainians are “systematically in the process of making Crimea uninhabitable for Russian forces”.\nThat would be a huge prize for Ukraine. Since the reign of Catherine the Great, Russians have regarded Crimea as a military jewel. Vladimir Putin saw Crimea, linked to the Russian mainland by the Kerch Bridge since 2018, as an unsinkable aircraft-carrier. Its logistics hubs, air bases and the Black Sea Fleet, operating out of Sevastopol, could be used to dominate the south of Ukraine, close off its vital grain exports, and provide a steady flow of men and materiel to push Ukraine out of areas to the north. Mr Putin has invested huge sums in military infrastructure in Crimea, all of it now under threat.\nA D-Day-style amphibious assault to liberate Crimea remains inconceivable. But, says Sir Lawrence Freedman, a British strategist, that is the wrong way to look at it. Crimea is now a weak point for Russia, which has too much there to defend. It provides the best way for Ukraine to put real pressure on Mr Putin in order to extract concessions in the future. Nico Lange, a former adviser to the German defence ministry, agrees: “Ukraine’s campaign is a mixture of a military and political strategy. Politically, [Crimea] is Russia’s most vital asset; but it is also very vulnerable.” What Ukraine is attempting to do is to make it a liability rather than an asset for Mr Putin. The aim is to isolate it, push Russian air and sea forces away from southern Ukraine and strangle it as a logistics hub.\nmap: the economist\nUkraine has already demonstrated the ability of British- and French-supplied Storm Shadow and scalp cruise missiles and its own cleverly designed homemade maritime drones to hit Russian warships, particularly the big Ropucha landing vessels used as military transports, most of which have been destroyed. Ukrainian drones and missiles may have taken out of action as much as half of the once formidable Black Sea Fleet. Almost all of the remainder has been forced to relocate to the port of Novorossiysk, over 300km away on the Russian mainland. Novorossiysk itself came under attack from both marine and aerial drones on May 17th. A railway station and a power-generation plant as well as the naval base were hit.\nBut now Ukraine is using a deadly combination of atacms and increasingly sophisticated drones to systematically bash Russian air defences in Crimea, hit air bases and strike logistical and economic targets. Sir Lawrence says crippling Russia’s air-defence network should help Ukraine prepare for the imminent arrival of the first batches of f-16 fighter jets from Europe.\nOn April 17th an atacms strike on Dzhankoi air base in north-eastern Crimea damaged helicopters, an s-400 battery and a command-and-control centre. On May 15th a large-scale atacms strike on an air base at Belbek near Sevastopol destroyed four planes and an s-400 air-defence radar. Ten missiles each carrying 300 bomblets caused massive fires, possibly set off by an exploding fuel depot.\nBelbek was hit again the next day, showing that Ukraine has rather more than the 100 or so atacms thought to have been donated. In what is becoming almost a nightly occurrence two Russian patrol boats were destroyed on May 30th and two transport ferries were damaged near the Kerch Bridge in separate drone strikes.\nWoe to the Kremlin\nRussia’s much-vaunted and very expensive s-400 air-defence system has been found wanting. Mr Lange says the Ukrainians are using decoy drones to make the Russians light up their radars and reveal their positions. The targeting data are immediately fed to the atacms launch crews. Within six minutes the missiles, virtually undetectable because of their speed and low radar cross-section, are hitting their targets. General Hodges notes that Russia’s s-400s are also vulnerable to sabotage by Ukrainian special forces operating inside Crimea. Each battery costs about $200m, and they are not easily replaceable.\nThe general says that Russian forces have “no place to hide”. With the help of satellite and aerial reconnaissance provided by nato allies, their own deep knowledge of the territory, and covert forces on the ground, nothing can move in Crimea without the Ukrainians knowing about it. With the arrival of the atacms and the increasing sophistication of Ukraine’s own drones, every square metre of the peninsula is in range, including aircraft and equipment convoys moving by road or rail.\nGeneral Hodges is confident the Ukrainians will “take down the Kerch Bridge when they are ready”. But it may be more challenging to disrupt the new improved railway line running along the Sea of Azov from Rostov, through the occupied Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Berdiansk and down into Crimea. Dmitry Pletenchuk, a spokesman for Ukraine’s southern military command, says: “The railway along the land corridor is recognition on the part of the Russian occupiers that the Crimean [Kerch] Bridge is doomed. They are looking for a way to hedge their bets because they are aware that sooner or later, they will have a problem.”\nAn early test of the wider strategic success of Ukraine’s campaign in Crimea could come in summer, when Russian holidaymakers normally flock across the Kerch Bridge to resorts on the peninsula. If they decide otherwise, says Ben Barry of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think-tank, it will be a bad omen for Mr Putin. Crimea used to depend heavily on the tourist industry. Bookings last year were down by nearly a half. “Crimea”, says Mr Barry, “has been turned from being a prestige project to a drain on Russian resources.” ■\nTo stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Café Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

On one block is a fertility clinic, an increasingly common sight in a country obsessed by its shortage of babies. A block further down is a day centre for pensioners, advertising services like memory training and help with mobility. It is common to see women in their 60s gently leading their 90-something mothers up to the door.\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington recently issued projections for longevity by country in 2050. Among the top 20 for living to a ripe old age are rich ones like Switzerland and Singapore. East Asia is also represented by South Korea and Japan, longtime longevity leaders.\nchart: the economist\nBut a geographic cluster of relatively poorer countries are also conducive to longer lives: Spain, Italy, France and Portugal. (Three nearby microstates, San Marino, Malta and Andorra, make the top 20, too.) The oldest person alive is a Spanish woman, Maria Branyas Morera (117), who succeeded a French one. Health and long life correlate unsurprisingly with gdp per capita. Why does southern Europe outperform the usual link between wealth and health, making the average lifespan in Spain (85.5 years in 2050) longer than that of the average Dane (83.5)?\nMany point to the “Mediterranean diet”—fish, whole grains, fresh fruit, vegetables and olive oil. Critics, though, point out that diets differ widely from Portugal to Greece. Besides, researchers find that today’s Mediterraneans do not stick to their namesake diet. Plazas in Spain are full of people eating fried fish and salted ham, washed down with beer at hours some might consider unseemly. Spaniards drink more booze and smoke slightly more than the European average, and are among Europe’s biggest cocaine users.\nDan Buettner, who has written several books on areas where people live long, notes that to understand why people grow old one must look not at today’s habits but at those of half a century ago, when people ate “peasant food”, dominated by grains, beans and tubers. A recent study of the “blue zone” (a designation for areas that feature many centenarians) in Sardinia found that the diet included “famine foods”, such as bread made from acorns and clay and a cheese made with insect larvae. The most notable fish product was salted, dried mullet ovaries; inland shepherds rarely ate fresh fish. Diets today increasingly include Western processed foods, but “cultural inertia” keeps them somewhat healthier, says Mr Buettner.\nThat shepherding past points to another factor: movement. Spaniards lead western Europe in steps per day at 5,936, according to a study from 2017. (Italy, France and Portugal are less impressive.) The study found that countries with “activity inequality”—a few prolific walkers but many couch potatoes, as in America and Saudi Arabia—had the highest obesity rates. Those where everyone moved a reasonable amount, as in Spain, had low ones. That evidently reduced mortality from obesity-related diseases.\nFour of the world’s most walkable cities are in Spain. See our full ranking of the world’s most, and least, active cities.\nWhy do Spaniards move so much? Spanish cities, and even tiny pueblos, are densely populated; hit the city limits and you are often in empty countryside. Neither culture nor regulation favour sprawling suburbs, so even with abundant land, Spaniards live on top of each other. Paris and other places aiming to create “15-minute cities”, where most necessities are within walking radius, could learn much from Spain. The same study that looked at “activity inequality” examined urban America, finding that dense cities like New York and Boston had greater (and more evenly distributed) levels of activity than sprawling places like Atlanta and Phoenix.\nBut stressing diet and exercise misses a piece of the puzzle. Spain’s walkability is also good for social life. Cities are built around plazas where friends, family and co-workers sit, eat, drink and talk. That turns out to be good for you even if you sip vermouth and eat crisps at noon. Reams of research show that social contact is critical for physical and psychological well-being.\nAccording to a recent survey by Gallup, a pollster, and Meta, a social-media company, 76% of Spaniards say they feel “very” or “fairly” socially supported. That is above average, though not top of the table. Jon Clifton, head of Gallup, says his firm’s research shows that Spaniards are fairly unhappy and disengaged at work. He quips that a headline in El País, a newspaper, got it more or less right: Spain is “the best country to live in and the worst to work in”.\nchart: the economist\nBut work is not everything. Spaniards are fourth in the world when asked whether they have seen friends or family who live near or with them in the past week (Greece was second). This may be the unexpected upside of the fact that many young southern Europeans cannot get good enough jobs to afford to move out of their parents’ homes. Family bonds remain tight, including in trying times like the financial crisis and the pandemic.\nSouthern European countries do not score highest on happiness—that title has long been held by Denmark and Finland. But happiness assessments weight long-term life satisfaction more heavily than short-term smiling and laughing. Those sorts of gleeful emotions are reported most often by Latin Americans. And, metaphorically and physically, a line drawn from Helsinki to Buenos Aires would pass through Spain. That country has European levels of wealth (the best predictor of happiness) and health care (which keeps people alive), while also sharing cultural traits with Latin Americans: living for the moment and treasuring friendships and families. These are not just good in themselves. They keep you going, too. ■\nTo stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Café Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

        "body": "“I\nhave an onion on my head/I am a kebab/because kebab makes you more beautiful.” It is no surprise that the lyrics of “Döner macht schöner”, a German hit from 2004, do not deliver quite the same emotional payload in English. In Britain the doner kebab is a byword for drunken excess, devoured before bed and recalled in shame. In Germany, especially its capital, it is a more exalted affair. Every Berliner has a favoured Dönerladen. Many build family outings around them.\nThe döner kebab (the umlaut is essential) long ago displaced currywurst as Berliners’ fast food of choice. But these days its ubiquity obliges it to carry a lot more than succulent strips of seasoned meat—lamb, veal or beef—served in flatbread with salad and sauces.\nTake inflation: where frugal Germans once assessed price rises via the cost of ice cream or beer, today newspapers calculate how many kebabs an hour’s labour might earn you. After supply-chain shocks and war sent prices soaring, some politicians called for a dönerpreisbremse: a cap on the cost of kebabs. “Talk to Putin, I want to pay four euros for a kebab!” one döner-demonstrator shouted at the chancellor in 2022.\nDon’t laugh: Döner-Diplomatie is a thing. In April Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany’s president, was skewered for inviting a Berlin kebab-shop owner, complete with a 60kg slab of meat, to join him on a state visit to Turkey. Might a better symbol of German-Turkish amity, sniffed columnists, not have been Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci, the Mainz-based couple behind the first mrna covid vaccine? Nonsense, says Eberhard Seidel, author of “Döner: A Turkish-German Cultural History”, who snagged an invite on the president’s plane. The kebab was served to Turks at a reception in Istanbul, while Germans feasted on plates of garlic sausage with a side of sauerkraut. What better way to celebrate the humble roots of the migrants upon whom the relationship between these two countries rests?\nMr Seidel places the origins of the döner in the Ottoman empire. (The vertical-roasting technique was probably invented in Bursa, in north-west Turkey.) In the 1970s some Turkish Gastarbeiter (guest workers) in West Germany were forced to open kebab stands after the factories and mines they had migrated to work in were closed. They adapted the döner to German tastes and concocted the trio of sauces that any self-respecting stand must offer—herb, garlic and scharf (spicy)—and, crucially, serving it in bread. This cheap, portable dish spread across Germany quickly.\nMore recent migrants have taken the döner in new directions. At Rüyam Kebab, in Berlin’s Schöneberg district, your correspondent is served a gemüse (vegetable) döner as big as his head. The staff, largely Arabs rather than Turks, have added carrots and aubergine to the usual salad. The resulting array of lushly coloured, carefully layered ingredients is not just delicious but (perhaps not coincidentally) perfect for Instagram. It is not yet 6pm, and the queue extends out of the door. ■",

Ask Openai’s dall-e 3, or its counterparts Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, to draw a penguin sipping on a vodka martini on the French Riviera and they will do so with aplomb. Ask them to replicate it in the style of Rembrandt or Caravaggio and they will speedily oblige.\nThese abilities all depend on a family of physics-inspired algorithms known as diffusion models. For now, they reign supreme. But that may not always be the case. A team of physicists and computer scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (mit) has been taking inspiration from the laws of nature to come up with a series of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that can generate higher-quality images faster, and with smaller training data sets, than diffusion models.\nDiffusion models mimic the maths of the physical process of diffusion, the flow of particles from areas of high to low concentration as they are randomly jostled about in space. The mit team’s more advanced algorithms make use, instead, of the equations of electromagnetism—and may one day even use the mathematics that govern the forces at play in the atomic nucleus. This work suggests that computer scientists have barely scratched the surface of how generative algorithms can work. A new school of ai art is emerging.\nThe goal of a good generative algorithm is, ultimately, to create bespoke images from scratch. One growing class of models, to which dall-e 3 and its counterparts belong, does this by taking vast data sets of training images and distorting them, pixel by pixel, until they are indistinguishable from visual static. As the patterns underlying these distortions are identified, the algorithm can run combinations of them in reverse, allowing entirely new images to be born out of nothing more than background noise.\nThis means that mathematical ways of inducing distortion are in high demand. Enter diffusion. Imagine, for simplicity’s sake, a monochrome picture consisting of a single pixel. To a computer scientist, that picture can be represented by a point on a single axis running from white to black. Or, in other words, as a point in one-dimensional space. For every pixel that is added to the picture, the number of dimensions increases by one—and the picture is now represented by a point in multidimensional space. If random noise is added to that point (by changing the colour of the image’s constituent pixels), it will then move randomly in its multidimensional space—a process mathematically identical to that of a particle undergoing diffusion.\nThe fact that mimicking such simple physical processes has had such profound computational benefits caught the attention of Max Tegmark and Tommi Jaakkola, two physicists at mit, and their graduate students, Yilun Xu and Ziming Liu, in 2022. Together, they set out to explore whether models trained on more complex processes might do an even better job of image generation. They started by toying with the physics of electrically charged particles. Unlike in standard diffusion, the journeys of charged particles are not truly random. Repelled and attracted by their neighbours, they are governed instead by the electric field in which they exist.\nIt’s electrifying\nThis behaviour can be emulated in the way that noise is added to a digital image. Recall that images can be represented as points in a multidimensional space defined by the colours of each pixel. If these points are treated like particles with identical electric charge, they ought to repel one another, moving in opposite directions until the system reaches electrostatic equilibrium. Or, in other words, each image will change in response to every other image until all have been sufficiently distorted.\nIt turns out that a machine-learning model trained to reverse this process can have considerable advantages. This is because the distorting noise is not merely random, as in diffusion models, but carries additional information about the training data. That makes for a more efficient algorithm. Mr Xu, Mr Liu and their colleagues then published a preprint outlining this new class of models. They called them “Poisson flow generative models” (pfgms), named for Poisson’s equation, which describes the electric field created by static electrical charges. Judged by industry standards, pfgms generate images of equal or better quality than state-of-the-art diffusion models, while being less error-prone and requiring between ten and 20 times fewer computational steps.\nThe researchers were not done yet. They also turned their attention to Coulomb’s law, the equation that governs the strength of the electric field which exists between two charges (and from which Poisson’s equation can be derived). The researchers found that changing the number of dimensions in which Coulomb’s law operates has implications for a pfgm’s behaviour. Fewer dimensions result in models that require more data to train but that need fewer parameters, make fewer errors and produce more consistent images. More dimensions result in models that require less data to train but are bulkier, more error-prone and less consistent.\nIn a subsequent preprint, the team called this broader family of electrostatic models pfgm++. They also made a surprising discovery. When the number of dimensions in the equations is taken to infinity, the distortion algorithm behaves like a standard diffusion model. This means that pfgm++ folds all the current physics-inspired generative models into one family.\nStill more complex distortion mechanisms beckon. The next target for Messrs Xu and Liu is the weak interaction, which, alongside electromagnetism, gravity and the strong interaction, is a fundamental force of nature. (Imperceptible at human scales, it is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay.) Conveniently, its equations are almost identical to those used in the pfgm++ family of models.\nThe weak force, however, has special properties that the electromagnetic force does not. For one thing, it does not need to conserve the number of particles. Pairs of particles can mutually annihilate, and new ones can pop into being. If this physics is translated into an algorithm, it may unlock new behaviour: compressing data with record efficiency, for example, or offering applications in cell biology where objects multiply or die out. How well it can draw a penguin, though, remains to be seen. ■\nCurious about the world?

June 20th marks the 50th anniversary of the release of “Chinatown”, the film truest to the Los Angeles of the countless noirs set in America’s second-most-populous city. Other films revolve around Hollywood—or at least its dark, gritty edges—where every millionaire, wannabe actor and insurance agent has a secret worth killing for. But Gittes was fixated on water, or the lack thereof, a perennial problem in a city that is otherwise constantly changing.\nFilm noir was so named by French critics after the second world war. It is a style of film-making that often features a cynical anti-hero who either sleuths for a living or finds himself accidentally drawn into an investigation. Think of Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe in “The Big Sleep” (1946), a film based on Raymond Chandler’s novel. Or of Barton Keyes, an insurance claims investigator, hellbent on sniffing out fraud in “Double Indemnity” (1944). There is a good chance that crooked cops, cover-ups, pretty blondes and business tycoons will turn up at some point in the story. The closest thing to a happy ending is that not everyone will end up dead.\nphotograph: getty images\n“Chinatown” was released several decades after the genre’s heyday in the 1940s-50s. The film, and the “neo noirs” that followed it, tried to strike a balance between paying homage to the classics and turning the genre on its head. In 1982 “Blade Runner” transported viewers to the futuristic Los Angeles of 2019. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) searches for bioengineered humans who are not supposed to be on Earth, let alone in the City of Angels.\nCrime flicks can be made about any city. But Los Angeles cornered the market back when Chandler was writing screenplays. Many great crime novelists have lived there, including Chandler and, later, James Ellroy. But their novels need not be adapted faithfully. “Double Indemnity”, after all, was based on a murder in Queens.\nWhy does Los Angeles continue to play a leading role in film noir? Its status as America’s long-reigning film capital is part of it. The city also lends itself to film noir because it is such a study in contrasts. The relentless sunshine and skinny palm trees jar with the genre’s violence and corruption. la is where people come to make it, and only a few succeed.\nphotograph: allstar\nWhat happens to those who are disappointed? Wannabe starlets become call girls. Men who cannot pay their mortgage become muscle for mobsters. Danny DeVito, who plays a smarmy tabloid journalist in the neo-noir “la Confidential” (1997), based on a novel by Mr Ellroy, gives an oleaginous monologue that encapsulates the duality of la noir. “You’d think this place was the garden of Eden,” he says, “but there’s trouble in paradise.”\nA newer spate of la noirs fetishise the genre even while challenging its conventions. In the television series “Lucifer”, the lord of Hell solves murders alongside a city detective. There are sometimes musical numbers to offset all the killing. In “Sugar”, which premiered on Apple tv in April, John Sugar, a private investigator, is a cinephile. He wears a suit and drives an old Corvette in the mould of Marlowe or Gittes. A girl goes missing, and as Sugar investigates, he finds each member of her family to be corrupt in their own way. Sugar, too, loses sight of himself the more he obsesses over the case. The series even begins in black and white and features old film clips throughout.\nphotograph: apple tv\nBut unlike the classics, Mr Sugar is no sarcastic anti-hero. In fact, he is nice. He does not sneer, antagonise police or hit women. He does not like guns. He helps the homeless and even adopts a dog. It is a far cry from the blood-soaked impunity of “la Confidential”, in which almost everyone is unlikeable and gets shot. He solves his case and saves the girl.\nGittes is not so lucky. His efforts, like many a private investigator in film noir, prove futile. “Forget it, Jake,” his partner says when the woman he wants to protect is killed. “It’s Chinatown.” ■\nFor more on the latest books, films, tv shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter",

        "body": "I\nn a speech to the Vatican in January, Pope Francis made an observation fit for an economist. He argued that declining fertility rates might lead to a “demographic winter”. In every European country the total fertility rate, the expected number of children a woman will have in her lifetime, has now fallen below 2.1, the level needed to maintain a stable population without immigration. The same is true in many developing countries, including China and (as of this year) India. This, the pope warned, would weigh on the world’s economic health.\nListen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\nYour browser does not support the <audio> element.\nEconomists have long considered such a slowdown inevitable. In the best-known model of fertility, popularised by Gary Becker, a Nobel-prizewinning economist, and others in the 1960s, there is a central role for the trade-off between the “quantity and quality” of children. As countries grow richer and the returns to education rise, it is expected that families will invest more in a smaller number of children. And as women’s working options expand, the opportunity cost of their time will grow, making the trade-off between family and career more difficult.\nFitting this theory, many places have already gone through a “demographic transition”, in which poor, high-fertility countries become rich, low-fertility ones. In some, the transition has been so dramatic that their populations have started to decline. The number of people in Japan has fallen by about 3m since peaking at 128m in 2008. Many demographers suspect China’s population is also falling, no matter what the country’s official figures claim.\nYet an emerging body of research suggests that fertility may go through another shift at a later stage of development. A recent review of the literature by Matthias Doepke of Northwestern University and co-authors makes the case that, in rich countries, fertility may rise, or at least fall at a slower rate, if norms, policies and the market for child care make it easier for a woman to have children and a career. In countries with, say, supportive family policy or fathers who take on a greater share of child-care duties, one would expect working women to have more children than in the past.\nOne way to see if this is true is to compare fertility rates across countries with differing incomes and female labour-force participation. In 1980 countries in the oecd with higher female participation rates had lower rates of fertility. By 2000 that relationship had flipped: countries with higher rates of female labour-force participation had higher rates of fertility. Since then, the picture has muddied slightly. By 2019 the new relationship had weakened a little, and it looks less sturdy when considering gdp per person rather than labour-force participation\nBut when looked at within countries, the new pattern of fertility becomes clearer. A paper published in 2018 by Michael Bar of San Francisco State University and co-authors shows that in America the relationship between education and fertility, which used to be a downward-sloping trend, has turned into something of a reversed-tick mark. Women with advanced degrees have slightly more children than college graduates. A similar pattern holds when looking at income. The authors argue that the growing availability of child care has reduced the difficulty of the trade-off between family and work.\nGovernments are also trying to change the picture. Last year South Korea’s fertility rate dropped to 0.81, a record low. In 2019, family-leave policy changed to allow parents with young children to take an additional year of reduced hours on top of an already generous year off work. The share of South Korean parents who take leave has doubled in the past decade, from 12% to 24%. Meanwhile, Hungary has exempted mothers of four or more children from income taxes for life—a more controversial approach, especially since Viktor Orban, the country’s prime minister, has justified it as a way to boost the population without allowing immigration to rise. A report published by the un last year found that the share of countries with pro-natalist policies had grown from 20% in 2005 to 28% in 2019.\nNot all interventions are equally effective. Work by Janna Bergsvik of Statistics Norway, an official research outfit, and colleagues, finds that, although some measures (including subsidised child care) make a difference, others (including parental leave) accomplish far less. Mr Doepke says the biggest boost to fertility occurs when interventions match the way that societies operate. The provision of child care will make little difference if social norms push women to stay at home to look after children. But in Denmark, where fathers take on more child-care responsibilities than in other rich countries, the provision of state-subsidised care for children made a big difference. The country’s fertility rate rose from 1.38 in 1983 to 1.72 in 2021.\nFlush of youth\nThere is a lot riding on the new fertility switch lasting. The share of the population in the oecd aged 65 and over is expected to have passed 50% by 2050, about 20 points higher than today. As rich countries grow old, there will be greater demand for carers, which will make it more expensive to hire child care. Without a productivity revolution, perhaps featuring robot nannies, child care will remain a privilege of the rich in places without state-funded provision. It is also unclear if norms that make the family-career trade-off easier will continue to spread.\nYet the worse the problem becomes, the harder governments will work to combat it. And as they experiment, evidence will build about which responses are the most effective. The covid-19 pandemic may also end up helping. It delayed many families’ decisions about whether to have children, but in time it may turn out to have had a more positive impact. The rise of working-from-home should make working with children easier. In his speech the pope lamented those people who chose to look after pets instead of children. Maybe that trade-off will lessen, too. ■\nRead more from Free Exchange, our column on economics:\nEurope’s energy market was not built for this crisis (Sep 8th)\nCentral bankers worry that a new era of high inflation is beginning (Sep 1st)\nHow to avoid energy rationing (Aug 27th)\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly newsletter.",

        "body": "A\nlthough it is beginning to recover, Iraq is still suffering from the wars of the past decades. In 2023 about 45 people a month died violently, according to Iraq Body Count, a Britain-based monitor. This is much lower than the toll at the height of the civil war that followed the American-led invasion of the country in 2003. In the fighting between Shia Muslims, who make up the majority of Iraq’s population, and Sunnis, who until then had ruled the country, the number of violent deaths averaged 80 a day. That trauma is evident in much of Iraq’s recent literature. Corpses have a leading role in the three Iraqi novels we recommend below. Yet the country is also heir to a great cultural legacy. Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is where the first cities appeared some 5,000 years ago, which is why modern-day Iraq is popularly regarded as the “cradle of civilisation”. Here are five books that explain the country’s origins and its recent history.\nThe Corpse Washer. By Sinan Antoon. Yale University Press; 200 pages; $13.95 and £10.99\nJawad, a young man from a Shia family, first encountered death in his father’s office. Like generations of men before him, Jawad’s father was a mghassilchi, a corpse washer. As a child in the 1970s Jawad learned how to perform the ritual washing and shrouding that comes before the finality of burial. But the young Jawad also loves drawing the world of the living and grows up to become a sculptor. When war comes in 2003 he, like many artists, has to abandon his profession. Upon his father’s death soon after that Jawad becomes a mghassilchi. But this time the bodies come mangled by war. Sometimes they are “too mutilated, burned, or swollen” to be washed. Over the decades covered by Sinan Antoon’s novel, published in Arabic in 2010, one thing does not change: Jawad, though surrounded by death, strives to create life from art. He finds a way to reconcile the two: “I had thought that life and death were two separate worlds with clearly marked boundaries. But now I know they are conjoined, sculpting each other.”\nBaghdad: City of Peace, City of Blood. By Justin Marozzi. Da Capo; 536 pages; $32. Penguin; £16.99\nThe recent history of Baghdad, Iraq’s capital, is blotted with blood. But so is its more distant past. Justin Marozzi’s riveting account of Baghdad begins with its founding in 762 by Mansur, the second Abbasid caliph, whose empire stretched from India to the Atlantic. He sailed up and down the Tigris looking for a spot to found a capital. He called what is now Baghdad the “City of Peace”. It would be, he prophesied, “the crossroads of the Universe”. He was right: for half a millennium it was the greatest city in the world. In the centuries that followed, it had periods of prosperity, when its storytellers and scholars were famous, interrupted by episodes of terrible mayhem. “Baghdadis”, Mr Marozzi writes, “have been tremendously talented in creating beauty and culture and, tragically, just as skilled in destroying them”. Mr Marozzi’s tale ends with the modern day: he interviews many Bagdhadis, including Ahmed Chalabi, a Shia politician who, as our review of the book put it, “egged the Americans on to invade in 2003 and then turned on them with a guile that would have been familiar to his forebears”. As the book ends Baghdad is once again at war, yearning to be a city of peace.\nThe President’s Gardens. By Muhsin al-Ramli. Translated by Luke Leafgren. MacLehose Press; 352 pages; $16.99 and £8.99\nWhen Isma’il, a herdsman, notices nine banana crates by the side of the road on the third day of Ramadan in 2006, he is puzzled. Because of a un embargo, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, bananas were seldom seen in Iraq. But the crates do not contain bananas. Each holds a human head. “The President’s Gardens”, a novel, is the story of one of those murdered Iraqis, Ibrahim “the fated”, and his friendship with two other men: Tariq “the befuddled” and Abdullah, known as “Kafka” for the “firmly rooted sadness…in his eyes”. The three men grow up together but their lives diverge. Abdullah and Ibrahim are drafted to fight in the Iraq-Iran war of 1980-88; Tariq stays home, and becomes a religious leader. When Ibrahim leaves the armed forces he finds work in the unnamed president’s gardens, where he encounters a leader who is both capricious and cruel. Ibrahim decides to resist his regime. This leads to his beheading—and to the reunion of his friends in their grief. Mr Ramli’s novel is partly based on his own story: Saddam Hussein, the dictator that America overthrew, executed his brother, Hassan Mutlak, in 1990.\nTo Start a War: How the Bush Administration Took America Into Iraq. By Robert Draper. Penguin; 496 pages; £19 and $19\nRobert Draper has spent many hours with George Bush the younger, the American president whose “war on terror” culminated in the invasion of Iraq. Mr Bush gave Mr Draper six hour-long interviews for a previous book, “Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. Bush”, published in 2007. “To Start a War”, which appeared in 2020, has a more insiderish feel. His account of the decisions that led to the invasion draws from interviews with other decision-makers, including Paul Wolfowitz, then number two at the Pentagon, and Colin Powell, the secretary of state. Mr Draper writes about imagined threats and the conversations in which officials of the Bush administration convinced themselves that going to war was the right thing to do. Mr Bush, Mr Draper suggests, was the most dogmatic of them all, believing with real fervour in the evil of Saddam Hussein and in the need for the “liberation” of Iraq and its people. A scene towards the end of the book epitomises his naivety. On a day in late April 2003 Mr Bush and Mr Powell watched from the Oval Office as American and British troops entered Basra, Iraq’s second-largest city. Surrounded by tanks and helicopters, the people stared blankly at the cameras. Mr Bush the liberator turned to Mr Powell and asked, “Why aren’t they cheering?”\nFrankenstein in Baghdad. By Ahmed Saadawi. Translated by Jonathan Wright. Penguin; 288 pages; $18. Oneworld; £9.99\nAhmed Saadawi’s novel begins as American troops are occupying Iraq. Violence has become a norm. Bombs are frequent—as is death. Hadi, a junk collector, searches for body parts in Baghdad’s wreckage, hoping to assemble them into one complete body and give it a proper burial. But something strange happens: just as Hadi completes his project a bomb nearby kills Hasib, a guard, whose soul enters the haphazard body that Hadi has put together. Thus is born the “Frankenstein of Baghdad”. What follows is dark, surreal and surprisingly funny. The new creature, called “Whatsitsname” by his maker, wants to avenge the people who compose his body. And so he does, in a killing spree described in graphic detail by Mr Saadawi.

The bird’s nest soup was gentle and slithery, the sea cucumber rich and gelatinous and the fish sparklingly fresh and perfectly steamed. The most memorable dish, however, was the plain white cup of broth served at the end. Made from chicken, probably with ham and dried scallop as well, it was simple, austere and perfect.\nEnding a banquet with soup may seem odd to Westerners, accustomed as they are to sweets at a meal’s close. But, as Fuchsia Dunlop, an English food writer, explains in an authoritative new book, stock is a unique, intrinsic expression of a chef’s art, much as a voice is for a singer. And the “transparent, almost invisible soup…in its quiet golden, ineffable loveliness” is an ideal conclusion to a banquet, with its opulence and strong flavours.\n“Invitation to a Banquet” is Ms Dunlop’s seventh book. Unlike those for which she is best known, including “The Food of Sichuan” and “Revolutionary Kitchen” (about Hunanese cuisine), this is not a cookbook. Instead, she has chosen 30 dishes and used each to illuminate different aspects of Chinese cuisine—and, in turn, Chinese life and history.\nThis is less of a departure for Ms Dunlop than it seems. Like other outsiders who spend their lives focused on a foreign cuisine—as Diana Kennedy, an English food writer, did in Mexico, or Paula Wolfert, an American, did in the Middle East—she is more a gatherer than an inventor of recipes. Ms Dunlop’s well-researched cookbooks read as mini-ethnographies.\nReaders will not learn how to make braised pomelo pith with shrimp eggs but how and why Chinese chefs have long prized unusual (and to Western palates, sometimes off-putting) ingredients, such as the bitter pith of a giant citrus fruit. An apparently humble, but in fact exceptionally laborious, dish of braised carp’s tail is a jumping-off point for a discussion of the importance of kougan, or mouth-feel, in Chinese cuisine.\nWesterners, Ms Dunlop argues, “have traditionally assumed that the Chinese eat marginal animal parts out of poverty and desperation”, when in fact turning up one’s nose at gizzards, cartilage and jellyfish shuts the door on a range of foods that is wonderfully cui (“slippery and crunchy, often in a wet way”).\nIn aggregate, Ms Dunlop makes a compelling case for the superiority of Chinese cuisine, but in a delighted and expansive rather than chauvinistic way. She shows how it has assimilated foreign influences (as other cuisines have, too), how it has changed with China’s increasing wealth and how central it is to the country’s intellectual and cultural history.\nShe makes an equally compelling case that what Westerners think of as “Chinese food”, meaning what most can find at their local takeaway, is neither inauthentic nor wrong. Instead, it is a diasporic offshoot that reflects local tastes but is about as representative of the cuisine’s diversity as a frozen pizza is of Italy’s. Immigration and adventurousness have made the real thing more accessible than ever outside China. Eaters should savour that. ■",

In that same period the cost of another meaty treat—a hot-dog-and-drink combo at Costco—has remained steady at $1.50. Last year customers of the American big-box retailer devoured 200m of them. Richard Galanti, Costco’s longtime finance boss, once promised to keep the price frozen “for ever”.\nCustomers are not the only fans of Costco, as the outpouring of affection from Wall Street analysts after Mr Galanti announced his retirement on February 6th made clear. The firm’s share price is 430 times what it was when he took the job nearly four decades ago, compared with 25 times for the s&p 500 index of large companies. It has continued to outperform the market in recent years. What lies behind its enduring success?\nCostco is the world’s third-biggest retailer, behind Walmart and Amazon. Though its sales are less than half of Walmart’s, its return on capital, at nearly 20%, is more than twice as high. Charlie Munger, a famed investor who served on Costco’s board from 1997 until his death last year, called it a “perfect damn company”. Mr Galanti, who describes Costco’s business model as “arrogantly simple”, says the company is guided by a simple idea—hook shoppers by offering high-quality products at the lowest prices. It does this by keeping markups low while charging a fixed membership fee and stocking fewer distinct products, all while treating its employees generously.\nStart with margins. Most retailers boost profits by marking up prices. Not Costco. Its gross margins hover around 12%, compared with Walmart’s 24%. The company makes up the shortfall through its membership fees: customers pay $60 or more a year to shop at its stores. In 2023 fees from its 129m members netted $4.6bn, more than half of Costco’s operating profits.\nJoe Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, a research firm, argues that the membership model creates a virtuous circle. The more members the company has, the greater its buying power, leading to better deals with suppliers, most of which are then passed on to its members. The fee also encourages customers to focus their spending at Costco, rather than shopping around. That seems to work; membership-renewal rates are upwards of 90%.\nNext, consider the way the company manages its product lineup. Costco stores stock a limited selection of about 3,800 distinct items. Sam’s Club, Walmart’s Costco-like competitor, carries about 7,000. A Walmart superstore has around 120,000. Buying more from fewer suppliers gives the company even greater bargaining heft, lowering prices further. By limiting its range, Costco can better focus on maintaining quality. Less variety in stores helps it use space more efficiently: its sales per square foot are three times that of Walmart. And with fewer products, Costco turns over its wares almost twice as fast as usual for retailers, meaning less capital gets tied up in inventory. It has also expanded its own brand, Kirkland Signature, which now accounts for over a quarter of its sales, well above average for a retailer. Its margins on its own-brand products are about six percentage points higher than for brands such as Hershey or Kellogg’s.\nLast, Costco stands out among retailers for how it treats its employees. Some 60% of retail employees leave their jobs each year. Staff turnover at Costco is just 8%; over a third of workers have been there for more than ten years. One reason for low attrition is pay. Its wages are higher than the industry average and it offers generous medical and retirement benefits. Another is career prospects. The company prefers to promote leaders from within. Although Mr Galanti’s successor has come from outside, the rest of Costco’s executive team has been with the company for more than 20 years. The late Mr Munger was confident that Costco had “a marvellous future”. Its customers could be enjoying $1.50 hot dogs for many years to come. ■\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

Clement Attlee sold post-war nationalisations with the mien of a staid bank manager. Ahead of the party’s landslide win in 1997, New Labour pledged to copy years of restrictive Tory spending targets. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has adopted a similar tactic ahead of Labour’s widely expected election win on July 4th.\nBarring a few titbits of extra spending—worth around £10bn ($12.7bn, or 0.4% of gdp) annually and funded by taxes on private schools, home purchases by foreigners and the like—she wants to stick to plans set out by Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, in March. She has also committed herself to the fiscal rule that government debt must be projected to fall as a share of gdp in the fifth year of five-year forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (obr), a watchdog.\nSee our other coverage of Britain’s election, including our poll tracker, updated daily.\nSquaring that with Labour’s pledge not to return to austerity will be tricky. The commitments that New Labour inherited were a squeeze; those that Ms Reeves has signed up to are suffocating. They imply hefty real-terms cuts to frayed courts, policing and local government. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (ifs), a think-tank, reckons that it would cost around £30bn extra annually by 2028 to prevent them.\nLabour says that growth, not tax, is the answer. But it takes time for growth-enhancing policies to have an effect and the obr’s gdp projections are already bullish compared with those of other forecasters. Falling interest rates could also help a little by pulling down debt-servicing costs. Year-on-year inflation stood at 2% in May, back in line with the Bank of England’s (boe’s) official target. The ifs estimates that a one-percentage-point decline in gilt yields would boost fiscal headroom by £12bn. But rates will not reliably fall.\nThat leaves two other options: more borrowing or higher taxes. Labour is likely to opt for a bit of both. Britain’s fiscal rules are pretty loose for those willing to stretch them. The binding fiscal rule governs borrowing only in the last year of the obr forecast. A short-term borrowing spree spent on public investment would comply with the rules Ms Reeves has committed to. A more radical option would be to change how the boe books its quantitative-easing (qe) losses, which are projected to cost around £20bn per year until 2032. Most rich countries realise them more gradually, reducing their fiscal impact.\nchart: the economist\nStill, too large a borrowing splurge would be foolish when interest rates are so high. Labour will also be especially wary of denting its aura of fiscal credibility. That leaves taxes. Post-election tax hikes are a well-worn political formula. Within a year of being elected British governments have raised taxes by 0.5% of gdp on average since 1979, The Economist calculates (see chart). That would be around £14bn today.\nSmall increases to broad-based taxes like income tax, national insurance or vat would be best. But Labour has ruled out raising the headline rate of all three, as well as of corporation tax (though it may have left some room in its manifesto wording to fiddle with income-tax thresholds).\nCapital-gains tax (cgt) looks a more likely target. Labour has said it has no plans to raise cgt but ruled it out firmly only for primary homes. Secrecy here has a valid economic rationale: asset-holders could cash out early if an increase were pre-announced. And there are also some grounds for raising it: capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate than salary or dividend income. But Labour should tread lightly; capital can be flighty and a high cgt rate may deter investment. Increases should also be coupled with reforms to ensure that only returns above inflation are taxed. Fully equalising cgt with income taxes, and taxing only non-inflationary gains, would raise £16.7bn annually, says Arun Advani of Warwick University.\nLabour will probably opt for a jumble of smaller levies, too. “The Treasury is quite creative,” says Thomas Pope of the Institute for Government, another think-tank; mandarins won’t struggle to conjure up new taxes. The challenge is doing so without further distorting the economy and complicating the tax code.\nUpdating out-of-date council-tax valuations would be sensible but politically unpopular, as would other reforms like widening the vat base. Labour may opt for smaller fiddles: narrowing inheritance-tax reliefs for small-cap equities, farms and the like; raising sugar taxes; or lifting tinier levies like insurance-premium tax. Stealth taxes will have obvious appeal. Income-tax and national-insurance thresholds are frozen until 2028, quietly pulling more people into higher tax bands as wages rise. Labour could well extend that freeze.\nThankfully, however, Ms Reeves has ruled out another stealth tax: tiering Bank of England reserves so that banks are paid interest on only a fraction of them. That proposal is central to the economic plans of Reform uk, Nigel Farage’s populist outfit. It is in effect a tax on banks, but far more convoluted than a direct levy. It risks gumming up the transmission of monetary policy as well as turning qe into a reliable money-spinner for the Treasury.\nIt looks likely that a Labour government would try to muddle through with a bit more borrowing, a sprinkling of tax rises and a little trimming to spending, in the hope that growth will eventually change the fiscal picture. But it will struggle to skirt tougher choices. If Labour wants to make swift progress on improving public services and alleviating poverty, more money will be needed. And although the forces squeezing the British state—most obviously, the impact of an ageing population—have featured only sporadically in the campaign, they will be inescapable in government. ■\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",

After seven years under his centrist government, voters’ judgment threatens to be severe. It may well plunge France into a political, and perhaps even economic, crisis. One victim would be Mr Macron’s own project of reform.\nThe signs so far are ominous. The stockmarket has fallen by 4% since he made his announcement on June 9th, the night of his party’s drubbing in the European Parliament elections at the hands of Marine Le Pen’s National Rally. Share prices in France’s three big banks are down by almost 10%. Bond spreads are widening. Euro-elections tend to be a protest vote, not a reflection of how people will express themselves when choosing their national parliament. This time, however, their anger now has barely a week left to dissipate and the polls show no sign that it will.\nchart: the economist\nThe president faces a squeeze between Ms Le Pen’s hard right and a rapidly created New Popular Front that includes powerful hard-left elements, especially the Unsubmissive France party dominated by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a former Trotskyist. Mr Macron seems to have assumed such an alliance would not be formed so fast. France’s parliamentary elections use a two-round system, with a high threshold for going through to the second round. The danger is that most of the president’s men and women will not make it that far—leaving a choice between the xenophobic nationalists and the anti-capitalist radicals. His political group, Ensemble, faces losing half its seats or more.\nMr Macron will remain in office; his term does not expire until 2027. But although the president has extensive powers over defence and foreign policy, new domestic policy, like the budget, needs to be voted through by parliament. Administering it is the preserve of the government, headed by a prime minister whom the president picks but whom parliament can dismiss through a simple confidence vote. In practice, Mr Macron will have little choice but to offer the job to the nominee of whichever party or alliance comes top. Mr Macron may hope that his centrists can forge a post-election alliance with other moderates, but the numbers do not look close to adding up.\nThat leaves three options: a hung parliament, or a government of either the hard right or hard left. None of them is good. Both the right and the left are committed to doing things France cannot afford. These include imposing punitive wealth taxes, slashing vat on fuel and scrapping Mr Macron’s reforms of the pension system, so that France can go back to one of the earliest retirement ages in the world. (The right would add harsh restrictions on immigration, citizenship and free movement to the mix; the left, a big jump in the minimum wage.) The problems are compounded by the fact that France is already running a high budget deficit, of over 5% of gdp this year.\nThe most likely outcome is a hung parliament with an unstable government. It might be even worse. As everyone jockeyed for advantage in the presidential poll in three years’ time, legislation would struggle to get through, even a budget. The gridlock could spread to the European Union. The one thing the hard left and right might agree on would be to ditch most of the past seven years’ reforms.\nMr Macron’s ambition was to transform France’s political system by strengthening its moderate elements, and to permanently shift the national consensus towards economic modernisation. Right now his legacy looks more likely to be reforms that do not stick and a political centre that has been eviscerated—so much so that his successor as president may yet be his nemesis, Ms Le Pen. ■",

He became friends with the heir to Moët & Chandon, now the world’s largest seller of French bubbly, while studying at a military academy. Later, as emperor, Napoleon stopped in Épernay on his way to, and back from, war. “In victory, you deserve champagne; in defeat, you need it,” he said.\nChampagne now merits its own victory tour. The value of sales of champagne hit €6.4bn ($6.9bn) in 2023; 2021-23 were the best years on record, even after accounting for inflation (see chart). Over the past five years the “Champagne 50” index, which tracks the value of the top brands traded on Liv-ex, a wine-buying platform, has surged by 47%, more than any other regional index worldwide, including Bordeaux (up by 1.3%), Burgundy (25%) and Italy (29%). In the past half-decade the Wine Advocate has published more articles and reviews devoted to champagne than it did in the preceding 41 years since its founding, says William Kelley, the editor-in-chief. (Bottles can bear the “champagne” name only if they hail from that region of north-eastern France near Épernay.)\nchart: the economist\nOn June 20th in Paris Sotheby’s is holding the world’s first champagne-only auction, which is expected to raise €1.5m-1.9m. From 2022-23 the volume and value of champagne sold by Sotheby’s nearly tripled. Last year a champagne producer, Krug, ranked in the top ten wine producers sold by the auction house for the first time.\nThe fact that wine aficionados have only lately lapped up champagne may be a surprise. Champagne has long been a luxury brand in its own right, a global symbol of celebration and splurging. lvmh, a French luxury-goods juggernaut, has collected champagne companies like a tippler acquiring bottles: it owns seven, including Dom Pérignon, Krug, Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot. Together, they account for an estimated 46% of global champagne sales by value and 23% by volume, according to Edouard Aubin of Morgan Stanley. (The disparity arises because lvmh sells a lot of “prestige cuvées”, an elegant-sounding term for expensive bottles.)\nBig champagne houses can afford Balthazar-size advertising budgets. For much of modern history champagne has been “pushed as a bubbly drink for bubbly people”, writes Robert Walters in “Bursting Bubbles” a book about champagne. It has been drunk by rappers and those wrapping up their evenings at night clubs. This “double-edged marketing…has both led to champagne’s incredible popularity and diminished its reputation” among connoisseurs, according to Mr Walters. Oenophiles did not take it very seriously. “Champagne was considered a fine thing, but not necessarily a fine wine,” explains Justin Gibbs of Liv-ex.\nWine-lovers, however, have started to look at their champagne flutes differently. “People now view champagne as a wine and not just a celebratory drink,” says Jamie Graham of Brunswick Fine Wines and Spirits, a British merchant. Instead of being regarded as a mere aperitif to be sipped before moving on to something more serious, champagne is now being savoured and paired with food more often.\nTwo things changed. One was covid, which gave wine-lovers more time at home to research and try new bottles. It may seem odd that a festive drink flourished at such a bleak time. But well-off people who were not going out to dine in restaurants sought pleasures at home, sometimes bidding in online auctions for new bottles. They also had more time to study the terroir of champagne and producers’ different methods of blending and adding dosage (a mixture including cane sugar that sweetens it before bottling). In other words, drinkers started to “understand there is a wine behind the bubble”, says Arthur Larmandier of Larmandier-Bernier, a champagne house. At first Mr Larmandier thought it would take five years for champagne to bounce back from covid; instead, demand surged, and it “took six months”.\nThe second factor is more appreciation for the smaller houses that produce limited quantities of high-quality bubbly. Prices for these “grower” champagnes have rocketed on the secondary market: the Wine Market Journal’s grower-champagne index has more than doubled in value since 2019. Oenophiles now invoke these winemakers’ last names with the fondness that football players refer to their teammates: Selosse, Prévost, Collin, Bouchard, Egly-Ouriet. (Selosse, at around $650 a bottle, is the Lionel Messi of grower champagne.)\nGrowers have brought artisanal winemaking techniques to champagne, relying more on ripe, carefully tended grapes than on dosage; this leads to a lower sugar profile and greater complexity. Appreciation of grower champagne connects with a broader trend in culture, including gastronomy, whereby people are seeking out local, authentic producers and tastes, says Mr Kelley of the Wine Advocate. More reviews of champagne by Mr Kelley and fellow critics piqued the interest of collectors and investors, who found even the highest-quality champagne undervalued, relative to top wines from Burgundy and Bordeaux.\nThe grower-champagne producers are disrupters, changing not only oenophiles’ minds about French bubbly but also the viticulture practices of some of the largest houses. Recently the grandes marques have been investing more in releases from specific vineyards, which can compete better with grower champagne. They have also altered their marketing, no longer showing photos of suit-clad cellar masters in wine caves but instead featuring them in humble attire in vineyards, closer to the vines.\nThis is not champagne’s first transformation. In the 17th century, when Dom Pérignon, a monk, was making it in his abbey, bubbles were seen as a flaw: champagne then was a still wine. (Though Pérignon is credited with being the “inventor” of champagne, that is just marketing; his famous remark “Come quickly, I am drinking the stars!” first appeared in a 19th-century advert.) It was only in the 18th century that the Champagne region embraced bubbles, as both a source of differentiation and a justification for higher prices.\nFlights of fancy\nWhat does the future hold? France used to buy most champagne, but that changed in 2012. Now America and Japan are important growth markets, says Stéphane Dalyac, chief executive of Laurent-Perrier, a prominent house. Unlike many firms peddling well-known luxury brands, bubbly-makers are not optimistic in the near term about China, where buyers over 40 tend not to gravitate to the cold fizziness of champagne, Mr Dalyac says.\nBut the sun is shining on champagne in many ways. Climate change is helping the region’s wine by ripening grapes naturally, therefore requiring less dosage, says Peter Gibson of the Wine Market Journal,. Many think the effect of grower champagne will endure, elevating the whole region’s quality for years to come.\nRecently champagne houses, thirsting for greater profits, decided to raise prices heftily to exploit the boom, thinking drinkers would tolerate it. However, demand for some fine wines has sputtered, sending wine indexes down. Inflation more broadly and economic uncertainty have also caused consumers to pull back. Champagne houses may be forced to adjust prices downward slightly, to keep demand high. Call it a champagne problem. ■\nFor more on the latest books, films, tv shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter",

However it begins, summer in the northern hemisphere—where more than 85% of the world’s population live—soon involves dangerous levels of heat. This year is no exception—indeed, it carries the trend further. In Saudi Arabia more than 1,300 pilgrims died during the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, as temperatures exceeded 50°C. India’s capital, Delhi, endured 40 days above 40°C between May and June. And in Mexico scores of howler monkeys have been falling dead from the trees with heatstroke.\nmap: the economist\nThat this summer looks set to be punishing should not be a surprise. Global average temperatures have broken records for every month of the past year. And the hot El Niño phase of the oscillating system of Pacific currents and winds called enso only recently ended. But it would be wrong to see this summer as exceptional in today’s world. Stripping out year-to-year variability, the planet is now about 1.2°C warmer than it was in the 19th century. And small-sounding shifts in the average temperature have a disproportionate effect on what goes on at the extremes. Already in many places the number of days in which people around the world are exposed to “very strong” or “extreme” heat stress—which can pose a threat to life—is alarmingly high (see map).\nCruel summers\nThat brings enormous burdens. Heatwaves are among the deadliest weather and climate disasters globally, according to the un and the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent. Firm numbers are hard to come by, but one analysis published in the Lancet in 2021 estimated that heat contributed to an annual average of 489,000 deaths globally between 2000 and 2019. Almost a quarter were in southern Asia alone.\nSuch estimates, including those used in the Lancet, are typically based on “excess deaths”—how many more people died across a period than might ordinarily be expected—a measure which is both imperfect and often available only well after the fact. It is harder still to pinpoint heat effects that are detrimental but not fatal. The problem is acute in poor countries with sparse health services, where the toll of high temperatures is not known.\nchart: the economist\nThe economic costs can be estimated too, and they are significant. Heat has been shown to have a sapping effect on productivity—a separate analysis in the Lancet last year estimated that high temperatures led to 490bn lost labour hours in 2022 around the world, an increase of almost 42% from the annual average for 1991-2000. That, they reckon, reduced earnings in South-East Asia alone by the equivalent of almost 5% of the region’s gdp. Extreme temperatures can also play havoc with crop yields. A severe hot spell in the spring of 2022, for example, is thought to have reduced India’s national wheat production for that year by 4.5%.\nmap: the economist\nThere are myriad ways to adapt to these new risks and burdens: none is perfect; too few are being attempted. For heatwaves, in particular, efforts to deal with the problem are lagging behind its increasing salience. In many places a summer that might have been expected once a century between the 1950s and 1980s is now likely to occur once every five years. But many countries have no systematic plans to deal with them. And the plans they do have may be ineffective.\nHigh temperatures generally kill people by exacerbating their existing health issues, such as heart and kidney disease or diabetes; this is one of the reasons that deaths are clustered among the old, the poor and the socially isolated. Temperatures soar far higher in crowded areas, which tend to be cities’ poorest neighbourhoods. Cheap building materials, such as metal roofs, exacerbate risks; so does a lack of trees which provide both shade and, through the evapotranspiration of water from their leaves, cooling. Homelessness is more dangerous still.\nBasic information is central to planning responses. “You need to sit down with three data sets—income, electricity and water provision—and see where those are lowest,” says Aditya Valiathan Pillai, a fellow at Sustainable Futures Collaborative, a climate think-tank in Delhi. “That’s where you need to go.” To reduce deaths in a city of 25m, he says, most of the effort needs to go on just 500,000.\nDeploying resources at the right time would also help. Temperatures are relatively easy to predict. In large parts of the world the problem is that early-warning systems are inadequate, not that the forecasts they rely on are hazy. Still, improving meteorological services would boost the countries where they still lag behind, including across large swathes of Africa. And in rich countries, more finely grained forecasts would help power providers avoid blackouts—a growing risk as more air-conditioning is needed to weather hot spells.\nOther potentially useful interventions lie well outside the traditional scope of climate or health policies, and within the realms of urban planning or labour-market regulation. Workers forced to toil in sweltering conditions are particularly at risk of illness and death. This is true for those outside, such as in agriculture and construction, but also for those crammed inside within poorly ventilated settings. Commonsense measures, like mandatory access to water, shade and rest when the mercury soars, can make a world of difference. But businesses are often hostile to increased regulation of this sort, fearing it will cut into their bottom line.\nCalifornia, a state with a huge agricultural and manufacturing workforce, has struggled for several years to extend its heat-related regulations. A proposal to enact heat standards for indoor workers (it already has provisions for outdoor workers) was meant to be passed in 2019; it finally won approval this month. But it excludes tens of thousands of employees working in prisons over cost concerns. America has no federal heat protections for workers; many Republican states resist giving them. A new law in Florida prohibits municipal authorities from introducing them.\nElsewhere, the challenge lies in changing norms that make populations more susceptible to heat stress. This appears particularly true in Europe, where many countries’ infrastructure was designed for a climate distinctly cooler than today’s. Perhaps unsurprisingly, places that have long had hot summers fare better. Spain is a good example. Houses in the south of the country tend to be whitewashed, often with shady interior courtyards.\nEven in the northern capital of Madrid, the most modest dwellings typically come with awnings to keep the sun off windows or shutters to block it out entirely. Though many Spaniards no longer nap in the middle of the day, a siesta-style break is still common in much of the country, with shops and businesses shut in the hottest period of the afternoon. This gives everyone a chance to rest.\nSpain makes more concerted efforts to beat the heat, too. Most of the country is covered by dedicated heat plans, and the national government co-ordinates a heatwave alert system. Madrid’s plan includes measures to reduce or change school hours, increase the frequency of public transport to avoid people waiting outside on platforms, and to subsidise air-conditioning upgrades in homes.\nThis year the city has also opened up access to air-conditioned spaces like museums, and encouraged people to use them. A 36-year study, from 1980 to 2015, attributed a decline in heat-attributable deaths in Spain to both “societal adaptation” and “socioeconomic development”. A repeatedly finessed heat plan in neighbouring France is thought to have reduced deaths in the very worst heatwaves by up to 90%.\nIn the hot seats\nAs well as taking more steps of this kind, municipalities and regions need to make sure that they work, and adapt them when they don’t. In 2013 Ahmedabad, in India’s western state of Gujarat, generated attention and headlines for being the first city in South Asia to implement a heat-action plan. Its measures included strengthening the early-warning system for heatwaves and instructing local authorities when to send extra staff to medical centres. A study published in 2018 credited the plan with averting more than 1,000 deaths in the year after it was launched.\nWhether it is still fit for purpose a decade later is an open question. The plan is hard to assess because it is not routinely evaluated, a common problem with climate policies. “I wish I could say that Ahmedabad did a great job this year,” says Mr Pillai. “They probably did. But how do I know?” Ascertaining how well current policies have performed is crucial to coping in the future. And there will be a great deal of coping to do. ■",

        "body": "T\nhe heavily armed men and armoured vehicles that swarmed down the streets of La Paz, Bolivia’s capital, had one destination: the presidential palace. After a small tank repeatedly rammed into the doors of the palace, soldiers pushed inside. The leader of the uprising clambered out of an armoured vehicle to reveal himself as Juan José Zúñiga, the commander of the armed forces, at least until his sacking earlier this week. He told reporters that “there will be a new cabinet of ministers” and that “our country cannot continue like this any longer.” He demanded politicians “stop destroying, stop impoverishing our country, stop humiliating our army”, and said the army was trying to install “a true democracy”. The army, he underscored, “did not lack balls”.\nPresident Luis Arce did not lack them either. At one point he emerged to argue face to face with the putschists. Returning inside, with the booms of tear gas fired at pro-democracy protesters audible, he was able to hold a ceremony appointing new heads of the armed forces. It was an “atypical” day he noted dryly but swore “we will defeat any coup attempt.” He called on Bolivians to mobilise to defend democracy, but also to stay calm. The new top brass demanded all soldiers return to the barracks. Meanwhile one of Bolivia’s biggest unions announced a general strike in protest at the coup attempt. Condemnation of the attempted putsch poured in from leaders across the world.\nAlmost as suddenly as they had arrived, the soldiers left, replaced by surging crowds of civilians chanting in support of democracy. Mr Arce emerged onto the presidential balcony and shouted through a loud hailer that “No one can take away the democracy that we have won at the polls and with the blood of the Bolivian people.” The apparent coup attempt had failed.\nThat is good news for a region that believed coups were largely consigned to history. But the uprising was prompted, at least in some way, by a profound political and economic crisis. Ahead of elections next year a power struggle looms between Mr Arce and Evo Morales, a former president. Tensions between the pair—both leftists and former colleagues—have paralysed the government, aggravated economic woes and, in turn, fuelled street protests. The sight of tanks ramming the presidential palace has succeeded only in making Bolivia appear more unstable and chaotic to businesses, investors and tourists.\nThe rolling political crisis began in 2019 when Mr Morales ran for an unconstitutional third term. He won, but after accusations of fraud and mass protests that caused 36 deaths the army asked him to resign. He did so, and left the country.\nIn 2020 Bolivia elected as president Mr Arce, who had been economy minister under Mr Morales. But as the pandemic battered the country, the economy slumped. Mr Morales returned and announced he would run against Mr Arce in 2025, something the president says is unconstitutional (the constitutional court agrees). Meanwhile Mr Morales’s allies in Congress have made it near impossible for Mr Arce to govern, blocking efforts to secure loans to relieve pressure on the government purse and scotching plans to bring in foreign investors to mine abundant reserves of lithium. Mr Arce complains of an “economic boycott” by his rival’s allies. Mr Morales has threatened to unleash unrest if he is stopped from running.\nThe uprising momentarily seemed to unite the two angry leftists. Mr Morales quickly denounced the attempted putsch and called for a mass mobilisation to protect democracy. It may have helped that in his brief moment in the afternoon sun, General Zúñiga appeared to favour the political right.\nYet with soldiers back in their barracks the chances of a smooth resolution to the leftists’ dispute remain slim. Indeed, the army’s escapade may deepen it. By the evening of June 26th Mr Zúñiga had been arrested. He may have been attempting to seize power and to use the political and economic crisis to justify it. But as he was taken away he accused Mr Arce of asking him to stage an uprising “to raise [the president’s] popularity”. Before he could say more he was bundled away. Even if untrue, the accusations may fuel more political chaos.\nMeanwhile ordinary Bolivians continue to struggle. The country is desperately short of dollars making fuel, which is largely imported, similarly scarce. The official exchange rate between the boliviano and the dollar has all but collapsed. The black-market rate is some 50% above the official one. Bolivian merchants have flooded over the border into Brazil and Peru desperately trying to buy dollars for a steep premium.\nThe government spends some $2bn a year to import subsidised fuel, nearly bankrupting it. The country’s natural gas reserves, once a source of strength, are fading fast in part due to lack of investment by the state-owned hydrocarbons company. By 2030 it may be a net importer of natural gas. In February Fitch downgraded the country’s debt from junk to even grimier junk. Now deep divisions in the army must be added to the wider political crisis. ■",

        "body": "I\nn recent years Paris has undergone an astonishing revival. Global businessmen, financiers and techies casually drop into conversation that they are spending more time in the City of Light. Wall Street banks have expanded their offices there; venture capitalists are signing more cheques for French startups. An annual investment summit, held in May at the Palace of Versailles, has become a fixture in chief executives’ calendars. This year, as they sipped champagne with President Emmanuel Macron, company bosses pledged investment projects worth €15bn ($16bn).\nThe renaissance is part of Mr Macron’s ambition to make France more innovative and business-friendly. But the project is now in danger. After his centrist party suffered a drubbing in the elections to the European Parliament, Mr Macron called a snap national parliamentary election, the first round of which is due to be held on June 30th. Hard-right and hard-left parties are polling well ahead of Mr Macron’s group. Both have unsustainable spending plans that are spooking investors and are far from friendly to global business. Only a few weeks ago Paris, which is also due to host the 2024 Summer Olympics in July, was basking in the limelight. Now a cloud of uncertainty hangs over its great commercial revival.\nParis was once seen as a city of red tape, high taxes and clogged-up streets, which dimmed its appeal to anyone other than tourists. But over the seven years that Mr Macron, a former investment banker, has been in charge, much has changed. That is most evident in two areas: finance and tech.\nchart: the economist\nOver the past decade Paris has been climbing the rankings of the world’s financial centres (see chart 1). French financiers manage €5trn in assets, up from €3.8trn in 2015. Amundi, a French firm that has become Europe’s biggest fund manager, looks after €2.1trn-worth, more than double the figure a decade ago. Wall Street has been increasing its Parisian presence. In 2021 JPMorgan Chase, America’s biggest bank, inaugurated Paris as its main European trading floor, where it now employs around 1,000 people. Bank of America has increased its Parisian headcount ten-fold, to 700; Citigroup’s has risen from 170 to 400, with space in its office for 200 more. Morgan Stanley has more than doubled its headcount in Paris over the past three years.\nchart: the economist\nAn effervescent startup scene, meanwhile, is drawing in venture capitalists. In the first quarter of this year they invested $1.5bn in Paris-based startups, according to kpmg, an advisory firm (see chart 2). Around $500m of that went to firms working on “generative” artificial intelligence (ai) of the sort that makes Chatgpt a human-like conversationalist. Their counterparts in London, historically Europe’s premier tech hub, attracted just $100m in the same period. Only America and China are home to a greater number of “notable” machine-learning models, according to a report by Stanford University.\nOf the 100 billion-dollar startups to watch in Europe, 21 are French, according to gp Bullhound, an advisory firm, neck and neck with Britain (which has 22) and way ahead of Germany (with 14). A recent report by Accel, a venture-capital firm, notes that former employees of 28 such “unicorns” in France have gone on to establish 186 new startups between them. And, as one venture-capital investor puts it, in tech, “France is Paris—and Paris is super-hot at the moment.”\nIn contrast to the previous wave of French startups, which offered domestic e-commerce and mobile services, the latest lot harbour grander ambitions from the get-go, notes Philippe Botteri of Accel. Founders of new ai firms “now immediately have a global pitch”, agrees Xavier Niel, a telecoms mogul turned venture capitalist and founder of Station f, a bustling tech incubator in Paris. Mistral ai, a maker of cutting-edge generative-ai models, is now talked about with the same breathlessness as Openai, creator of Chatgpt. This month it raised €600m in a funding round that reportedly valued it at nearly €6bn. In May H, a fellow Parisian ai darling formerly known as Holistic ai, announced a $220m seed round only months after it was co-founded by a French researcher at Stanford University and four former employees of DeepMind, the ai lab of Google.\nRead more of our coverage of France’s elections:\nThe alarming foreign policies of France’s hard right and hard left\nEmmanuel Macron faces heavy losses after a short campaign\nA hard-right 28-year-old could soon be France’s prime minister\nOur French election poll tracker\nWhat has driven the great Parisian revival? Luck has played a part. After Britain formally left the eu in 2020 bankers were no longer legally able to serve their European clients from London. For those financiers who did not want to decamp from the British capital, Paris, a two-hour train ride away, was easier to get to than Frankfurt. For those who did decide to move, it was a more pleasant place to live. One finance boss recalls asking his London-based traders to move to Frankfurt, only for them to go home, speak to their partners and return the next day saying “absolutely not”. When he posed the same question about Paris, the family reaction was “of course”. (Preferential tax treatment of foreigners for the first few years of their residency did not hurt, either.)\nThe boom in ai, meanwhile, has put a huge premium on the sort of mathematical skills that have long been the forte of Paris’s renowned technical universities. Two of Mistral’s six co-founders are products of Ecole Polytechnique; a third graduated from Ecole Normale Supérieure. This talent pool drew America’s tech giants such as Google and Meta, which opened big ai labs in Paris. It also helps that France’s nuclear-powered electricity grid can provide lots of clean energy to feed power-hungry ai data centres.\nBut there is more to the city’s recent streak than just good fortune. Take finance, where France was not merely a passive beneficiary of Brexit. Frankfurt’s banking cluster and proximity to the European Central Bank initially made it the more obvious destination for relocation. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, remembers that when the bank was first looking for alternatives to London after Brexit, Paris barely featured in the conversation. Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt were all viewed more favourably. What made a difference, Mr Dimon says, was the French president. Mr Macron made it clear to him that France was open for business, and even went out of his way to suggest a possible location for a trading floor. “This is the first time that we have a president who is a former investment banker, who is fluent in English, who is globally minded, who is pro-business, and who has no inhibition about interacting with the business community,” says Stéphane Boujnah, the French boss of Euronext, a pan-European bourse.\nMr Macron has translated this pro-business attitude into predictable policy. Bruno Le Maire, finance minister since 2017, has held that office for the longest stretch since the modern French republic was founded in 1958 and, in the words of the ceo of a giant global asset manager, “brought a lot of credibility”. He and Mr Macron promised from the start not to raise taxes, and stuck to their word. They introduced a flat tax on investment income and ditched an unloved (and unworkable) wealth tax. The sense of stability and openness has been strengthened further by the regional government under Valérie Pécresse, who has overseen an expansion of the city’s underground network.\nMr Macron’s government was also early to see ai’s potential. It produced its first national ai strategy already in 2018, drawn up by Cédric Villani, a mathematician. Cédric O, one of Mistral’s co-founders, who was previously Mr Macron’s digital minister, says that the critical decision was to woo American big tech. “At the time people said: you are crazy putting out the red carpet for the Americans; they are going to steal your talent.” In fact, the opposite happened. Many Parisian ai founders, including the Mistral trio, left big tech’s research outposts to strike out on their own.\nThis business-friendly approach may not survive the parliamentary election. Although Mr Macron himself will remain in office until 2027, some of his reforms could be undone. Both Marine Le Pen’s hard-right National Rally and the New Popular Front (npf), a left-wing alliance led by a former Trotskyist, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, promise to bring back the wealth tax. The npf would also rise the minimum wage, which could deter job creation. Patrick Martin, head of the medef, a business lobby, has called both their programmes “a danger to the economy”.\nIn the event of a hung parliament, which looks increasingly likely, the most extreme of these policies may not be implemented. Even so, politics look likely to get in the way of Paris’s revival as a global commercial centre. The city benefited from having politicians in charge who understood and welcomed business, and who worked together to draw in foreign talent and capital. With that project almost certain to lose steam after the parliamentary elections, global bosses may find themselves with fewer reasons to drop by. ■",

        "body": "W\nith the cut-off date for postal-voting applications already past, the Tories are polling at historically awful levels. It is not simply that other parties—Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Reform uk—are taking chunks out of their support. It is the way they are doing it. A new mega-poll conducted by The Economist in partnership with WeThink, a research outfit, suggests that they are hacking away at even the safest Tory seats.\nBetween May 30th and June 21st, WeThink asked 18,595 adults how they intend to vote in the general election. The results suggest Labour has a 20-percentage-point lead over the Conservatives, by 42% to 22%. Reform uk is on course for 14% of the vote, the Liberal Democrats 11% and the Green Party 6%. This is a dramatic turnaround from the 2019 election, when the Tories led by 12 points, and would be the largest swing between the main parties in modern history. But even that does not tell the full story.\nSee our other coverage of Britain’s election, including our poll tracker, updated daily\nBecause of the mega-poll’s large sample size, The Economist is able to use it to analyse local and demographic trends in voting intention. Using a statistical technique called multilevel regression and poststratification (mrp), we have produced estimates of voting intentions for each constituency in Britain. These mrp estimates suggest that the Labour Party is on course to win 465 seats, 263 more than it won at the 2019 election. The Tories are heading for just 76 seats, the lowest number in the party’s history. The Liberal Democrats are estimated to win 52, their best result since 2010; the Scottish National Party is on track to lose 19 seats in Scotland, though it would remain the largest party there. Reform uk and the Green Party are on course to take three seats each.\nClose readers will notice that these tallies differ from the predictions of our election model. During the same period that the mega-poll was being conducted, that model was giving a central estimate of around 185 mps for the Tories, a very heavy defeat but not a rout. The key difference lies in the “efficiency” of each party’s vote—how many seats they can expect to win for a given number of votes. Our prediction model, which is based on national and regional polls, assumes the distribution of votes for each party across seats would be similar from election to election. Our mrp poll shows that the Tories are underperforming in marginal constituencies.\nThis is because opposition parties and voters are highly co-ordinated. Labour has explicitly targeted “hero voters” who supported the Conservatives in 2019. These are people who are older, working-class, Leave-voting and overrepresented in marginal constituencies in the north of England. The Liberal Democrats may have rather similar policies but they have targeted very different voters—wealthier, more educated and more likely to have voted Remain and to live in the south.\nchart: the economist\nThe mrp poll shows that Labour’s vote share has risen by 11 percentage points in competitive seats where they face the Conservatives, compared with eight points in constituencies where the Lib Dems are the Tories’ main rivals. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, have gone backwards in most of the country compared with 2019 but, crucially, have increased their vote share by three percentage points in seats where they are competitive with the Conservatives (see chart 1).\nThis dynamic on its own is enough to make the Tories susceptible to substantial losses. But the installation of Nigel Farage as leader of Reform uk on June 3rd has made even Conservative mps with huge majorities vulnerable. Reform uk draws its support overwhelmingly from the Tories. The loss of white, non-graduate Leavers seems to be causing the Tory vote share to tumble in former strongholds: our mrp poll estimates that it will fall by over 30 percentage points in seats where they won more than 60% of the vote in 2019. Reform gains the votes; Labour reaps the rewards.\nMany mrp polls have been published since Mr Farage became leader of Reform uk; all agree that the Conservatives are heading for a landslide defeat. But the range of outcomes is large: four of these recent mega-polls have shown Tory seat totals of between 53 and 155. One reason for that great variation is the knife edge that the Conservatives sit on.\nIn our mrp estimates, we find that they win or lose by a margin of less than 5% in 91 constituencies. In these extreme electoral circumstances, the difference between a heavy defeat and a total rout is a very small number of votes. According to our own mrp, if Reform uk were to take just three additional percentage points from the Conservatives, the Tories’ seat total would fall to only 45.\nmrps are not foolproof. Like all polling, an mrp poll is a snapshot and has a substantial margin of error due to statistical variation. Like all modelling, the technique also relies on a number of subjective assumptions—which variables should be included, how turnout is estimated, and so on. These assumptions vary between pollsters, and it is difficult to know which set will produce the most accurate estimates.\nchart: the economist\nThe best approach, therefore, is to pool information from across a full range of forecasts. We have updated our prediction model accordingly, to incorporate the results of all the published mrps, our own included. This “blended” election model, which will be updated between now and July 4th, is our best guess at the final result. At the time of writing its central estimate is that Labour will have 429 mps, the Conservatives 117, the Liberal Democrats 42 seats, the snp 23 and Reform uk two (see chart 2). Pollsters can get things wrong; we will do our own post-mortem after the election. But with only days to go, for this sort of result even to be a possibility is remarkable. ■",

        "body": "Y\nou might expect a party’s leaders to inspire its activists about an upcoming election by invoking the vision of their standard-bearer. But on a recent sweltering Saturday afternoon, in a park in the Democratic stronghold of the South Bronx, in New York, Democrat after Democrat, including three congressmen and a senator, spent 75 minutes addressing a crowd of more than a thousand without mentioning President Joe Biden.\nFor all the enthusiasm, there was, in retrospect, a touching quality to the scene, and not only because the congressman who was the focus of the rally, Jamaal Bowman (pictured), would go on to lose his primary three days later, on June 25th. It captured the predicament Mr Biden has presented to his party’s leftists, and that they are presenting him in return. Can they praise Mr Biden, and he them, without alienating key supporters? Can they criticise one another to court such supporters without helping Donald Trump?\nThe war in Gaza has so sharpened such questions about where Democrats stand that it is splitting the anti-war left itself. Mr Bowman’s criticism of Israel prompted the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (aipac), a pro-Israel group, to spend a record amount of money to defeat him. Yet during the rally, scores of protesters, blocked off by steel barricades and watched by police, chanted for a “free Palestine” and against Mr Bowman and the other Democrats on stage, who included such stars of the left as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders. “aoc, Bowman, Sanders: Shills for ‘Genocide Joe’ Biden!” read one sign. Even from inside the barricades, Mr Sanders drew some boos when he said Israel “had the right to defend itself against a terrorist attack” before adding, “It does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people.”\nMr Biden beat Donald Trump in New York in 2020 by 23 points, but a Siena College poll this month found Mr Biden leading by just eight. He and Democrats generally have lost favour with independent voters and others who do not affiliate with either major party, the state’s second-biggest bloc after Democrats. With six congressional seats in New York believed to be up for grabs—including five picked up by Republicans in 2022—Democrats are trying to reclaim the political centre. Mondaire Jones, a former congressman running in a district adjoining Mr Bowman’s, once advocated defunding the police, but recently told the Washington Post that was “one of the dumbest phrases ever to exist in American politics”. Mr Jones alienated former allies on the left by endorsing Mr Bowman’s opponent, George Latimer.\nThough Democrats’ lurch towards the centre in New York is unmistakable, Mr Bowman’s race is better understood as an indicator of the tensions building within the party than of how they will be resolved. Mr Bowman, a 48-year-old former school principal given to joyfully rapping in social-media posts, is the first member of the “Squad” of progressive legislators to lose a primary. He is black, and his defeat by a 70-year-old white moderate endorsed by the likes of Hillary Clinton might be read as a sign that the establishment is back in control. But Mr Latimer was a formidable candidate with a long record of service as a local elected official, and Mr Bowman, who first won his congressional seat in 2020, was particularly vulnerable.\nMr Bowman went well beyond criticising Israel’s war in Gaza—a mainstream Democratic position—to dismissing reports of rape by Hamas as “propaganda”. He apologised for that, but as recently as the final debate of the primary he accused Israel of “75 years of military occupation”, a view questioning the legitimacy of the state itself. He had troubles apart from the politics of Israel.  It emerged in the campaign that in years past he indulged in conspiracy theories about the attacks of September 11th and other subjects. He was caught on video last year pulling a fire alarm in a House office building, prompting an evacuation before a vote on a funding bill, and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour. He could be tone deaf to the politics of his district, mostly composed of suburbs of New York City. “We’re gonna show fuckin’ aipac the power of the motherfuckin’ South Bronx!” he roared on Saturday—a vow that might have jarred his constituents not merely for its profanity but also because the South Bronx is not in their district.\nThe role of aipac in the race also complicates its lessons. The group’s political arm spent more than $14.5m helping Mr Latimer, the most ever spent by an interest group on a House race, but not by emphasising Mr Bowman’s views on Israel. Instead, its ads portrayed him as undermining Mr Biden by, for example, voting against his infrastructure bill.\nDonald Trump, unifier\nBecause aipac’s donors include Republican billionaires, Mr Bowman charged that “Republican racist maga Trump money” was trying to buy the district for Mr Latimer. Indeed, to some on the left, how Mr Bowman lost is a sign they are winning the larger struggle. As Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, a political action committee, argues, “It shows how weak the establishment and aipac are that they have to resort to breaking records alongside Republican billionaires to advance their interests.” For its part aipac is already boosting the primary opponent of another vulnerable member of the Squad, Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri, whose contest is in August.\nFar more than admiration for Mr Biden, antipathy to Donald Trump is holding the Democratic Party together. That may prove enough to turn out progressives to vote again for the president this autumn. But whoever wins, any polite silence within the party will end after November, and a great, noisy struggle will begin over whether the likes of Mr Bowman, or of Mr Latimer, should represent its future. ■\nStay on top of American politics with The us in brief, our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and Checks and Balance, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.",

        "body": "A\nround nine o’clock in the morning, a tap would come at his window. Outside his house in St Nicholas Place in Harlem milled a group of grinning boys. They carried mop-handles and a pink bouncing ball, all the equipment they needed. The street and the parked cars would provide the rest. What they wanted was to play stickball, and he was only too eager to join them. He’d play for an hour, morning or evening, as his job allowed. Soon he was crouching, swinging the stick, just an ordinary man in a Polo shirt and trousers. But when he made contact he whacked the ball so hard that it went for three or four sewers, or three or four city blocks. Because, after all, he was Willie Mays, then the star of the New York Giants.\nPlaying stickball taught him how to hit curveballs. You never knew how the surface of the street might skew that high, wild bounce. Apart from that, though, he did not have much to learn. His father, nicknamed “Cat” for his slinky prowess on the field, had played baseball between jobs down near Birmingham, Alabama. It was he who taught him how to be a centre fielder and to stick with the game. At 16, playing practically barefooted, he already knew exactly what he had to do. His body was built for baseball, strong, sinewy and graceful, like his Dad’s. He could hit a ball out of the park, defend, outsmart anyone and catch mostly anything. Easy. That happy certainty lasted years.\nThe statistics followed. Over his 22-year Major League career—six years with the Giants in New York, 15 more when they moved west in 1958 to become the San Francisco Giants, two with the New York Mets—he stacked up 3,293 hits, 660 home runs, 339 steals, a .301 batting average, two National League Most Valuable Player awards and 12 Gold Gloves. Ten of those hits, all that were recorded, were added in 2024 from his time in 1948-50 with the Birmingham Black Barons in the segregated Negro League. He could have scored even higher without army service, which he mostly spent playing baseball anyway to entertain the troops.\nEntertainment was the thing. Statistics didn’t lodge in his brain. Besides, a few other players surpassed him in the numbers game, and it never mattered as much as the way he played, with sheer joy. His philosophy was “They throw the ball, I hit it; they hit the ball, I catch it.” If he did that as well as he could, he could lead by example, and make the people around him play better. When younger players asked him for advice, as they often did, he would tell them first to enjoy themselves. He didn’t smoke, drink or fool around with women, because baseball was the most fun he could think of. His pink Lincoln Continental and his smile said it all. He also had ways of making his job even more fun for fans: breaking late on a ball, to bait a runner, before speeding up at just the right time; stealing bases on the riskiest dare, in heroic explosions of dust; and wearing a cap one size too small for him, which at exciting moments would blow right off his head.\nIt blew off, predictably, in his best play of all, in the 1954 World Series when the Giants were facing the Cleveland Indians. Vic Wertz of Cleveland powered the ball to the back of the ground, 460 feet or so, and Willie Mays ran, raced, and right at the wall snagged it with one of his famous basket catches over his left shoulder. It was known ever after as “The Catch”, and brought the crowd to its feet. But he knew he had made better ones than that. For a start, he was sure he would get it. (He often had a strange sort of premonition about that. Lying down at night, watching tv, suddenly a flyball would come out to him, and he’d know how to deal with it. The next day he would recognise that very ball, because he had seen it the night before.) But second, where The Catch was concerned, that was not the most important bit of the play. The vital part was to instantly do a 360, whirl around (cap off) and hurl the ball to the infield, so the runners at the bases couldn’t score. He did it, and the Giants won the Series. Now, that was truly great.\nBeing lighthearted was not always easy. When he signed for the New York Giants in 1950 he went initially to Trenton, New Jersey, in the Interstate League. From being a happy teenager in the Birmingham Black Barons, where they were all brothers and everyone took care of him, he was suddenly the only black player around. As he moved higher, too, the pitching got fiercer. And he knew no one; his nickname, “The Say Hey Kid”, came from his clumsy attempts to break in and make friends. In the smaller towns people said openly that they didn’t like him playing. But he had a neat answer for that: if they mocked him, he’d hit the ball further. After a few nights of that, they would be applauding him.\nRacism followed him, sadly, to the west coast. Two things surprised him about San Francisco. First, how cold and windy Candlestick Park was, so much so that he had to rub himself with hot oil before he played. But second, that he could not buy a house in elegant Sherwood Forest because the white neighbours objected. They backed down, but after two years he moved 3,000 miles to the east coast, just north of New York. The city had always welcomed him with open arms. So though he did not like to be traded, he was content to end his career there with the New York Mets.\nHe hardly ever spoke out about civil rights. Off the field he was shy, and it wasn’t his thing. Other black baseball greats, especially Hank Aaron and Jackie Robinson, criticised him for that. But in Alabama he had learned to keep his head down and his mouth shut. His way of joining in the fight when he retired was again to lead by example, this time by giving his money away. He gave his dentist $12,000 for a new chair, a young woman $10,000 to clear her credit-card debts, and set up the Say Hey Foundation to do what he could for underprivileged youngsters. This, he wanted to say, was how black folk responded to prejudice. Whether by good works or by playing ball, they changed hatred to joy. ■",

        "body": "I\nn recent years Paris has undergone an astonishing revival. Global businessmen, financiers and techies casually drop into conversation that they are spending more time in the City of Light. Wall Street banks have expanded their offices there; venture capitalists are signing more cheques for French startups. An annual investment summit, held in May at the Palace of Versailles, has become a fixture in chief executives’ calendars. This year, as they sipped champagne with President Emmanuel Macron, company bosses pledged investment projects worth €15bn ($16bn).\nThe renaissance is part of Mr Macron’s ambition to make France more innovative and business-friendly. But the project is now in danger. After his centrist party suffered a drubbing in the elections to the European Parliament, Mr Macron called a snap national parliamentary election, the first round of which is due to be held on June 30th. Hard-right and hard-left parties are polling well ahead of Mr Macron’s group. Both have unsustainable spending plans that are spooking investors and are far from friendly to global business. Only a few weeks ago Paris, which is also due to host the 2024 Summer Olympics in July, was basking in the limelight. Now a cloud of uncertainty hangs over its great commercial revival.\nParis was once seen as a city of red tape, high taxes and clogged-up streets, which dimmed its appeal to anyone other than tourists. But over the seven years that Mr Macron, a former investment banker, has been in charge, much has changed. That is most evident in two areas: finance and tech.\nchart: the economist\nOver the past decade Paris has been climbing the rankings of the world’s financial centres (see chart 1). French financiers manage €5trn in assets, up from €3.8trn in 2015. Amundi, a French firm that has become Europe’s biggest fund manager, looks after €2.1trn-worth, more than double the figure a decade ago. Wall Street has been increasing its Parisian presence. In 2021 JPMorgan Chase, America’s biggest bank, inaugurated Paris as its main European trading floor, where it now employs around 1,000 people. Bank of America has increased its Parisian headcount ten-fold, to 700; Citigroup’s has risen from 170 to 400, with space in its office for 200 more. Morgan Stanley has more than doubled its headcount in Paris over the past three years.\nchart: the economist\nAn effervescent startup scene, meanwhile, is drawing in venture capitalists. In the first quarter of this year they invested $1.5bn in Paris-based startups, according to kpmg, an advisory firm (see chart 2). Around $500m of that went to firms working on “generative” artificial intelligence (ai) of the sort that makes Chatgpt a human-like conversationalist. Their counterparts in London, historically Europe’s premier tech hub, attracted just $100m in the same period. Only America and China are home to a greater number of “notable” machine-learning models, according to a report by Stanford University.\nOf the 100 billion-dollar startups to watch in Europe, 21 are French, according to gp Bullhound, an advisory firm, neck and neck with Britain (which has 22) and way ahead of Germany (with 14). A recent report by Accel, a venture-capital firm, notes that former employees of 28 such “unicorns” in France have gone on to establish 186 new startups between them. And, as one venture-capital investor puts it, in tech, “France is Paris—and Paris is super-hot at the moment.”\nIn contrast to the previous wave of French startups, which offered domestic e-commerce and mobile services, the latest lot harbour grander ambitions from the get-go, notes Philippe Botteri of Accel. Founders of new ai firms “now immediately have a global pitch”, agrees Xavier Niel, a telecoms mogul turned venture capitalist and founder of Station f, a bustling tech incubator in Paris. Mistral ai, a maker of cutting-edge generative-ai models, is now talked about with the same breathlessness as Openai, creator of Chatgpt. This month it raised €600m in a funding round that reportedly valued it at nearly €6bn. In May H, a fellow Parisian ai darling formerly known as Holistic ai, announced a $220m seed round only months after it was co-founded by a French researcher at Stanford University and four former employees of DeepMind, the ai lab of Google.\nRead more of our coverage of France’s elections:\nThe alarming foreign policies of France’s hard right and hard left\nEmmanuel Macron faces heavy losses after a short campaign\nA hard-right 28-year-old could soon be France’s prime minister\nOur French election poll tracker\nWhat has driven the great Parisian revival? Luck has played a part. After Britain formally left the eu in 2020 bankers were no longer legally able to serve their European clients from London. For those financiers who did not want to decamp from the British capital, Paris, a two-hour train ride away, was easier to get to than Frankfurt. For those who did decide to move, it was a more pleasant place to live. One finance boss recalls asking his London-based traders to move to Frankfurt, only for them to go home, speak to their partners and return the next day saying “absolutely not”. When he posed the same question about Paris, the family reaction was “of course”. (Preferential tax treatment of foreigners for the first few years of their residency did not hurt, either.)\nThe boom in ai, meanwhile, has put a huge premium on the sort of mathematical skills that have long been the forte of Paris’s renowned technical universities. Two of Mistral’s six co-founders are products of Ecole Polytechnique; a third graduated from Ecole Normale Supérieure. This talent pool drew America’s tech giants such as Google and Meta, which opened big ai labs in Paris. It also helps that France’s nuclear-powered electricity grid can provide lots of clean energy to feed power-hungry ai data centres.\nBut there is more to the city’s recent streak than just good fortune. Take finance, where France was not merely a passive beneficiary of Brexit. Frankfurt’s banking cluster and proximity to the European Central Bank initially made it the more obvious destination for relocation. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, remembers that when the bank was first looking for alternatives to London after Brexit, Paris barely featured in the conversation. Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt were all viewed more favourably. What made a difference, Mr Dimon says, was the French president. Mr Macron made it clear to him that France was open for business, and even went out of his way to suggest a possible location for a trading floor. “This is the first time that we have a president who is a former investment banker, who is fluent in English, who is globally minded, who is pro-business, and who has no inhibition about interacting with the business community,” says Stéphane Boujnah, the French boss of Euronext, a pan-European bourse.\nMr Macron has translated this pro-business attitude into predictable policy. Bruno Le Maire, finance minister since 2017, has held that office for the longest stretch since the modern French republic was founded in 1958 and, in the words of the ceo of a giant global asset manager, “brought a lot of credibility”. He and Mr Macron promised from the start not to raise taxes, and stuck to their word. They introduced a flat tax on investment income and ditched an unloved (and unworkable) wealth tax. The sense of stability and openness has been strengthened further by the regional government under Valérie Pécresse, who has overseen an expansion of the city’s underground network.\nMr Macron’s government was also early to see ai’s potential. It produced its first national ai strategy already in 2018, drawn up by Cédric Villani, a mathematician. Cédric O, one of Mistral’s co-founders, who was previously Mr Macron’s digital minister, says that the critical decision was to woo American big tech. “At the time people said: you are crazy putting out the red carpet for the Americans; they are going to steal your talent.” In fact, the opposite happened. Many Parisian ai founders, including the Mistral trio, left big tech’s research outposts to strike out on their own.\nThis business-friendly approach may not survive the parliamentary election. Although Mr Macron himself will remain in office until 2027, some of his reforms could be undone. Both Marine Le Pen’s hard-right National Rally and the New Popular Front (npf), a left-wing alliance led by a former Trotskyist, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, promise to bring back the wealth tax. The npf would also rise the minimum wage, which could deter job creation. Patrick Martin, head of the medef, a business lobby, has called both their programmes “a danger to the economy”.\nIn the event of a hung parliament, which looks increasingly likely, the most extreme of these policies may not be implemented. Even so, politics look likely to get in the way of Paris’s revival as a global commercial centre. The city benefited from having politicians in charge who understood and welcomed business, and who worked together to draw in foreign talent and capital. With that project almost certain to lose steam after the parliamentary elections, global bosses may find themselves with fewer reasons to drop by. ■",

        "body": "W\nith the cut-off date for postal-voting applications already past, the Tories are polling at historically awful levels. It is not simply that other parties—Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Reform uk—are taking chunks out of their support. It is the way they are doing it. A new mega-poll conducted by The Economist in partnership with WeThink, a research outfit, suggests that they are hacking away at even the safest Tory seats.\nBetween May 30th and June 21st, WeThink asked 18,595 adults how they intend to vote in the general election. The results suggest Labour has a 20-percentage-point lead over the Conservatives, by 42% to 22%. Reform uk is on course for 14% of the vote, the Liberal Democrats 11% and the Green Party 6%. This is a dramatic turnaround from the 2019 election, when the Tories led by 12 points, and would be the largest swing between the main parties in modern history. But even that does not tell the full story.\nSee our other coverage of Britain’s election, including our poll tracker, updated daily\nBecause of the mega-poll’s large sample size, The Economist is able to use it to analyse local and demographic trends in voting intention. Using a statistical technique called multilevel regression and poststratification (mrp), we have produced estimates of voting intentions for each constituency in Britain. These mrp estimates suggest that the Labour Party is on course to win 465 seats, 263 more than it won at the 2019 election. The Tories are heading for just 76 seats, the lowest number in the party’s history. The Liberal Democrats are estimated to win 52, their best result since 2010; the Scottish National Party is on track to lose 19 seats in Scotland, though it would remain the largest party there. Reform uk and the Green Party are on course to take three seats each.\nClose readers will notice that these tallies differ from the predictions of our election model. During the same period that the mega-poll was being conducted, that model was giving a central estimate of around 185 mps for the Tories, a very heavy defeat but not a rout. The key difference lies in the “efficiency” of each party’s vote—how many seats they can expect to win for a given number of votes. Our prediction model, which is based on national and regional polls, assumes the distribution of votes for each party across seats would be similar from election to election. Our mrp poll shows that the Tories are underperforming in marginal constituencies.\nThis is because opposition parties and voters are highly co-ordinated. Labour has explicitly targeted “hero voters” who supported the Conservatives in 2019. These are people who are older, working-class, Leave-voting and overrepresented in marginal constituencies in the north of England. The Liberal Democrats may have rather similar policies but they have targeted very different voters—wealthier, more educated and more likely to have voted Remain and to live in the south.\nchart: the economist\nThe mrp poll shows that Labour’s vote share has risen by 11 percentage points in competitive seats where they face the Conservatives, compared with eight points in constituencies where the Lib Dems are the Tories’ main rivals. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, have gone backwards in most of the country compared with 2019 but, crucially, have increased their vote share by three percentage points in seats where they are competitive with the Conservatives (see chart 1).\nThis dynamic on its own is enough to make the Tories susceptible to substantial losses. But the installation of Nigel Farage as leader of Reform uk on June 3rd has made even Conservative mps with huge majorities vulnerable. Reform uk draws its support overwhelmingly from the Tories. The loss of white, non-graduate Leavers seems to be causing the Tory vote share to tumble in former strongholds: our mrp poll estimates that it will fall by over 30 percentage points in seats where they won more than 60% of the vote in 2019. Reform gains the votes; Labour reaps the rewards.\nMany mrp polls have been published since Mr Farage became leader of Reform uk; all agree that the Conservatives are heading for a landslide defeat. But the range of outcomes is large: four of these recent mega-polls have shown Tory seat totals of between 53 and 155. One reason for that great variation is the knife edge that the Conservatives sit on.\nIn our mrp estimates, we find that they win or lose by a margin of less than 5% in 91 constituencies. In these extreme electoral circumstances, the difference between a heavy defeat and a total rout is a very small number of votes. According to our own mrp, if Reform uk were to take just three additional percentage points from the Conservatives, the Tories’ seat total would fall to only 45.\nmrps are not foolproof. Like all polling, an mrp poll is a snapshot and has a substantial margin of error due to statistical variation. Like all modelling, the technique also relies on a number of subjective assumptions—which variables should be included, how turnout is estimated, and so on. These assumptions vary between pollsters, and it is difficult to know which set will produce the most accurate estimates.\nchart: the economist\nThe best approach, therefore, is to pool information from across a full range of forecasts. We have updated our prediction model accordingly, to incorporate the results of all the published mrps, our own included. This “blended” election model, which will be updated between now and July 4th, is our best guess at the final result. At the time of writing its central estimate is that Labour will have 429 mps, the Conservatives 117, the Liberal Democrats 42 seats, the snp 23 and Reform uk two (see chart 2). Pollsters can get things wrong; we will do our own post-mortem after the election. But with only days to go, for this sort of result even to be a possibility is remarkable. ■",

        "body": "Y\nou might expect a party’s leaders to inspire its activists about an upcoming election by invoking the vision of their standard-bearer. But on a recent sweltering Saturday afternoon, in a park in the Democratic stronghold of the South Bronx, in New York, Democrat after Democrat, including three congressmen and a senator, spent 75 minutes addressing a crowd of more than a thousand without mentioning President Joe Biden.\nFor all the enthusiasm, there was, in retrospect, a touching quality to the scene, and not only because the congressman who was the focus of the rally, Jamaal Bowman (pictured), would go on to lose his primary three days later, on June 25th. It captured the predicament Mr Biden has presented to his party’s leftists, and that they are presenting him in return. Can they praise Mr Biden, and he them, without alienating key supporters? Can they criticise one another to court such supporters without helping Donald Trump?\nThe war in Gaza has so sharpened such questions about where Democrats stand that it is splitting the anti-war left itself. Mr Bowman’s criticism of Israel prompted the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (aipac), a pro-Israel group, to spend a record amount of money to defeat him. Yet during the rally, scores of protesters, blocked off by steel barricades and watched by police, chanted for a “free Palestine” and against Mr Bowman and the other Democrats on stage, who included such stars of the left as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders. “aoc, Bowman, Sanders: Shills for ‘Genocide Joe’ Biden!” read one sign. Even from inside the barricades, Mr Sanders drew some boos when he said Israel “had the right to defend itself against a terrorist attack” before adding, “It does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people.”\nMr Biden beat Donald Trump in New York in 2020 by 23 points, but a Siena College poll this month found Mr Biden leading by just eight. He and Democrats generally have lost favour with independent voters and others who do not affiliate with either major party, the state’s second-biggest bloc after Democrats. With six congressional seats in New York believed to be up for grabs—including five picked up by Republicans in 2022—Democrats are trying to reclaim the political centre. Mondaire Jones, a former congressman running in a district adjoining Mr Bowman’s, once advocated defunding the police, but recently told the Washington Post that was “one of the dumbest phrases ever to exist in American politics”. Mr Jones alienated former allies on the left by endorsing Mr Bowman’s opponent, George Latimer.\nThough Democrats’ lurch towards the centre in New York is unmistakable, Mr Bowman’s race is better understood as an indicator of the tensions building within the party than of how they will be resolved. Mr Bowman, a 48-year-old former school principal given to joyfully rapping in social-media posts, is the first member of the “Squad” of progressive legislators to lose a primary. He is black, and his defeat by a 70-year-old white moderate endorsed by the likes of Hillary Clinton might be read as a sign that the establishment is back in control. But Mr Latimer was a formidable candidate with a long record of service as a local elected official, and Mr Bowman, who first won his congressional seat in 2020, was particularly vulnerable.\nMr Bowman went well beyond criticising Israel’s war in Gaza—a mainstream Democratic position—to dismissing reports of rape by Hamas as “propaganda”. He apologised for that, but as recently as the final debate of the primary he accused Israel of “75 years of military occupation”, a view questioning the legitimacy of the state itself. He had troubles apart from the politics of Israel.  It emerged in the campaign that in years past he indulged in conspiracy theories about the attacks of September 11th and other subjects. He was caught on video last year pulling a fire alarm in a House office building, prompting an evacuation before a vote on a funding bill, and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour. He could be tone deaf to the politics of his district, mostly composed of suburbs of New York City. “We’re gonna show fuckin’ aipac the power of the motherfuckin’ South Bronx!” he roared on Saturday—a vow that might have jarred his constituents not merely for its profanity but also because the South Bronx is not in their district.\nThe role of aipac in the race also complicates its lessons. The group’s political arm spent more than $14.5m helping Mr Latimer, the most ever spent by an interest group on a House race, but not by emphasising Mr Bowman’s views on Israel. Instead, its ads portrayed him as undermining Mr Biden by, for example, voting against his infrastructure bill.\nDonald Trump, unifier\nBecause aipac’s donors include Republican billionaires, Mr Bowman charged that “Republican racist maga Trump money” was trying to buy the district for Mr Latimer. Indeed, to some on the left, how Mr Bowman lost is a sign they are winning the larger struggle. As Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, a political action committee, argues, “It shows how weak the establishment and aipac are that they have to resort to breaking records alongside Republican billionaires to advance their interests.” For its part aipac is already boosting the primary opponent of another vulnerable member of the Squad, Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri, whose contest is in August.\nFar more than admiration for Mr Biden, antipathy to Donald Trump is holding the Democratic Party together. That may prove enough to turn out progressives to vote again for the president this autumn. But whoever wins, any polite silence within the party will end after November, and a great, noisy struggle will begin over whether the likes of Mr Bowman, or of Mr Latimer, should represent its future. ■\nStay on top of American politics with The us in brief, our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and Checks and Balance, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.",

        "body": "A\nround nine o’clock in the morning, a tap would come at his window. Outside his house in St Nicholas Place in Harlem milled a group of grinning boys. They carried mop-handles and a pink bouncing ball, all the equipment they needed. The street and the parked cars would provide the rest. What they wanted was to play stickball, and he was only too eager to join them. He’d play for an hour, morning or evening, as his job allowed. Soon he was crouching, swinging the stick, just an ordinary man in a Polo shirt and trousers. But when he made contact he whacked the ball so hard that it went for three or four sewers, or three or four city blocks. Because, after all, he was Willie Mays, then the star of the New York Giants.\nPlaying stickball taught him how to hit curveballs. You never knew how the surface of the street might skew that high, wild bounce. Apart from that, though, he did not have much to learn. His father, nicknamed “Cat” for his slinky prowess on the field, had played baseball between jobs down near Birmingham, Alabama. It was he who taught him how to be a centre fielder and to stick with the game. At 16, playing practically barefooted, he already knew exactly what he had to do. His body was built for baseball, strong, sinewy and graceful, like his Dad’s. He could hit a ball out of the park, defend, outsmart anyone and catch mostly anything. Easy. That happy certainty lasted years.\nThe statistics followed. Over his 22-year Major League career—six years with the Giants in New York, 15 more when they moved west in 1958 to become the San Francisco Giants, two with the New York Mets—he stacked up 3,293 hits, 660 home runs, 339 steals, a .301 batting average, two National League Most Valuable Player awards and 12 Gold Gloves. Ten of those hits, all that were recorded, were added in 2024 from his time in 1948-50 with the Birmingham Black Barons in the segregated Negro League. He could have scored even higher without army service, which he mostly spent playing baseball anyway to entertain the troops.\nEntertainment was the thing. Statistics didn’t lodge in his brain. Besides, a few other players surpassed him in the numbers game, and it never mattered as much as the way he played, with sheer joy. His philosophy was “They throw the ball, I hit it; they hit the ball, I catch it.” If he did that as well as he could, he could lead by example, and make the people around him play better. When younger players asked him for advice, as they often did, he would tell them first to enjoy themselves. He didn’t smoke, drink or fool around with women, because baseball was the most fun he could think of. His pink Lincoln Continental and his smile said it all. He also had ways of making his job even more fun for fans: breaking late on a ball, to bait a runner, before speeding up at just the right time; stealing bases on the riskiest dare, in heroic explosions of dust; and wearing a cap one size too small for him, which at exciting moments would blow right off his head.\nIt blew off, predictably, in his best play of all, in the 1954 World Series when the Giants were facing the Cleveland Indians. Vic Wertz of Cleveland powered the ball to the back of the ground, 460 feet or so, and Willie Mays ran, raced, and right at the wall snagged it with one of his famous basket catches over his left shoulder. It was known ever after as “The Catch”, and brought the crowd to its feet. But he knew he had made better ones than that. For a start, he was sure he would get it. (He often had a strange sort of premonition about that. Lying down at night, watching tv, suddenly a flyball would come out to him, and he’d know how to deal with it. The next day he would recognise that very ball, because he had seen it the night before.) But second, where The Catch was concerned, that was not the most important bit of the play. The vital part was to instantly do a 360, whirl around (cap off) and hurl the ball to the infield, so the runners at the bases couldn’t score. He did it, and the Giants won the Series. Now, that was truly great.\nBeing lighthearted was not always easy. When he signed for the New York Giants in 1950 he went initially to Trenton, New Jersey, in the Interstate League. From being a happy teenager in the Birmingham Black Barons, where they were all brothers and everyone took care of him, he was suddenly the only black player around. As he moved higher, too, the pitching got fiercer. And he knew no one; his nickname, “The Say Hey Kid”, came from his clumsy attempts to break in and make friends. In the smaller towns people said openly that they didn’t like him playing. But he had a neat answer for that: if they mocked him, he’d hit the ball further. After a few nights of that, they would be applauding him.\nRacism followed him, sadly, to the west coast. Two things surprised him about San Francisco. First, how cold and windy Candlestick Park was, so much so that he had to rub himself with hot oil before he played. But second, that he could not buy a house in elegant Sherwood Forest because the white neighbours objected. They backed down, but after two years he moved 3,000 miles to the east coast, just north of New York. The city had always welcomed him with open arms. So though he did not like to be traded, he was content to end his career there with the New York Mets.\nHe hardly ever spoke out about civil rights. Off the field he was shy, and it wasn’t his thing. Other black baseball greats, especially Hank Aaron and Jackie Robinson, criticised him for that. But in Alabama he had learned to keep his head down and his mouth shut. His way of joining in the fight when he retired was again to lead by example, this time by giving his money away. He gave his dentist $12,000 for a new chair, a young woman $10,000 to clear her credit-card debts, and set up the Say Hey Foundation to do what he could for underprivileged youngsters. This, he wanted to say, was how black folk responded to prejudice. Whether by good works or by playing ball, they changed hatred to joy. ■",
