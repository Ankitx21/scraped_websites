        "body_text": "The digital health startup market is recovering after a tough 2023.\nThe first half of this year has been characterized by smaller but more frequent venture capital (VC) deals, more early-stage deals, and a thawing IPO market, according to a report from digital health strategy group and venture fund Rock Health.\nOverall, US digital health startups raised $5.7 billion in the first half of the year, Rock Health researchers found. While that\u2019s slightly less than the first half of 2023 ($6.1 billion), the number of deals closed is on the uptick, with 266 closing in H1 2024 compared to 244 in 2023.\nIf dealmaking continues at the same pace, Rock Health analysts expect digital health startups could raise more money and close more deals this year than they did in both 2023 and 2019, which is the year before VC investing skyrocketed during the pandemic.\n\u201cFunding momentum (especially at the early stage) and the tapering of transition measures like unlabeled rounds hint that we might be returning to more \u2018normal,\u2019 sustainable venture patterns,\u201d Rock Health researchers wrote in the report.\nThe earlier the better: The report shows that most of the deals closed in the first half of this year (84%) have been early-stage deals.\nSome large Series A raises include Zephyr AI, an artificial intelligence (AI) precision medicine startup, which closed a $111 million deal in March with funding from investors including Eli Lilly and Epiq Capital Group, and biosensor startup Allez Health, closing a $60 million Series A+ deal in May led by Korean in vitro diagnostics company Osang Healthcare.\nMore Stories\nSTARTUPS\nPrivate equity-owned healthcare companies increasingly going bankrupt, report finds\nDIRECT CARE\nHere\u2019s what healthcare leaders expect for the rest of 2024\nDIRECT CARE\nWellhatched founder Holly Singh discusses the day-to-day of running a fertility startup\nAI-focused digital health startups continued to get a lot of VC attention in the first six months of 2024\u201438% of those that raised Series A rounds deal with the tech\u2014according to Rock Health researchers. Plus, 34% of the overall dollars invested in digital health in H1 2024 went to AI-based startups.\nOverall, the most popular firms capturing VC dollars in the first half of the year, per the report, were those focused on treating a specific disease or related to mental health.\nNavigate the healthcare industry\nHealthcare Brew covers pharmaceutical developments, health startups, the latest tech, and how it impacts hospitals and providers to keep administrators and providers informed.\nSubscribe\nAnother popular feature of digital health startup deals for the last several quarters has been unlabeled deals (meaning companies aren\u2019t attaching a name like Series A or B to the funding round).\n\u201cUnlabeled rounds tend to spike during periods of transition between market conditions, when startups need access to capital but don\u2019t meet benchmarks for their next labeled raise and/or are trying to delay tough conversations on topics like valuation,\u201d researchers wrote in the report.\nBut the prevalence of these special rounds is starting to fade as the deal market stabilizes and startups aren\u2019t as strapped for cash. In the first half of 2024, 40% of deals were unlabeled, compared to 48% in Q1 2024 and 44% during 2023, as Healthcare Brew previously reported.\nThe number of unlabeled rounds is still much higher than in previous years (7% in 2020 and 4% in 2019), but the researchers said the slowdown \u201ccould mark the beginning of our return to a \u2018more normal\u2019 cadence of labeled raises.\u201d\nComeback kid? Digital health startups are also (slowly) returning to the IPO market. After a quiet year of no digital health IPOs in 2023, three startups went public in Q2 2024: Nuvo, a remote fetal monitoring platform; Waystar, a healthcare revenue cycle management company; and Tempus AI, an AI-based precision medicine company.\nPrivate equity firms have also taken an increased liking to digital health startup acquisitions, Rock Health researchers noted; PE firms scooped up 10 digital health startups in the first half of the year\u2014more than in all of 2023.\nThe researchers noted, however, that there\u2019s still much uncertainty over how the digital health market will perform in light of the presidential election and as retailers like Walmart sell off their digital health capabilities."

        "body_text": "Welcome to Making Rounds, where we spotlight voices from across the healthcare industry. Want to be featured in an upcoming edition? Click here to introduce yourself.\nThis edition of Making Rounds spotlights Neil Batlivala, co-founder and CEO of Pair Team, a startup that works to connect underserved communities to healthcare services. Batlivala talked with Healthcare Brew about how Pair Team partners with nonprofits, what healthcare services the team provides, and how the company\u2019s business model works.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nWhat does Pair Team do?\nWe build telemedicine clinics on-site at nonprofits. We go to housing providers\u2014like shelters or transitional or adult-living facilities\u2014we go to food pantries; we go to sobering centers. And we help bring clinical capabilities to these more underserved communities to help connect them to high-quality care.\nHow we do that is a combination of upskilling and workforce development. We actually train the staff at our nonprofit partners to provide the services. This gives them a new revenue stream, so it can be very impactful from not just a mission perspective to provide more services to clients, but also to give them access to what we call an earned revenue model\u2026and then we equip them with [things] like an iPad for telemedicine services, wireless blood pressure cuffs, glucometers, weighted scales.\nWe\u2019re focused initially right now in California. We\u2019re close to 140, 150 [employees]. A bulk of the workforce is the care team\u2026community health workers, nurse practitioners, primary care providers, licensed clinical social workers, registered nurses.\nWhat kind of healthcare services do you help nonprofits provide?\nFull comprehensive primary care and preventative care services. We do clinical, behavioral, and we\u2019ll also do social support coordination services. If we work with one of the clients at a housing provider, we can get people an annual wellness visit, help them get mental health check-ins with a behavioral health therapist. But then we\u2019ll also be able to help them coordinate for rental assistance if they\u2019re trying to graduate from the program\u2026we view clinical, behavioral, and social care all together.\nMore Stories\nSTARTUPS\nDigital health startups are closing more deals with smaller check sizes\nDIRECT CARE\nHere\u2019s what healthcare leaders expect for the rest of 2024\nDIRECT CARE\nFewer US adults put off seeking medical care due to cost during Covid, study finds\n[We work with] north of about 60 [nonprofits]\u2026and more than 3,000 high-needs patients. So these are folks suffering from homelessness, severe mental illness, substance use, those recently transitioning from incarceration.\nNavigate the healthcare industry\nHealthcare Brew covers pharmaceutical developments, health startups, the latest tech, and how it impacts hospitals and providers to keep administrators and providers informed.\nSubscribe\nHow does your business model work?\nIt turns out that there are a lot of individuals on Medicaid who don\u2019t have the luxury of thinking about their health as much as they should be, just because there\u2019s so much else going on. They\u2019re a single mom who\u2019s trying to think about, \u201cWhere am I going to sleep? How am I going to go pick up my kids?\u201d Because of that, when health issues come up, they go to the emergency room in the hospital. They let issues build up, build up, build up, until they end up in hospital\u2014which is very costly to the health plan. What the health plans do is they partner with us because we\u2019re saying, \u201cHey, if we can get preventative care services to these individuals prior to that hospitalization, prior to that emergency department visit, prior to that urgent care visit, it\u2019s actually more cost-effective.\u201d It\u2019s kind of a win-win. It\u2019s more cost-effective for the individual to get that preventative care.\nSo your model is essentially saving money for health plans?\nExactly."

        "body_text": "In a move that some analysts say may signal the return of the initial public offering (IPO) to the digital health market, revenue cycle management company Waystar said in a May 28 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it will seek a public exit that could raise up to $1 billion.\nThe digital health market has had a tough year, with no IPOs in all of 2023. Comparatively, the industry saw roughly 20 public exits in 2021. The recent slowdown in the broader IPO market is linked to several trends, including high interest rates and some high-profile bankruptcies, according to Adriana Krasniansky, head of research at digital health strategy group and venture fund Rock Health\u2019s advisory arm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to go public in any sector, but it\u2019s been especially hard for companies in the digital health sector because they\u2019ve seen other digital health players have a hard time on the public markets,\u201d Krasniansky told Healthcare Brew\nSo, why now? There are a few factors at play that set the stage for Waystar to IPO now, Krasniansky said.\nFor one, the overall IPO market beyond digital health is starting to thaw, according to Krasniansky and other investment strategists.\nAlso, some late-stage digital health companies are facing pressure to exit in some way from investors and employees looking for a liquidity event, whether that\u2019s an IPO or another type of public exit like a merger or acquisition, Krasniansky said.\nThird, there are some digital health companies on the public market that are doing well and setting a positive example.\n\u201c[Those companies] have really found their footing when it comes to reporting quarterly and managing their guidance, so there\u2019s probably a stronger\u2026peer set that some of these players can look for to better see what they should expect,\u201d Krasniansky said. \u201cNow, you have a little bit more foresight into what things might look like for you because you have some of these proxies or peers in the market.\u201d\nMore Stories\nSTARTUPS\nDigital health startups are closing more deals with smaller check sizes\nDIRECT CARE\nSteward is under federal investigation over alleged fraud\nDIRECT CARE\nFewer US adults put off seeking medical care due to cost during Covid, study finds\nLastly, going public opens a company up to new investors, which is important at a time when the cost of capital in the private markets is high and investors are spending more conservatively, Krasniansky added.\nNavigate the healthcare industry\nHealthcare Brew covers pharmaceutical developments, health startups, the latest tech, and how it impacts hospitals and providers to keep administrators and providers informed.\nSubscribe\n\u201cEspecially for some companies that are more private equity-backed, or those that have high debt burdens, it could be pretty interesting for them to go public as a way to broaden their access to different investors or a broader class of investors,\u201d she said.\nLooking ahead: Waystar\u2019s IPO could inspire others to take their shot at going public, but it\u2019s going to take roughly a quarter to really tell, according to Krasniansky.\n\u201cGoing public sometimes can be a decision that\u2019s inspired by other companies doing so, but it\u2019s also a very individual decision for each company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to compare apples to apples, and say because one or two digital health companies are going public that more will follow.\u201d\nThere has already been some momentum in the digital health market this quarter. While Waystar is the largest digital health IPO of 2024, it\u2019s not the first. Tempus AI, a precision medicine company, filed to go public on May 20 and reportedly plans to raise up to $100 million, though the company didn\u2019t disclose pricing terms in its SEC filing.\nWhether or not Waystar\u2019s IPO will make venture capitalists more comfortable investing in the digital health space remains \u201cthe million-dollar question,\u201d according to Krasniansky.\n\u201cIf the IPO market were to open a bit more or thaw a bit more, there may be conversations that begin again about many of these late-stage players exiting publicly,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s still important to remember that\u2026several digital health companies left the public markets in the past several quarters.\u201d\nMoving forward, Krasniansky said she hopes digital health companies will take \u201creally measured steps\u2026about exiting onto the public markets, because the public market comes with a lot of responsibility.\u201d"

That makes companies \u201cmore vulnerable to changing market conditions, including high interest rates and rising labor costs,\u201d she wrote.\nInterest rates increased 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 (from 0.25% to 5.5%), according to PESP.\nHealthcare companies have also faced rising labor costs and staffing shortages, and many have relied on more expensive contract labor, which compounds financial challenges, O\u2019Grady noted.\nSome PE firms have seen multiple healthcare company bankruptcies in recent years. KKR, one of the largest publicly traded PE firms, owned both staffing firm Envision Healthcare and cancer care provider GenesisCare\u2014both of which filed for bankruptcy in 2023, according to PESP. The firm still owns three other healthcare companies with a high risk of default, O\u2019Grady wrote.\nThe PE-owned bankruptcy trend is expected to continue, according to PESP.\n\u201cAnother wave of PE-driven healthcare bankruptcies is expected in 2024\u2014almost all [93%] of the most distressed US healthcare companies are owned by PE firms,\u201d O\u2019Grady wrote in the report.\nThe consequences of a healthcare company bankruptcy are more than just financial. It can cause a lack of healthcare access and lead to overburdened providers, according to PESP.\n\u201cThe rise in bankruptcies raises questions about how the private equity business model creates risk for the healthcare system,\u201d O\u2019Grady wrote. \u201cPrivate equity\u2019s heavy use of debt to fund its healthcare investments is becoming a major liability for its portfolio companies as interest rates have risen and remained elevated and labor costs for many healthcare companies have skyrocketed.\u201d"

Total funding for digital health startups was $2.7 billion, the lowest level since 2019.\nAn increase in the frequency of deals\u2014even if they\u2019re smaller\u2014is a good sign, according to Krasniansky.\n\u201cThat means that investors and founders are coming to conclusions and decisions and are making funding moves,\u201d she said.\nInvestors are starting to look at different metrics\u2014proven outcomes and healthy margins\u2014when deciding which startups to put money into, rather than factors like projected growth rates, Rock Health researchers found.\n\u201cI think what [that] really tells us is [investors are] looking for companies that work now, not companies that work in the future,\u201d Krasniansky said. \u201cThere\u2019s less leeway for companies to point to a future path to profitability or point to a future outcome\u2026There needs to be those signals of both healthy business model and efficacious product now.\u201d\nMore Stories\nSTARTUPS\nPrivate equity-owned healthcare companies increasingly going bankrupt, report finds\nPAYERS\nWhat CMS\u2019s proposed reimbursement codes could mean for the digital therapeutics industry\nDIRECT CARE\nUS News shares annual best hospitals list\nA significant percentage (40%) of the digital health startups that closed deals in Q1 were artificial intelligence (AI)-focused, Rock Health researchers noted.

Zephyr AI, an AI-focused precision medicine company, raised $111 million in a Series A round in March, and Ambience Healthcare, an AI-powered startup that created what it calls an \u201coperating system for healthcare,\u201d raised $70 million in February.\nNavigate the healthcare industry\nHealthcare Brew covers pharmaceutical developments, health startups, the latest tech, and how it impacts hospitals and providers to keep administrators and providers informed.\nSubscribe\nMany startups that closed deals in Q1 also opted for unlabeled funding rounds, which are those that aren\u2019t attached to a label like Series A, B, C, etc. Of all the deals closed in Q1, 48% were unlabeled, compared to 44% for all of 2023, Rock Health researchers found.\nKrasniansky said it\u2019s not always clear why startups choose to do an unlabeled round, but that the rounds can indicate \u201creally positive things, like an investor wants to add on to a prior round.\u201d\nAn uptick in unlabeled rounds also shows that there\u2019s more flexibility in dealmaking, she added.\nThe digital health landscape has also changed since several companies have gotten delisted from the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, the Rock Health report noted. Three companies\u2014Science 37, Better Therapeutics, and Veradigm\u2014were delisted in Q1 2024. Another nine companies have been delisted since 2022, and six more are at risk of delisting, according to Rock Health.\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching a big change moment for not only digital health\u2019s publicly traded cohort but for the entire cohort of companies that have been considering going public,\u201d Krasniansky said. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in what the changes in the public market ultimately mean for private market activity.
