            "I don’t like to “wing” travel — to say I’m a planner is a bit of an understatement. If I’m being totally honest, I might enjoy the preparation part as much as the trip itself. Whether you’re like me and enjoy the process or only put in the work so that the vacation itself is incredible, it’s necessary to do some research ahead of time. And if you’re going to travel this summer, chances are you’re somewhere in the planning phase — and there are a few AI-powered tools that can help.1. Ask Gemini to be your travel prep assistantThe first step in planning summer travel is deciding what that travel should look like, starting with your destination, how to get there and when exactly to go. This can be daunting, but Gemini can help you figure out what you’re looking for, whether it’s a road trip across the country ASAP, backpacking somewhere remote in a month or hanging at the local beach to end summer on a good note. Try asking Gemini things like:Tell me about some of the most popular summer vacation destinations.Is July a good time to visit Tokyo?When is the best time to book flights to Europe?Once you nail down the broad strokes of your vacation, then you can ask Gemini to help you get more specific — try asking things like:Start a trip planning doc for me and friends, we're visiting Ireland for a week and want to do a roadtrip.I’d like to do a staycation for the 4th of July weekend. What mid-priced hotels have the best ratings for a staycation near me?Let’s pretend you’re my travel agent. Help me plan a trip to the Bahamas. I’m looking for a nice hotel with 4+ stars, flights that leave Los Angeles around 10 a.m. and restaurants near the airport.And then, finally, you can ask Gemini to help with some logistics. For example:Draft a packing list for my weekend fishing and camping trip.Compile a list of ways I can save money on hotels.Give me the confirmation code for my upcoming flight to Miami. Check @Gmail.",
            "2. Use Google Lens or Circle to Search to turn inspo into informationSometimes when you’re really at vacation planning square one, all you’ve got are inspo pics. Instead of just treating those as a travel vision board, you can use Google Lens to get more information about them. For example, if you came across a photo of a beautiful view from what looks like the top of a hike but don’t know where it is, you don’t have to spend time trying to dig it up: Just search it with Google Lens and get the information you need. On select Android devices, you can also use Circle to Search to learn about whatever you see on your phone — without needing to switch apps. Maybe you come across just the carry-on backpack you’ve been looking for in your social feed. With Circle to Search, you can use a simple gesture to select whatever catches your eye and get results from across the web — including easy options for where to buy. Plus, with multisearch on Lens and Circle to Search, you can add text to your visual query to get more specific results, like finding the perfect travel backpack in your favorite color.3. Find places to go with Google Maps highlightsGoogle Maps is a traveler’s best friend, and using its lists feature to prepare for an upcoming trip is incredibly handy. That way you’ll have a collection of spots you’ve already researched along with instant access to directions so you don’t waste any time looking up somewhere to have dinner, grab coffee or even do some much-needed laundry while you’re on vacay. A great way to research places ahead of your trip is by using an AI-powered Maps feature that combines key insights from photos and reviews shared by the Maps community with information shared by businesses to help you quickly identify a place’s highlights. All you have to do is click on a location on Maps and you’ll see helpful details at a glance — like what people like about it, the cost and popularity of certain dishes at a restaurant and even more obscure things like what the vibe of a place is like — so you can decide whether a spot makes it to your list or not.4. Preview potential routes with Immersive ViewLike I said: Google Maps is a traveler’s best friend! Another excellent way to plan your travels is to get a realistic feel for a place using Immersive View. Immersive View uses AI and computer vision to analyze a vast amount of Street View data and other imagery to understand, identify and eventually transform 2D images into 3D models you can explore. So while you’re planning your summer trip, you can use Immersive View (which is currently available in over 50 cities worldwide including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Dublin, Florence, Las Vegas, London, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Paris, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Tokyo, Venice and expanding) to get an idea of how walkable a particular location is, figure out how tricky parking might be or see whether there are restaurants nearby — helpful details when you’re trying to decide between different areas of a town to stay in.5. Organize travel prep with Gemini for Google WorkspaceGoogle One AI Premium subscribers have access to Gemini in Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more, effectively supercharging how you use these tools for pre-travel tasks. I am a huge proponent of using Workspace for this purpose — I’ve got thorough Docs and Sheets for every vacation I’ve taken within the past 10 years. And now generative AI features make it even easier and faster to collect and act on your trip-planning information; for example, use Help me write in Docs and ask Gemini to create a to-do or packing list. Or if you’re sharing a Doc with a group you’ll be traveling with and notice that someone’s dumped a ton of ideas into it but it’s disorganized, you can ask Gemini to summarize or bulletize it for you. Then get ultra-organized with Sheets, where you can ask Gemini to make you a table that has the arrivals, departures, locations and airline details for your flights — then add a tab and ask Gemini to create a budget table or a daily itinerary, featuring whatever information you’ll find most useful. If you’re like me, then you might have a tab or two or three or four to add. What can I say? I like to be prepared!"

            "A couple of weeks ago at Google I/O, we announced that we’d be bringing AI Overviews to everyone in the U.S.User feedback shows that with AI Overviews, people have higher satisfaction with their search results, and they’re asking longer, more complex questions that they know Google can now help with. They use AI Overviews as a jumping off point to visit web content, and we see that the clicks to webpages are higher quality — people are more likely to stay on that page, because we’ve done a better job of finding the right info and helpful webpages for them.In the last week, people on social media have shared some odd and erroneous overviews (along with a very large number of faked screenshots). We know that people trust Google Search to provide accurate information, and they’ve never been shy about pointing out oddities or errors when they come across them — in our rankings or in other Search features. We hold ourselves to a high standard, as do our users, so we expect and appreciate the feedback, and take it seriously.Given the attention AI Overviews received, we wanted to explain what happened and the steps we’ve taken.How AI Overviews workFor many years we’ve built features in Search that make it easier for people to find the information they’re looking for as quickly as possible. AI Overviews are designed to take that a step further, helping with more complex questions that might have previously taken multiple searches or follow-ups, while prominently including links to learn more.AI Overviews work very differently than chatbots and other LLM products that people may have tried out. They’re not simply generating an output based on training data. While AI Overviews are powered by a customized language model, the model is integrated with our core web ranking systems and designed to carry out traditional “search” tasks, like identifying relevant, high-quality results from our index. That’s why AI Overviews don’t just provide text output, but include relevant links so people can explore further. Because accuracy is paramount in Search, AI Overviews are built to only show information that is backed up by top web results.This means that AI Overviews generally don't “hallucinate” or make things up in the ways that other LLM products might. When AI Overviews get it wrong, it’s usually for other reasons: misinterpreting queries, misinterpreting a nuance of language on the web, or not having a lot of great information available. (These are challenges that occur with other Search features too.)This approach is highly effective. Overall, our tests show that our accuracy rate for AI Overviews is on par with another popular feature in Search — featured snippets — which also uses AI systems to identify and show key info with links to web content.About those odd resultsIn addition to designing AI Overviews to optimize for accuracy, we tested the feature extensively before launch. This included robust red-teaming efforts, evaluations with samples of typical user queries and tests on a proportion of search traffic to see how it performed. But there’s nothing quite like having millions of people using the feature with many novel searches. We’ve also seen nonsensical new searches, seemingly aimed at producing erroneous results.Separately, there have been a large number of faked screenshots shared widely. Some of these faked results have been obvious and silly. Others have implied that we returned dangerous results for topics like leaving dogs in cars, smoking while pregnant, and depression. Those AI Overviews never appeared. So we’d encourage anyone encountering these screenshots to do a search themselves to check.But some odd, inaccurate or unhelpful AI Overviews certainly did show up. And while these were generally for queries that people don’t commonly do, it highlighted some specific areas that we needed to improve.One area we identified was our ability to interpret nonsensical queries and satirical content. Let’s take a look at an example: “How many rocks should I eat?” Prior to these screenshots going viral, practically no one asked Google that question. You can see that yourself on Google Trends.There isn't much web content that seriously contemplates that question, either. This is what is often called a “data void” or “information gap,” where there’s a limited amount of high quality content about a topic. However, in this case, there is satirical content on this topic … that also happened to be republished on a geological software provider’s website. So when someone put that question into Search, an AI Overview appeared that faithfully linked to one of the only websites that tackled the question.In other examples, we saw AI Overviews that featured sarcastic or troll-y content from discussion forums. Forums are often a great source of authentic, first-hand information, but in some cases can lead to less-than-helpful advice, like using glue to get cheese to stick to pizza.In a small number of cases, we have seen AI Overviews misinterpret language on webpages and present inaccurate information. We worked quickly to address these issues, either through improvements to our algorithms or through established processes to remove responses that don't comply with our policies.Improvements we've madeAs is always the case when we make improvements to Search, we don’t simply “fix” queries one by one, but we work on updates that can help broad sets of queries, including new ones that we haven’t seen yet.From looking at examples from the past couple of weeks, we were able to determine patterns where we didn’t get it right, and we made more than a dozen technical improvements to our systems. Here’s a sample of what we’ve done so far:We built better detection mechanisms for nonsensical queries that shouldn’t show an AI Overview, and limited the inclusion of satire and humor content.We updated our systems to limit the use of user-generated content in responses that could offer misleading advice.We added triggering restrictions for queries where AI Overviews were not proving to be as helpful.For topics like news and health, we already have strong guardrails in place. For example, we aim to not show AI Overviews for hard news topics, where freshness and factuality are important. In the case of health, we launched additional triggering refinements to enhance our quality protections.In addition to these improvements, we’ve been vigilant in monitoring feedback and external reports, and taking action on the small number of AI Overviews that violate content policies. This means overviews that contain information that’s potentially harmful, obscene, or otherwise violative. We found a content policy violation on less than one in every 7 million unique queries on which AI Overviews appeared.At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors. We’ve learned a lot over the past 25 years about how to build and maintain a high-quality search experience, including how to learn from these errors to make Search better for everyone. We’ll keep improving when and how we show AI Overviews and strengthening our protections, including for edge cases, and we’re very grateful for the ongoing feedback."

            "Over the past 25 years, across many technological shifts, we’ve continued to reimagine and expand what Google Search can do. We’ve meticulously honed our core information quality systems to help you find the best of what’s on the web. And we’ve built a knowledge base of billions of facts about people, places and things — all so you can get information you can trust in the blink of an eye.Now, with generative AI, Search can do more than you ever imagined. So you can ask whatever’s on your mind or whatever you need to get done — from researching to planning to brainstorming — and Google will take care of the legwork.This is all made possible by a new Gemini model customized for Google Search. It brings together Gemini’s advanced capabilities — including multi-step reasoning, planning and multimodality — with our best-in-class Search systems.Get quick answers with AI OverviewsSometimes you want a quick answer, but you don’t have time to piece together all the information you need. Search will do the work for you with AI Overviews.People have already used AI Overviews billions of times through our experiment in Search Labs. They like that they can get both a quick overview of a topic and links to learn more. We’ve found that with AI Overviews, people use Search more, and are more satisfied with their results.So today, AI Overviews will begin rolling out to everyone in the U.S., with more countries coming soon. That means that this week, hundreds of millions of users will have access to AI Overviews, and we expect to bring them to over a billion people by the end of the year.",
            "With AI Overviews, people are visiting a greater diversity of websites for help with more complex questions. And we see that the links included in AI Overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query. As we expand this experience, we’ll continue to focus on sending valuable traffic to publishers and creators. As always, ads will continue to appear in dedicated slots throughout the page, with clear labeling to distinguish between organic and sponsored results.Adjust your AI OverviewSoon, you’ll be able to adjust your AI Overview with options to simplify the language or break it down in more detail. This can be particularly useful if you’re new to a topic, or if you’re trying to simplify something to satisfy your kid’s curiosity.",

Rather than breaking your question into multiple searches, you can ask your most complex questions, with all the nuances and caveats you have in mind, all in one go.For example, maybe you’re looking for a new yoga or pilates studio, and you want one that’s popular with locals, conveniently located for your commute, and also offers a discount for new members. Soon, with just one search, you’ll be able to ask something like “find the best yoga or pilates studios in Boston and show me details on their intro offers, and walking time from Beacon Hill.”",
            "These multi-step reasoning capabilities are coming soon to AI Overviews in Search Labs, for English queries in the U.S.Plan aheadBeyond finding the right answer or information for a complex question, Search will also be able to plan with you.With planning capabilities directly in Search, you can get help creating plans for whatever you need, starting with meals and vacations. Search for something like “create a 3 day meal plan for a group that’s easy to prepare,” and you’ll get a starting point with a wide range of recipes from across the web.",
            "If you want to change anything, you can easily ask for whatever adjustments you need, like swapping dinner to a vegetarian dish. Just like that, Search will customize your meal plan. You’ll be able to quickly export your meal plan to Docs or Gmail.Meal and trip planning are available now in Search Labs in English in the U.S. Later this year, we’ll add customization capabilities and more categories like parties, date night and workouts.Explore an AI-organized results pageWhen you’re looking for fresh ideas, it can take a lot of work to find inspiration and consider all your options.

            "Attention travelers: Summer is right around the corner — which means summer vacation is, too. So today we’re sharing six ways Google tools can help you prepare for and make the most of your next trip.1. Get trip ideas with generative AI in SearchExploring a new place is one of the best parts of traveling. But uncovering the best spots to visit (or stay, or eat) can be difficult or time-consuming. So just ahead of the summer travel season, we’re testing new, AI-powered capabilities in Search that can do some of the heavy lifting for you.Now, if you’re opted into Search Generative Experience (SGE) and you ask something like “plan me a 3 day trip to Philadelphia that's all about history,” you’ll get a set of suggestions that includes attractions and restaurants, plus an overview of your flight and hotel options.",
            "These itineraries will bring together a range of ideas from sites across the web, as well as information like reviews, photos and other Business Profile details that people have submitted to Google for more than 200 million places around the world.With all of these links and resources organized in one place, it’s easy to dig deeper and learn more about your destination or compare different options. And when you’re ready, you can quickly export your trip ideas to Gmail, Docs or Maps to keep tweaking or share with your travel companions.This capability is available in English in the U.S. — just enroll in Search Labs and enable SGE to try it out. As with everything in Search Labs, this functionality is experimental. So as you research these trip ideas, share your feedback with a quick thumbs up or down.2. Find lists of recommendations in MapsIf you prefer to do a bit more hands-on research, we’re making it easier to discover lists of recommendations right in Google Maps — from sites you love and in-the-know locals.Starting in select cities in the U.S. and Canada, if you search for a city in Maps, you’ll now see lists of recommendations for places to go from both publishers — like The Infatuation — as well as members of the Maps community. We’re also introducing trending, top and hidden gem restaurant lists created by Google Maps, based on what people are interested in or loving in that city.",
            "3. Create even more customized lists in MapsWe’re also adding new tools to help you customize lists you create, so you can easily organize your travel plans or share your favorite spots.When you create a list of places in Maps, you’ll be able to choose the order they appear. So you can organize them by top favorites or chronologically like an itinerary — tailoring your list based on whatever you need.",
            "You’ll also be able to link to content from your social channels — like your review of the delicious meal you ate — for more context on why you saved that spot to your list.Both of these updates are coming to Google Maps on Android and iOS globally later this month.4. Curate your travel wardrobe with SearchPart of the fun of planning a trip is planning your outfits. Our new personalized style recommendations tool can help you easily discover more products you’ll like. When you search for apparel or accessories in the U.S. on mobile browsers or in the Google app — like “men’s polo shirts” — you’ll now see a section labeled “style recommendations.”You can quickly rate options with a thumbs up or down (or a swipe left or right), and get instant results with items that complement your vacation wardrobe. Not quite ready to buy? We’ll remember your preferences for next time to help you narrow down your options much faster.",
            "5. Translate your screen with Circle to Search, or what’s around you with LensIf you’re traveling somewhere and don’t know the local language, deciphering even basic information can be challenging. Maybe you’ve found a great restaurant to check out, but you need to translate the PDF menu on their website. Or perhaps you’re getting acquainted with local musicians on your favorite streaming app and want to understand their lyrics. Google Translate can help, but copying the text or switching to another app can take you out of your flow.Luckily, Circle to Search, available on select Android devices, will soon let you instantly translate whatever’s on your screen. Simply long press the home button or navigation bar and tap the translate icon.",
            "Translations in Circle to Search will start rolling out in the coming weeks. Circle to Search is currently accessible on Pixel 7+ devices and the Samsung Galaxy S24 series, in all languages and locations where they’re available. And starting this week, we’re rolling out Circle to Search to more Android phones, including foldables, and tablets.1Meanwhile, if you need to translate something around you, like a street sign or poster, Google Lens can step in to help. Just tap the Lens icon in the Google app and select the translate filter. Lens will automatically detect the source language and blend the translated text over the original.",
            "6. Use multisearch in Lens as your personal tour guideLens is also great for exploring the world around you, especially with the latest AI-powered upgrades to multisearch. Just point your camera, ask a question about what you see, and you’ll get helpful insights in an AI overview. Perhaps you’re at a museum and want to know more about a certain work of art. You can snap a photo, ask “why did the artist paint this?” and get a quick overview with the information you need, along with links to dive deeper. It’s almost like having a tour guide in your pocket.",
            "AI overviews on multisearch results are available in English in the U.S. for everyone — no enrollment in Search Labs required. To get started, look for the Lens camera icon in the Google app for Android or iOS."

            "People shop on Google more than a billion times a day.1 And thanks to the Shopping Graph, they see billions of products in their results — more than 45 billion,2 actually — that are constantly being refreshed. In fact, every hour, more than 2 billion listings are updated with the latest information, including pricing, in-stock availability and shipping details.3 So whether you’re looking for a specialty notepad from Japan, a monogrammed handbag from Paris or just a hammer from your local hardware store, the Shopping Graph can help you find it in just a few clicks.With that many options, we’re focused on making it easy to find exactly what you like. Here are a few ways you can have a more personalized shopping experience on Google.1. Rate styles to discover more of what you likeWe’ve started rolling out a new feature to help you get more personalized results in some of our most popular shopping categories. Starting with signed-in U.S. shoppers using mobile browsers and the Google app, when you search for certain apparel, shoes or accessories items — like “straw tote bags” or “men’s polo shirts” — you’ll see a section labeled “style recommendations.” There, you can rate options with a thumbs up or thumbs down, or a simple swipe right or left, and instantly see personalized results.If you haven’t quite found what you want (or you just want to keep going), we’ll give you the option to rate more items and instantly see another set of results. We’ll remember your preferences for next time, too. So when you’re looking for, say, men’s polo shirts again, you’ll see personalized style recommendations based on what you liked in the past and products you interacted with.If you made a mistake with your rating or don’t want to see personalized shopping results, you can easily manage your preferences: Just tap the three dots next to the \"Get style recommendations\" section and look for personalization options in the “About this result” panel.",
            "2. See more from your favorite brandsYou can also specify what brands you like. U.S. shoppers searching for apparel, shoes or accessories on mobile browsers, desktop or in the Google app can select brands they’d like to see more of while shopping with Google. Once you’ve selected them, you’ll see options from those brands right away. Tap the three dots next to the \"Popular from your favorite brands\" section and look for personalization options in the “About this result” panel to manage your preferences.",
            "3. Bring your vision to life with image generation20% of apparel shopping queries on Google have five words or more,4 which may mean that people have a very specific idea in mind when they’re shopping for clothes. Descriptions people use can also vary. For instance, someone might call something boxy, while another might call it oversized.We developed AI image generation for shopping so you can shop for apparel styles similar to whatever you had in mind. Say you want a new spring jacket, but haven’t found the right match. After searching for your query — like “colorful quilted spring jacket” — tap “Generate images” to see photorealistic images that match your vision. Once you’ve found one you like, just click it and scroll to see shoppable options. Anyone in the U.S. who has opted into Search Generative Experience (SGE) within Search Labs can access this experiment on the Google app or mobile browsers.",
            "4. Virtually try it onEven when you’ve found a style you like, you might want that extra assurance it’s going to look just right on you. That’s where our virtual try-on (VTO) tool comes into play. In the U.S. on desktop, mobile or the Google app, just look for the “try-on” icon in shopping results for men’s or women’s tops. You’ll see what that top looks like on a diverse set of real models ranging in size from XXS-4XL — including how it would drape, fold or form wrinkles and shadows on the model. VTO is also helpful for brands: After engaging with VTO imagery, shoppers are more likely to click out to retailers’ sites to potentially buy.5",
            "No two shoppers are alike, which is why we’re designing the shopping experience on Google so it’s tailored to you. Look out for more personalized experiences to help you find and shop for what you love."

            "Marketers face increasing complexity in measuring the full value of their cross-channel media strategies, driven largely by fragmented media consumption and ongoing privacy changes. As advertisers search for comprehensive and privacy-durable measurement solutions, Marketing Mix Models (MMMs) are experiencing a renaissance. MMMs are statistical analyses that help companies measure the holistic impact of cross-channel marketing on key outcomes like sales. According to a study with Kantar, 60% of US advertisers are currently using MMMs, and 58% of those not using these models are considering doing so in the future.1 We have observed more customers turning to MMMs, especially performance and full-funnel marketers.That’s why we’re increasing our investment in the future of MMMs. Today, we’re announcing Meridian, an open source MMM that empowers teams to build best-in-class MMMs and drive better business outcomes. It’s built to enable privacy-durable, advanced measurement while meeting marketers where they are. Meridian anchors on:Innovation: Meridian will include methodology innovations to help make MMMs more accurate, actionable and analytically rigorous. Innovations at launch include calibration with incrementality experiments, reach and frequency incorporation to link outcomes with planning, and guidance on measuring search. These innovations will be applicable to all media channels that can provide the necessary inputs. We will continue to develop new methodology innovations to help marketers modernize their measurement strategies and maximize MMM’s value in planning and budgeting.Transparency: By nature, as an open-sourced solution, Meridian will be completely transparent — anyone can evaluate the underlying code and methodology innovations. Meridian is designed to give the user control as any modeler is fully empowered to change the code and model parameters to meet their unique business needs. Think of Meridian as modeling clay: a starting point that allows users to iterate and develop further.Actionability: Meridian will help marketers make more informed decisions by providing richer data inputs, offering modeling guidance aligned to the innovations, and enabling cross-channel budget optimization. We will provide YouTube reach and frequency and indexed Google query-volume data on top of other Google data inputs for model building. Users of Meridian will be able to run scenario planning and budget optimizations to support future-looking cross-channel media allocation.Education: Meridian users will have access to a breadth of resources supporting implementation and use. We will provide comprehensive technical documentation, including a list of technical FAQs for troubleshooting. For some questions not addressed by existing documentation, users may have the opportunity to connect with Google and partner support for answers.According to Deloitte measurement research, C-Level leaders that placed high importance on Marketing Mix Modeling were over 2X more likely to exceed revenue goals by 10% or more.2MMMs today are not perfect, but are evolving. With Meridian, we look to help your team navigate toward your future North Star, both through innovation, and by sharing our data in conjunction with an open source model. We welcome everyone to join us in this effort.Meridian is currently offered in limited availability, with plans to offer general availability to all marketers and data scientists coming soon. You can sign up for and learn more about Meridian here."

        "article_paragraphs": [
            "Every day, people turn to Search to find the best of what the web has to offer. We’ve long had policies and automated systems to fight against spammers, and we work to address emerging tactics that look to game our results with low-quality content. We regularly update those policies and systems to effectively tackle these trends so we can continue delivering useful content and connecting people with high-quality websites.Today we’re announcing key changes we’re making to improve the quality of Search and the helpfulness of your results:Improved quality ranking: We’re making algorithmic enhancements to our core ranking systems to ensure we surface the most helpful information on the web and reduce unoriginal content in search results.New and improved spam policies: We’re updating our spam policies to keep the lowest-quality content out of Search, like expired websites repurposed as spam repositories by new owners and obituary spam.Reducing low-quality, unoriginal resultsIn 2022, we began tuning our ranking systems to reduce unhelpful, unoriginal content on Search and keep it at very low levels. We're bringing what we learned from that work into the March 2024 core update.This update involves refining some of our core ranking systems to help us better understand if webpages are unhelpful, have a poor user experience or feel like they were created for search engines instead of people. This could include sites created primarily to match very specific search queries.We believe these updates will reduce the amount of low-quality content on Search and send more traffic to helpful and high-quality sites. Based on our evaluations, we expect that the combination of this update and our previous efforts will collectively reduce low-quality, unoriginal content in search results by 40%.Update April 26, 2024: As of April 19, we’ve completed the rollout of these changes. You’ll now see 45% less low-quality, unoriginal content in search results versus the 40% improvement we expected across this work.Keeping more spam out of your resultsFor decades, we’ve relied on advanced spam-fighting systems and spam policies to prevent the lowest-quality content from appearing in search results — and that work continues.We’re making several updates to our spam policies to better address new and evolving abusive practices that lead to unoriginal, low-quality content showing up on Search. We’ll take action on more types of these manipulative behaviors starting today. While our ranking systems keep many types of low-quality content from ranking highly on Search, these updates allow us to take more targeted action under our spam policies.Scaled content abuseWe’ve long had a policy against using automation to generate low-quality or unoriginal content at scale with the goal of manipulating search rankings. This policy was originally designed to address instances of content being generated at scale where it was clear that automation was involved.Today, scaled content creation methods are more sophisticated, and whether content is created purely through automation isn't always as clear. To better address these techniques, we’re strengthening our policy to focus on this abusive behavior — producing content at scale to boost search ranking — whether automation, humans or a combination are involved. This will allow us to take action on more types of content with little to no value created at scale, like pages that pretend to have answers to popular searches but fail to deliver helpful content.Site reputation abuseSometimes, websites that have their own great content may also host low-quality content provided by third parties with the goal of capitalizing on the hosting site's strong reputation. For example, a third party might publish payday loan reviews on a trusted educational website to gain ranking benefits from the site. Such content ranking highly on Search can confuse or mislead visitors who may have vastly different expectations for the content on a given website.We’ll now consider very low-value, third-party content produced primarily for ranking purposes and without close oversight of a website owner to be spam. We're publishing this policy two months in advance of enforcement on May 5, to give site owners time to make any needed changes.Expired domain abuseOccasionally, expired domains are purchased and repurposed with the primary intention of boosting search ranking of low-quality or unoriginal content. This can mislead users into thinking the new content is part of the older site, which may not be the case. Expired domains that are purchased and repurposed with the intention of boosting the search ranking of low-quality content are now considered spam.Search helps people with billions of questions every day, but there will always be areas where we can improve. We’ll continue to work hard at keeping low-quality content on Search to low levels, and showing more information created to help people."

            "I personally find Valentine's Day to be one of the most daunting gift-giving holidays. I want to get something for my partner, of course, but I also like to let my friends and family (and even my dogs) know how much they’re loved. But it’s a tricky holiday: The perfect Valentine’s Day gift is sentimental but not saccharine-sweet. Genuinely useful but not overly practical. It has a personal touch — but could potentially be replicated for a friend or two (or three).If you also need a little help, here are six AI-powered Google tools for finding the perfect gift.1. Do your research with gen AI in SearchDon’t judge me, but I love my dogs more than anything and plan on giving them something this year beyond the treats or toys I might normally pick up — but I could use some extra help with ideas. That’s where Search Generative Experience (SGE), a generative AI experiment in Search Labs, comes in handy. It allows me to explore topics and get quick information , including ideas for shopping for moments like Valentine’s Day. I can search “Valentine’s Day gifts for my dog” to see categories and products to browse that fall under this concept — like heart-shaped dog treats or red and pink apparel for pups — plus links to learn more. I might even find unique ideas I might not have thought of, like a visit to a dog-friendly restaurant. To use gen AI in Search while you shop, opt-in to Search Labs in the Google app (Android and iOS) and on Chrome desktop.2. Make sure to check for dealsI’ve been thinking about getting my sister, who is into meditation, something (budget-friendly!) to complement her new healthy habit, but I feel a bit overwhelmed with where to start. Thanks to the Shopping Graph – Google’s ML-powered data set of the world’s shopping information, including brands, products and of course, price — I can search “shop Valentine’s Day deals” and select the spa category to find a great gift while also keeping in mind my budget. For Valentine’s Day, shoppers will also find a deals destination, featuring thousands of Valentine’s gift ideas from brands across the web, all on sale. This experience is available to U.S. users on mobile, desktop and the Google app (Android and iOS).3. Search (and shop) what you see with Google LensGoogle Lens is the ultimate companion tool when gift inspiration strikes. You might already know that Lens is a handy shopping feature that allows you to take a photo of something and find what it is and where to buy it or something similar. But there are a couple other ways it can work, too. For example, my mom loves getting flowers, so when I see some while out on a run I can quickly open the Google app (Android and iOS) and snap a pic with Lens to identify them. (Plus, using multisearch, I could even type in descriptive text to search for, say, similar flowers in a blue hue.) And since my husband and I like to go big on a fancy meal instead of exchanging gifts on Valentine’s Day, if I see a pic of a pasta dinner we really loved while vacationing in Italy in my photo gallery, I can ask Lens to tell me more about what it was and help me find a restaurant near me that serves it.4. Circle up with Circle to Search before you buyI get tons of gift ideas when I’m scrolling social media that make me think of my friends and family — so if I happen to come across an image that happens to have the perfect dog bed in the background, I can use Circle to Search to help me find out more about it without leaving whatever app I’m using. All I have to do is simply circle, highlight or scribble that specific part of an item and Circle to Search can help me discover more about the item and even shop for it or similar items from a range of retailers without switching apps. Circle to Search is available on Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 series.5. Try AI-enhanced photo giftsA picture is worth a thousand words — including, “Thank you so much, I love it!” While my first love language is sharing an elaborate meal, a close runner-up is photo gifts. I take a ton of photos with my Pixel 8 Pro, especially during special trips and important moments, and preserving those memories for my loved ones can make a thoughtful, affordable gift. Like the photo below that I took at Yosemite on a hiking trip with my husband, which I captured using the Tensor-powered Super Res Zoom feature. Or the one I took of the night sky with Night Sight (which also uses AI) during a yearly camping trip with my girlfriends. Whatever photos I end up using, I’ll also run them through AI editing features like Magic Eraser to get rid of unwanted objects or Photo Unblur to clean them up a bit before I print them.",
            "And if you plan on sharing or gifting a photo of you and your significant other, Best Take is your best friend: This tool uses AI to scan a handful of photos taken in quick succession and allows you to select the best image of each person in the picture.Once I’m ready to print, I use Google Photos to turn my shots into photos of various sizes or even canvas prints. If you, like me, have enough photos to fill a whole book — well, then, you can ask Google Photos to gather various images and create a photo book for you. Using AI, this feature selects the best photos for your book and makes sure to remove duplicates and low-quality images. Google Photos’ AI can even suggest themes for your photo book. For example, Google Photos’ AI suggested an entire Yosemite photo book for me and compiled it without any prompting. Which, in saving me so much time, is kind of like a gift from me to me."

            "Say you stumble on something interesting as you’re browsing a website, scrolling through social media or catching up on a group text. Maybe it’s an unfamiliar word, a city you’ve never visited or a new coffee shop your friend recommended. With Circle to Search, you can find more information about it right when it piques your curiosity.Starting today, Circle to Search is rolling out on Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 series. Now you can search anything with a simple gesture — like circling, highlighting, scribbling or tapping — without switching apps.To help you get started, here are five ways to use Circle to Search — from comparing restaurant recommendations in a group chat, to shopping for items that catch your eye in a video.1. Shop what you seeCircle to Search can help you discover more about items you see, and shop for them whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. So if you see someone wearing a unique, patterned top or spot a beautifully designed rotating cake stand online, long press the home button or navigation bar, and circle or scribble the items you’re interested in. From there, you can shop the same or similar options from retailers across the web.",
            "2. Look up a word or phraseWith Circle to Search, it’s easy to look up definitions of words or phrases. Say you’re watching a video featuring a drink with the word “prebiotic” on it, but you aren’t quite sure what that means — or how it’s different from “probiotic.” Usually, you would have to leave where you are and search for the word. Now, just long press the home button or navigation bar to activate Circle to Search and highlight “prebiotic” to learn more about it. When you’re done, just swipe away and resume the video.",
            "3. Get travel inspirationCircle to Search can even give you ideas for your next trip. Maybe you come across a video or social media post of someone exploring a city, and you spot a uniquely designed building. Previously, you might have taken a screenshot and switched apps to search it, typed out a description or scrolled through the comments to try and find out what it was. With Circle to Search, simply scribble over the building to quickly identify it (and maybe add it to your own travel itinerary).4. Compare optionsNow you can easily compare options without leaving your screen. Say you’re texting with friends to decide where to eat. They send you two different restaurant options, but you’re not familiar with either. Instead of switching between your text thread and an app to look them up, long press the home button or navigation bar and highlight one of the restaurant’s names. Without leaving your messaging app, you’ll see the restaurant's menu, photos of popular dishes, customer reviews and its location. Once you’ve looked at both options, just swipe away and let the group know which spot you’re craving.5. Ask more complex questionsCircle to Search not only gives you quick information, it can give you AI-powered overviews (available in select countries). Let’s say you’ve come across several social media posts with interesting-looking corn dogs, and you want to know why these delicious treats are trending. You can use Circle to Search to look them up and ask a more nuanced question, like “Why are these so popular?” You’ll quickly learn that these are Korean corn dogs and understand why they’re trending through helpful information that’s pulled together from across the web. Once you’re done, you can swipe away and get right back to scrolling.",

            "For more than two decades, we’ve continuously redefined what a search engine can do — always guided by our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. This has gone hand in hand with our ongoing advancements in AI, which help us better understand information in its many forms — whether it’s text, audio, images or videos.As part of this evolution, we’ve made it easier to express what you’re looking for in ways that are more natural and intuitive. For instance, you can search with your voice, or you can search with your camera using Lens. And recently, we’ve been testing how generative AI’s ability to understand natural language makes it possible to ask questions on Search in a more natural way.Ultimately, we envision a future where you can search any way, anywhere you want. Now, as we enter 2024, we’re introducing two major updates that bring this vision closer to reality: Circle to Search and an AI-powered multisearch experience. Let’s take a look at what’s ahead.Circle (or highlight or scribble) to SearchToday we unveiled Circle to Search, a new way to search anything on your Android phone screen without switching apps. With a simple gesture, you can select images, text or videos in whatever way comes naturally to you — like circling, highlighting, scribbling or tapping — and find the information you need right where you are.",
            "When something grabs your interest (like these adorable dog goggles), it can be disruptive to stop what you’re doing and use another app or browser to start searching for information. But now, whether you’re texting friends, browsing social media or watching a video, you can search what’s on your screen right when your curiosity strikes. And as we’ve shared, Search and Shopping ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the results page.Circle to Search is launching globally on select premium Android smartphones on January 31, starting with the Pixel 8, the Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 series.Point your camera, ask a question, get help from AIIn 2022, we pioneered multisearch in Lens as a new way to search multimodally, with both images and text. Since it launched, multisearch has been best for refining visual queries — like searching for a photo of red sneakers with Lens and adding the word “blue” to find them in your preferred color. But now, thanks to our recent breakthroughs in generative AI, multisearch makes exploring the world easier than ever before.Starting today, when you point your camera (or upload a photo or screenshot) and ask a question using the Google app, the new multisearch experience will show results with AI-powered insights that go beyond just visual matches. This gives you the ability to ask more complex or nuanced questions about what you see, and quickly find and understand key information.For example, imagine you’re at a yard sale and you come across an unfamiliar board game. There’s no box or instructions, so immediately some questions spring to mind: What is this game and how is it played? This is where the new multisearch experience can help.Just take a picture of the game, add your question (“How do you play this?”), and you’ll get an AI-powered overview that brings together the most relevant information from across the web. This way, you can quickly find out what the game is called and how to win. And with the AI-powered overview, it’s easy to dig deeper with supporting links and get all the details.",
            "AI-powered overviews on multisearch results are launching this week in English in the U.S. for everyone — no enrollment in Search Labs required. To get started, just look for the Lens camera icon in the Google app for Android or iOS. If you’re outside the U.S. and opted into Search Generative Experience (SGE), you can preview this new experience in the Google app. You’ll also be able to access AI-powered overviews on multisearch results within Circle to Search.Continuing to boldly experiment with generative AI in SearchThis week’s launch of AI-powered insights for multisearch is the result of testing we began last year to see how gen AI can make Search radically more helpful, with SGE in Search Labs. We’ve gotten lots of useful feedback from people who’ve chosen to join this experiment, and we’ll continue to offer SGE in Labs as a testbed for bold new ideas.But our goal is to make AI helpful for everyone, not just early adopters. So moving forward, as we continue to experiment and uncover which applications of gen AI are most helpful, we’ll introduce them into Search more broadly, like we’re doing now with multisearch results.Today’s updates will make Search even more natural and intuitive, but we've only just scratched the surface of what's possible. To try out the latest capabilities we’re testing, enroll in Search Labs (where available) and opt into the SGE experiment. We hope you’ll join Labs as we continue reimagining the future of Search."

And through our investments in AI, we’ve developed completely new ways to express what you’re looking for, in the way that’s most natural to you.Beyond text, we’ve already made it possible to ask a question aloud with your voice, find the name of a song just by humming it or search what you see using Lens. With every technological breakthrough, we’ve gotten closer to helping you search any way, anywhere.

            "For example, maybe you need help identifying a few items a creator wore in their “Outfit of the Day” video, but they didn’t tag the brands. Just long press the home button or navigation bar on your Android phone to activate Circle to Search. From there, you can select any item that you see with your preferred gesture — like circling their sunglasses — to quickly find similar, shoppable options from retailers across the web. You could scribble the bag and tap on the boots to look those up, too — all without leaving where you are. When you’re done, simply swipe away and you’re right back where you started.Other times, you might want to ask more complex questions about what you see. Let’s say you're browsing social media and come across an image of a delicious corn dog with some unique toppings.

Simply circle the corn dog and ask a question, like \"Why are these so popular?\" You’ll quickly learn that these sweet and savory treats are Korean corn dogs. And they’re trending because of their unique combination of flavors and textures — including meat or gooey melted cheese surrounded by a crunchy exterior — and the growing popularity of Korean cuisine. Just like that, your curiosity is satisfied (although the photos might leave you with an appetite).",
            "Or perhaps you’re on YouTube Shorts and you notice a video covering an unfamiliar topic: thrift flipping. With Circle to Search, you can quickly scribble over the text “thrift flip” to learn that it’s the process of purchasing items from a thrift store, fixing them up and then reselling them for a profit. Now that you know, you can easily close out and resume watching the video.",

            "1. Get more sustainable choices when you travelYou can now find relevant train routes when you search for flights in Google Search making it easier to consider options like high-speed rail when you travel. When you choose to fly, you can also find a carbon emissions estimate for nearly every flight in Google Flights results — right next to the price and duration of the trip. This means that when you’re choosing among flights of similar cost or timing, you can also factor carbon emissions into your decision.",
            "2. Take a more fuel-efficient routePeople are looking for information about how to reduce their environmental footprint when in transit. That’s why we continue expanding fuel-efficient routes to new countries, like India and Indonesia. You can find these routes by looking for the little green leaf in Google Maps – it indicates the most fuel efficient route if it isn’t already the fastest",
            "3. Understand your car-buying choicesFor people shopping for an electric vehicle, it’s now even easier to understand the costs associated with buying a new vehicle. In the U.S., when people search for terms like “best electric cars,” they can quickly compare prices, battery range, charging times, and power output of individual models. They can also find federal government incentives for qualifying vehicles in the U.S and parts of Europe.",
            "4. Use our Fuel Cost Calculator to find the most affordable optionsIf you’re considering buying an EV or if you’ve had an EV for a while, it’s helpful to understand the cost of charging. That’s why we’re adding an updated Fuel Cost Calculator to electric and fuel-based car results to help drivers see the cost of charging compared with filling up at the pump. This is available now in 21 countries around the world.",
            "5. Mitigate EV range anxiety with Battery Range ExplorerWhen you search for an EV, you’ll get a visualization of how far you can go on a single charge—specific to that model. You can enter your own destination and we’ll show how much battery you’d have upon arrival. And, for really long trips, we’ll show you how many charges are needed along the way. This prediction takes into account factors like elevation change and speed limits.",
            "6. Find more detailed charging informationFinding EV charging stations has never been easier. If you search ‘EV charging’ in Google Maps, you’ll see nearby stations and information about when a charger was last used so you can get a sense of how reliable it is.",
            "7. Locate speedy charging optionsEV drivers on Android and iOS can also see even more helpful charging station information. Update your plug types in your electric vehicle settings in Maps to see whether a charger is compatible with your vehicle, real-time charging availability, and if the available chargers are fast, medium or slow.",
            "8. Compare home heating and cooling systemsWe’re making it easier for people looking to replace their home heating or cooling system. When you search for queries like “boilers” or “air conditioning” in Google Search, you’ll see information about potential options, including their capabilities, energy efficiency, and financial incentives, all in one place.",
            "9. Find nearby recycling pointsWe provide a group of recycling attributes for Google Business Profiles on Search and Maps, allowing local storefronts and shops to show the recycling services they offer and helping people share this information with others in their community. Now you can search for nearby recycling drop-off locations — through searches like \"plastic bottle recycling near me\" — all over the world.",
            "10. Buy used clothes and productsWhen you search for products on Google, like a winter coat, you’ll see a grid in the organic results with photos and listings from retailers across the web. If any of those products are pre-owned, you’ll see a “Pre-owned” label under that listing. There’s also a similar label for “Refurbished” electronics."

            "1. Organize your Chrome tabs into groups. If your browser tabs have been multiplying faster than emails you’ve been meaning to respond to, Chrome’s tab groups can help you solve at least one of those problems. It’s simple: Right-click on a tab, click “add tab to group” and assign it a name and color. Now you’ll find the tab nested within a handy group that you can easily expand or collapse.2. Check off your to-do list from your Android home screen. People who swear by lists to stay organized will be big fans of Google Keep’s new single note widget. Available on Android, the handy home screen add-on lets you put your to-dos front and center, displaying reminders, background colors and images added from the Keep app. It’ll also sync with Wear OS on your Pixel Watch, so you won’t miss any reminders when you’re on the go.3. Build a better habit tracker with Smart Chips in Sheets. A habit tracker is a great way to hold yourself accountable for New Years’ resolutions. One Googler documented how she used Smart Chips on her tracker to add interactive elements like dates and events (“@date”), embed files, create dropdown menus, and emoji-react to her progress. Bonus: Duet AI’s “help me organize” feature can build the sheet for you in a flash with just a few basic details.",
            "4. Declutter your Google Photos library. Nearly a third of most people’s photo galleries are made up of similar images — all the leftovers from taking multiple snapshots to get the perfect take. To help you tidy things up, Google Photos can identify these near-duplicates using AI and group them into photo stacks — complete with the photo that best seems to capture the moment. Photos can also categorize your files into helpful albums grouped by types such as “places,” “documents” and more to help you find what you need faster. 5. Write more advanced routines on Google Home. A new script editor in Google Home for web makes it possible to write even more sophisticated automations. (Example: “If my outdoor camera sees someone after dark, turn on the porch light and make an announcement.”) You don’t necessarily need any coding experience, either — thanks to generative AI, Google Home’s experimental “help me script” feature may be able to handle most of the heavy lifting. 6. Use Gmail to make your day go more smoothly. Gmail has several AI-powered features that can help you stay on track and flag urgent messages. There is also a new scheduling feature that can help you instantly find time to catch up with friends and colleagues. Priority Inbox segments your mail into sections like Important and Unread, Starred and Everything Else. You can also use the Multiple Inboxes feature — a favorite of Google productivity advisor Laura Mae Martin — to filter messages according to various themes and work projects.",

            "7. Quickly find what you’re looking for in faster, easier ways with our Search Generative Experience (SGE). Maybe you’re in the market for a new bike that’s good for a 5 mile commute with hills or maybe you need to know how to get a stubborn stain out of your favorite shirt. With generative AI capabilities in Search, we’re now taking more of the work out of searching, so you’ll be able to understand a topic faster, uncover new viewpoints and insights and get things done more easily. When you search, you’ll see an AI-powered overview of key information to consider, with links to dig deeper.",
            "8. Learn how to code with help from Bard. Whether you’re untangling a problem in C++ or simply trying to write a formula for Google Sheets, Bard has your back. Our generative AI collaborator can now help explain code snippets in more than 20 programming languages, debug code and even export Python code directly to Google Colab. 9. Add in-demand skills to your resume with Google Career Certificates. Google Career Certificates can help you take a first step toward working in growing fields like cybersecurity and data analytics IT support and project management. We spoke with three recent Career Certificate graduates who shared their best advice to maintain momentum in the program — starting with being your biggest advocate and learning how to shake off self-doubt.10. Use Chrome extensions to study more effectively. Students will find tons of options on the Chrome Web Store. Among our top picks: ComposeAI, which can help you edit research papers and cut down writing time by more than 40%; ToDoist, which tracks your assignments; and SwiftRead, which condenses web pages into more easily digestible snippets.11. Help your kids become sharper readers with Android and Google Classroom. Android phones and tablets can assist little ones with building new skills, too. If your kids could use a hand strengthening their vocabulary and comprehension skills, just look for the “Practice” badge while searching for children’s titles on Google Play Books. That means the ebook is equipped with special interactive features to help sound out words, practice pronunciation and more. And with Google Classroom's integration with the Read Along app, teachers can track students' reading progress and easily assign reading practice based on differentiated learning styles.12. Get help with math on Search. If your math skills are a little rusty, Search can help give you a refresher right in your browser window. Simply type “math solver” to pull up a special calculator to help you walk through linear equations, polynomials and more. Alternatively, you can just type the equation or integral directly into the search bar or take a picture with Lens to see a step-by-step explanation and solution.",

            "13. Generate a vacation itinerary instantly with Bard. The next time you’re visiting somewhere new and don’t know where to start, try asking Bard to point you in the right direction. With a few basic details — like the length of your trip, activities you’d like to prioritize and where you’re staying — it’ll generate a full itinerary complete with photos in a matter of seconds. If the result isn’t your speed, you can refine it further by adding more details — for instance, only attractions within walking distance of your hotel.14. Use Immersive View in Google Maps to navigate more confidently. Immersive View in Google Maps is perfect for travelers who like to know exactly what to expect at their destination, with its photorealistic view of an area. Immersive view for routes also recently debuted, making it easier than ever to preview your entire journey from point A to B to give you a sense of what the trip is really like, with helpful information like traffic and weather layered on top.",
            "15. Compare hotels on Search to find the right fit. The next time you’re looking for a hotel on Search, you’ll find a much easier way to compare your options. The new swipeable story format on mobile makes it as simple as tapping through a series of photos to get an idea of what to expect. See something you like? You can save the hotel, view a summary of reviews or pull up more details like the price and exact location instantly.16. Plan events more easily with Workspace. One Googler shared how Sheets helped her deal with the seemingly infinite logistics of planning a wedding. Her life hacks included using functions to track budgets, smart chips for tagging people, and drop down chips for providing quick status updates. Another Googler shared how she used multiple Workspace tools to plan a Halloween party, including Gmail, Forms, Docs and Sheets. Use these tips as a blueprint the next time you’re tasked with organizing a big gathering.17. Sign in to your Google Account without a password using Passkeys. Using a fingerprint, face scan or pin to sign in to your accounts isn’t just easier than remembering a convoluted password — it’s also more secure. That’s why Google began to offer passkeys by default earlier this year as part of our goal to make passwords obsolete. You can get started here by clicking “get passkeys.” While you get more familiar with passkeys, you can instantly add an extra layer of security to your account by enrolling in 2-Step Verification (2SV) — instructions below.",
            "18. Use Google Play Books to score deals on your most-wanted reads. The “recent price drops” collection under Google Play’s books tab (or the Play Books Android app) is a great place to go bargain-hunting for your next page-turner. If you’re a fan of a particular series, you can also often receive discounts for bundling books together or get notifications when new offers become available by adding books to your wishlist.19. Book an affordable getaway with Google Flights. What’re the odds that the flight you want to book will be cheaper if you wait a week? Upgraded insights from Google Flights can help you decide. The new details include trend data to see when prices are typically lowest — for instance, two months before takeoff — to help you find the sweet spot for your chosen dates and destination.",
            "CreateDealing with first-draft jitters? Tired of waiting for the muse? Just need to knock out a quick email? We’ve got plenty of new ways to help you find a spark when you need it most and get things moving again.",
            "20. Make a custom AI wallpaper on Android. Take your favorite background photo to the next level using Android’s Cinematic wallpaper feature. The feature uses machine learning to generate a more dynamic 3D version of the photo that moves as you unlock and tilt your phone. You can also create custom wallpapers with your favorite emojis in fun combinations of patterns and colors, or use the Generative AI feature to create your own unique wallpaper. These features are available first on compatible Pixel devices.",
            "21. Generate templates using smart chips and building blocks. Need a quick outline for taking meeting notes? Just type “@meeting notes” in Docs, pick the meeting from the menu, and it’ll automatically generate a template with the attendees, action items and more. That’s just one of the ways one Googler shared how she uses Docs features to stay organized and save precious minutes during her workday. 22. Snap a group photo that will make everyone smile with your Pixel phone. All it takes is a squirm or sideways glance to throw off a perfectly good group photo. Thankfully, you no longer need to settle for a happy medium when sifting through your options. Best Take on Pixel uses AI to select everyone’s best expressions from photos taken in a session into a single frame to help you get the best group photo, and Magic Eraser can eliminate distractions with just a few taps. To start using them, open Google Photos, tap “edit,” then “tools.” Select “Best Take” or “Magic Eraser” and assess your options.23. Use AI to draft the email replies you’ve been putting off. “Help me write” in Gmail is a game-changer for those moments when you just can’t find the words. Once you gain access to Duet AI through your employer or Workspace Labs, look for the star with a pencil and add a prompt explaining what you’re trying to write. Hit create, and it’ll generate a full first draft based on your prompt. From there, it’s easy to refine the copy by tweaking the length, tone, and more. Another option? Try asking Bard to write your first draft. From there, you can also use Smart Compose — now available across Chat, Gmail and Docs — to cut down on typos, fix grammatical errors and more."

            "The year is just about wrapped, and we’re all ready to say goodbye to 2023 and hello to 2024. But before we get excited about what the new year will bring, let’s take a look back at 23 of our biggest product moments from 2023!1. We welcomed the Gemini eraGemini is our largest and most capable AI model yet and the next step toward making AI more helpful for everyone. It’s built to be multimodal, meaning it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different kinds of information, including text, audio, video and code. Gemini is also our most flexible model yet, efficiently built to run on everything from mobile phones to data centers with three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. You can already use Gemini Pro in Bard and Gemini Nano in Pixel 8 Pro, and we just released the Gemini API for developers and Google Cloud customers last week.2. Bard entered the chatWe debuted Bard, an interactive experiment that lets you collaborate with generative AI. Bard has expanded considerably since its launch: Bard learned how to code, added visual capabilities and expanded globally and connected to more Google apps and services. Oh, and soon Bard and Assistant will start working together!3. We experimented with generative AI in SearchSearch Generative Experience (SGE) is a Search Labs experiment that uses generative AI to help you understand topics in faster, easier ways and uncover new insights. You can get AI-powered overviews that bring together the most helpful and relevant information available for your search, with links to learn more. This year, we also added the ability to create images with generative AI.4. Android kept the updates comingAndroid 14 dropped, and with it came tons of customization updates, like new options and styles for shortcuts, generative AI wallpapers, color palettes, fonts, widgets and more. Android 14 also includes new health, security and data upgrades and expanded features for low-vision and hard-of-hearing users. And we launched Magic Compose in beta, a Google Messages generative AI tool that helps you find exactly the right words.5. We introduced powerful new Pixel phonesThe Pixel Fold, our first foldable phone, made its big debut in 2023. Meanwhile, we continued our A-series with Pixel 7a, and we launched Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. Our latest Pixel series is powered by Google Tensor G3 and sports a new batch of pro-level camera features. The Pixel 8 Pro is also the first smartphone with AI built in, now running Gemini Nano to power new features such as Summarize in the Recorder app.",
            "6. The Pixel family grewThere’s more to the Pixel family than phones: This year also marked the debut of the brand new Pixel Tablet and its slick docking station. And Pixel Buds Pro got an upgrade with clearer voice calling, suggestions for hearing wellness and more.7. Plus, there was Chromebook PlusWe also launched Chromebook Plus, a powerful, AI-driven device with features and tools specifically designed for any consumer looking to step up their laptop game. Chromebook Plus comes with the best-in-class security and access to all the apps users know and love, and twice the power, speed, memory and storage as standard Chromebooks.8. We welcomed wearable updatesWe introduced the Google Pixel Watch 2, a more powerful smartwatch with improved health insights and new safety features for peace of mind, and the Fitbit Charge 6, which comes with real-time heart rate tracking that connects to compatible exercise equipment plus seven days of battery life. And there were two major software upgrades for wearables: The new Fitbit app made its way to the Google Pixel Watch and Fitbit devices, and a new version of Wear OS brought new productivity and entertainment features to Google Pixel Watch and other Wear OS-enabled devices.9. We launched new ways to track your healthThese new products came with new ways to monitor your wellness. In addition to our most accurate heart-rate tracking system for Google Pixel Watch as well as for Fitbit Charge 6, we also built new tools like fall detection and oxygen saturation (SpO2) tracking for the Google Pixel Watch.10. We helped you be preparedWe launched extreme heat alerts to help people find information about heat waves and expanded flood forecasting to more regions. And the new Pollen API gave developers using Google Maps Platform the ability to add information on changing allergens in a given area.11. Google Maps got even more immersiveThis year saw plenty of big updates for Google Maps, like the start of the Immersive View for routes rollout, which enables you to visually preview an entire trip — bike lanes, intersections, where to park and more — before you even step out the door. Maps also helped navigate the great outdoors with new features for exploring national parks. Plus we expanded fuel-efficient routing to more places to help combat CO2 emissions.12. We focused on photo featuresWe launched some AI editing tools this year: Magic Editor, which helps you easily make complex edits like repositioning the subject of your photo, and Best Take for Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, which uses a series of similar photos taken close together to help you automatically create a blended image with everyone’s best expression. To make taking those group photos even easier, we announced palm gesture selfies — a feature that enables you to trigger the shutter with a wave of the hand. And to help you better enjoy and surface your photos after the fact, we also launched a new Memories view for Google Photos.13. RCS got a little richerRich communication standard, or RCS, is the modern texting standard around the world. We’ve been working to help carriers and smartphone makers adopt this protocol, and it’s paying off: RCS hit 1 billion users in Google Messages this year! To celebrate, we launched tons of new features that support RCS and make Messages even better for Android users — for example, we added end-to-end encryption for group messages and Voice Moods (beta) to accompany your voice messages with fun visual effects..14. Workspace worked hardThis year was full of Google Workspace launches. To name just a few: We expanded the AI-powered Smart Compose feature to Google Chat, helping you quickly craft a response in Chat, offering contextually aware suggestions that help reduce spelling and grammar errors. New building blocks for Workspace made adding more info like additional files or Google Calendar entries just an @ away. And our new meeting scheduler in Gmail made it easier for you to find time to meet directly from your inbox.15. Duet AI for Google Workspace helped you workDuet AI in Google Workspace is an AI-powered collaborator that can act as a coach, thought partner, source of inspiration and productivity booster, that became generally available in August. Today, customers and trusted testers are using it across the Workspace tools they’ve known and loved for years. For example: Duet AI in Slides can help you easily generate images for your presentations with simple text-based prompts. Duet AI in Sheets can automatically create custom plans for tasks, projects or any activity that you want to track or manage. Duet AI in Gmail can help you write or refine emails. Duet AI in Meet helps you generate unique backgrounds for your video calls, and Duet AI in Docs can help you write and refine whatever it is you’re drafting.16. And we expanded Duet AI in Google CloudDuet AI isn’t just for Workspace — we also expanded our AI-powered collaborator across Google Cloud, providing AI assistance across a wide range of Google Cloud products and services to serve more cloud users, including developers, operators, data practitioners, and cybersecurity professionals. For example: Duet AI for Developers, now generally available, helps users increase software development and delivery velocity with a range of helpful features, including AI code assistance, natural language chat, AI-assisted troubleshooting, AI-powered smart actions and reduced context-switching and expedited learning.17. Passkeys boosted securityWe stepped up security with passkeys, a simpler and more secure way to sign into your accounts online. With passkeys, you use a fingerprint, face scan or pin to unlock your device and sign into your accounts — without the need for a password. Passkeys rely on a type of technology called public key cryptography that makes them more secure than passwords — which is why we made them even more accessible by offering them by default across personal Google Accounts.18. We gave virtual try-ons a tryGoogle introduced a new AI-powered tool that lets you virtually try on clothing using a diverse set of 80 real models in a range of sizes — from XXS to 4XL — as well as with different skin tones, body shapes, ethnicities and hair types.19. YouTube added new AI tools for creators and artistsAt Made on YouTube 2023, we announced AI features that will enable people to push the bounds of creative expression including AI-generated backgrounds for Shorts with Dream Screen and a new mobile video production app called YouTube Create. And we launched experimental music AI tools, like Dream Track for Shorts, which allows a small cohort of creators the opportunity to create up to 30 second unique Shorts soundtracks featuring the AI-generated voice of the participating artists of their choice with just a simple prompt!20. We spent time in the labEarlier this year we launched Labs, a home for Google’s experimental AI tools and technologies. When you sign up for Labs, you can test out projects across Search, Workspace and more, and give feedback directly to the teams who built them. One of our Labs offerings is NotebookLM, our endeavor to reimagine what note-taking software might look like if you designed it from scratch knowing that you would have a powerful AI model at its core.21. Chrome got a little shinierWe released a whole new look for the Chrome Web Store as well as a handful of address bar updates. And when our favorite browser turned 15 this year, we announced new features — like refreshed icons, new color palettes and AI-powered extensions — to celebrate.22. We helped you source your factsWe launched new and updated current tools to help you fact check information you see online. Fact Check Explorer, which is used by fact checkers and journalists around the world, added an image-checking feature so now you can see if other fact checkers have verified it. And Search introduced About this image, which brings you information about an image’s web history, details on how websites use it as well as its metadata.23. And the Search continued2023 marked 25 years of Google Search! And we’re definitely not slowing down: Along with expanding Multisearch and introducing SGE, we added 33 new languages to Google Translate and more help with science and math. We also added upgraded insights on Google Flights to help you find the best price. Plus, Google Trends got a makeover."

            "We’re continuing to work towards making AI useful for everyone, including by collaborating with others— and approaching it in a bold and responsible way.A great example of this is Lengua Española e Inteligencia Artificial — Spanish Language and Artificial Intelligence (LEIA), a project the Real Academia Española (RAE) set up four years ago to improve the use of the Spanish language in technological environments. The Academia invited tech companies to join, committing to improving the use of the Spanish language in technological environments, helping the 590 million Spanish speakers worldwide and increasing the presence of the Spanish language.Today, we’re announcing two major advances we’ve made as part of this project: First off, we’ve incorporated the lexical repertoire of the RAE’s Dictionary of the Spanish Language into Gboard, the keyboard app from Google. Second, we’ve integrated the Spanish Language Dictionary of the Royal Academy into Search.Improved Spanish in GboardThanks to the integration of the RAE lexicon as a source for Gboard's AI language models, we’ve seen key improvements in Gboard, such as faster autocorrections, in words such as García, Rodríguez, Coruña, Nicaragua or Jaén, and those with an accent — like música, río, frío o vehículo. It has also allowed for better word recommendations, smoother changes between English and Spanish when typing, and reduced biases.Moreover, hundreds of thousands of new words (\"ibuprofeno\", \"criptomonedas\", \"SMS\", \"tempura\") have been integrated into the Gboard dictionary for Android.",
            "Integration of RAE’s Diccionario de la Lengua Española into SearchAs of this week, we’re also integrating the Spanish Language Dictionary of the Royal Academy into Search. This means when Google Search users from all over the world search for meanings of Spanish words, synonyms or examples of how to use Spanish words in sentences, the “Diccionario de la Lengua Española” will be the source powering such queries. The 23 Spanish language academies around the world participate in the Dictionary,making sure it reaches every Spanish speaker, regardless of the dialect varieties.",
            "In addition to LEIA, in recent years we’ve made other advances to improve or increase the presence of the Spanish language in our tools. That includes incorporating Spanish grammar suggestions into Smart Compose and Google Docs, where punctuation marks have been added to the autocorrect, and corrections are suggested for sentences with grammatically incorrect pronouns. Machine learning has also enabled us to implement improvements in the automatic translation provided by Translate, generating improvements in Spanish, among other languages.Our commitment to help increase the usage of the Spanish language in the world and a better use of the Spanish language in technological environments is the driving force behind our participation in LEIA. It’s our hope that AI will continue to benefit all Spanish speakers worldwide."

Today, we're kicking off our 25 Years in Search celebration by highlighting the most searched people, places and things of all time.25 years of Search has given us a lot to look back on, including nearly two decades of Trends data. And as we discovered, our searches revealed a shared curiosity — around the world, we're often inspired by the same moments and seek the same answers.Soccer, the world's most-searched sport, and Cristiano Ronaldo, its most-searched athlete, demonstrate a love for the game that transcends borders. Taylor Swift's status as the most-searched songwriter highlights the profound connection people feel with her music, and by extension, with each other. We also see shared humanity in the most-searched \"how to help\" query: how to help people. And the heart emoji, the most-searched emoji, reveals yet another universal theme: our shared need for love and understanding.In addition to a Year in Search film unlike ever before, we're launching even more ways for the world to experience and explore insights from the last 25 years. We’re releasing our annual 2023 Trends Global and Local Lists featuring top trending searches across 210 U.S. regions, a Most Searched Time Capsule highlighting most searched things from each year, and the Most Searched Playground, an interactive game and Doodle launching tomorrow that features 25 of the most-searched trends, from everyday to iconic.Over the years, Google Trends have made us laugh, inspired us to dream, and challenged us to see the world differently. More importantly, however, they’ve reflected the magic of human curiosity, the power of information and have proven to us again and again that a search for answers is a promise of progress. If the last 25 years have taught us anything, it’s that the next 25 will change everything.To watch the film and see all the trends that defined the last 25 years and 2023, check out our Year in Search website."

They even inspired other top trends: Both “Barbie nails” and “Barbie outfits” were top trending searches in the U.S. in their categories. In fact, this year we were all here for the fashion trends — “it’s giving fashion” was the top trending “it’s giving.”We also continued to evolve the ways in which you can search, whether it's by taking a photo for Lens or humming a song into Search. The caterpillar crawled its way past the butterfly to become the top lensed insect this year and we all hummed Imagine Dragons’ “Bones” to the top of the charts as this year's top Hum to Search song. Our curiosity also extended to the outdoors: On Google Maps, Barcelona’s Park Güell and Paris’ Louvre Museum were the top searched park and museum globally.Curious to see what your local area is searching for? This year we are relaunching our local hub, which takes a look at the interesting trends that have emerged this year from around the U.S. Across the country we are taking a look at the top trending TV shows, concerts, sports matchups and “near me” searches from every metro area. The experience even gives you some fun facts: Did you know that Quincy, Illinois was the only place in the U.S. with “day trips near me” as a top trending “near me” search?With this year being Google's 25th birthday, we're expanding this annual tradition from a Year in Search to 25 Years in Search.

            "Technology has improved so many aspects of the way we shop, like how we research, find inspiration, try out products and look for deals. And now, as we approach the busiest shopping weeks of the year, technology — especially generative AI — is making it much easier to find gifts for others (and ourselves).Read on for more about our new shopping experiences and opt into Search Labs at goo.gle/sge-gifts.Get AI-generated gift ideasSearch Generative Experience (SGE), which brings generative AI capabilities into Search, is designed to help you understand topics in faster, easier ways and uncover new insights — which can be especially useful for gift-giving. And today we’re rolling out a new capability within SGE to help holiday shoppers more easily get inspired and find that perfect holiday gift.Let’s say you’re looking for a present for the budding chef in your life and don’t know where to start. Search “great gifts for home cooks\", and you’ll now see a wide variety of subcategories to explore — like specialty tools, artisanal ingredients, culinary subscriptions and even experiences like cooking classes — with options from brands large and small. Just tap into a category to browse shoppable gift options and select a product to buy.",
            "With generative AI, you can really home in on your gift recipient’s unique preferences. If you’re looking for “great gifts for home cooks who love pasta\", for instance, you can get more specific options that are sure to bring a smile to their face (and stomach). Or say your loved one has a more niche interest, like a 7 year old who wants to be an inventor. With this experience, you can get creative, specific, shoppable ideas — from chemistry sets to coding kits — and become a world-class gift-giver in no time.SGE is designed as a jumping-off point to explore the web. You’ll see links to helpful content from publishers front and center, so you can easily click through to a website to learn more about a product or gift category. In fact, with SGE we’re showing more links, and links to a wider range of sources, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. And as we’ve shared, Search and Shopping ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the page.If you're already opted into SGE in the U.S., you can start using this tool in the Google app (Android and iOS) and on Chrome desktop today. If not, you can opt in through Search Labs at goo.gle/sge-gifts.Shop what’s (literally) on your mind‘Tis the season for giving, but about half of people actually shop for themselves over the holidays.1 Shoppers, especially apparel shoppers, also often have a very specific vision in mind: In fact, 20% of apparel queries are five words or longer.2 So we’re introducing a new way to put the item that’s on your mind right into your shopping cart with AI-powered image generation for shopping.We’re connecting our image generation technology with more than 35 billion listings in our Shopping Graph to help you better visualize and find the style you’re looking for. Soon when you use SGE to look for apparel, you’ll have the option to generate photorealistic images inspired by the words you search — and shop products that match those images.Let’s say you want a new winter coat — a colorful, patterned puffer jacket — but you haven’t found quite what you’re looking for. With generative AI in Search, just look for that style and tap “Generate images” to see photorealistic images that match your vision. And if you want to make an adjustment, like if you’d prefer a colorful metallic jacket instead of a patterned one, just enter that refinement in the text box to see a new set of images. Once you’ve found one you like, scroll down to see similar shoppable products.",
            "We’re rolling out this new capability on mobile in the U.S. starting in December. At that time, anyone already opted into SGE can use this tool. If you’re not opted in, head to Search Labs in the Google app (Android and iOS).",
            "Virtually try on clothes, now including men’s topsGenerative AI can also help you get a better idea of what a piece of clothing will look like on you. Since launching our generative AI-powered virtual try-on tool for women’s tops, we’ve found that products with the option to virtually try on have received significantly higher-quality interactions from shoppers. That means shoppers are spending time using the feature and potentially taking action, like making a purchase. And today we’re expanding it to a new category: men’s tops.Now, when you search for “men’s tops” in the Google app or from any mobile browser (and soon, desktop) in the U.S., you’ll see results from hundreds of brands — like Abercrombie, Banana Republic, J.Crew and Under Armour — with a “try-on” icon. Just tap the result to see how that piece of clothing looks on a real model who resonates with you. You can select from 40 models ranging in skin tone, body shape, height and size so you can make a more confident decision.",
            "So if you’re looking for just the right thing for family, friends or yourself this holiday season, these new generative AI tools can help you shop smarter and more confidently than ever."

This new capability is rolling out on the Google app and Chrome and Safari on mobile in English in the U.S. over the coming weeks.",

For example, if you’ve searched for something a few times, like DIY instructions for a backyard project, and keep returning to the same web page, our systems will recognize that and bring the site to the top of the search results page. As always, you can see which results are personalized and easily access personal settings by clicking on the three dots next to any web link.Even more firsthand knowledge in SearchOne of the best ways to get information that works for your specific needs is to find someone with firsthand experience. We’re introducing a few updates to make it easier for people to find and share their insights with others on Search.This May, we added new ways to find and explore diverse perspectives on Search in the Google app and mobile web. In the coming weeks, we’ll bring the perspectives filter to desktop Search, so you can choose to exclusively see content from people on social media platforms, forums and other communities. And starting today, we’ll show new information on search results that highlights information about the individual creator — like their social handle, follower count or the popularity of their content — so it’s easier to find content from creators you care about.As part of this work, we’ve also rolled out a series of ranking improvements to show more first-person perspectives in results, so it’s easier to find this content across Search.Notes: A new experiment in Search LabsWith the sea of information on the web, it isn’t always easy to know what content is going to be most helpful for you. So we’re introducing a new experiment in Search Labs to help people learn from the experiences of others on the web. With Notes, we're exploring a new way to share tips and advice about web content, right on Search. We’ve seen in our research that people want peer validation and like to see what others are saying about a given web page. Notes gives people a helpful layer of human insights on each Search result, working hand in hand with existing content on the web and making it more useful.Whether you’re an artist in North Dakota or a teacher in Mumbai, we want to help you find exactly what you’re looking for — and to share your knowledge with the world. We hope these updates make staying on top of your interests, learning new skills, and sharing with others just a little bit easier."

            "Often, the best place to find answers to your most specific questions is with someone who’s been in your shoes before. Today, we’re building on our existing work to help people find a wide range of perspectives on Search with a new opt-in experiment in Search Labs called Notes. Notes will let people share their knowledge right on Search, helping others find the best answers for their weirdest or most wonderfully unique questions, and discover what’s most useful for them on the web.We’ve seen in our research that people are interested in what people like them are saying about a given web page. Notes are designed to work hand-in-hand with existing content on the web, adding a new layer of human insights to your search results. In this new experiment, you can get helpful context about a web page so you can better identify information that might be most useful for you — or you can share your expertise with the world. Notes might help you uncover tips about which neighborhoods might be best for you in an article about a new city, or how to tone down the spice level on a recipe. Or maybe a baking guide helped you create the perfect color frosting — you can leave a note to help other people avoid first-timer mistakes.",
            "Our goal with this new Labs experiment is to provide access to helpful tips about an article or topic from both experts and everyday people. This not only helps you narrow in on the most relevant information, but also may help you see what worked for others who have been there before.Once you’ve opted in to Notes in Search Labs, you’ll see a “Notes” button appear below search results in the Google app, and on articles on Discover. Tap this button, and you can see what others have said about the web page. When you visit a page you think is helpful, you can easily create a note to share your experience with the topic or article. You can customize your note with elements like text, stickers and photos, and you can pick from different visual styles to make it feel like your own. In the U.S., we’ll soon launch the ability to add an AI-generated image to your note as well.",

Notes relies heavily on the protections developed over decades of bringing you reliable, helpful information on Search. We’re using a combination of algorithmic protections and human moderation to make sure notes are as safe, helpful and relevant as possible, and to protect against harmful or abusive content. As with all Labs experiments, we’ll use this time to test and learn what works best for users before bringing these capabilities to a broader audience on Search. Read more about our content safety approach on our Notes policy page.In the months ahead, we’ll actively explore ways to provide site owners insights into notes on their content. We understand this is an important need for websites, and we’re committed to working with them to determine what tools and insights will be most beneficial.Help other people by sharing your expertise in a note! Notes will be available in Search Labs in the Google app (Android and iOS) starting today in English in the U.S. and Hindi and English in India."

            "This year, we’ve been testing how generative AI in Search can help people find what they’re looking for in new, faster ways. With Search Generative Experience (SGE), you can get AI-powered overviews that bring together the most helpful and relevant information available for your search.Already, generative AI in Search is allowing us to serve a wider range of information needs, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. With SGE, we’re showing more links, and links to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered.As we’ve continually improved the experience, we’ve also expanded internationally beyond the United States with recent launches in India and Japan. So far, the vast majority of feedback in all three countries has been positive, and people are finding generative AI particularly useful for complex questions they wouldn’t typically think to search.Now, in our largest global expansion yet, we’re bringing generative AI in Search to more than 120 new countries and territories, along with support for four new languages. And we’re introducing a few upgrades, launching first in the U.S., that will make SGE more interactive as you search – including easier follow-ups, AI-powered translation help, and more definitions for topics like coding.Launching in more than 120 new countries and territories, plus four new languagesStarting today, we’re bringing Search Labs and SGE in English to more than 120 new countries and territories around the world, including Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.As part of this expansion, we’re also enabling four new languages for everyone using SGE: Spanish, Portuguese, Korean and Indonesian. So if, for example, you’re a Spanish speaker in the U.S., you can now use generative AI in Search with your preferred language.",
            "Search Labs is a new way for you to test early-stage experiments on Search, available on the Google app (Android and iOS) and on Chrome desktop. Once you’re enrolled in Search Labs, just enable the SGE experiment to get started. In new countries, access via Chrome desktop is available today, and access through the Google app will be enabled over the coming week.Testing an easier way to ask follow-up questionsWe’ve learned from testing generative AI in Search that people appreciate the ability to ask follow-up questions, because it’s a more natural way to seek information or dig deeper on a topic. Now, we’re experimenting with a new way for you to ask follow-up questions directly from the search results page. As you continue to explore a topic, you can easily see your prior questions and search results, including Search ads in dedicated ad slots throughout the page.",
            "Maybe you searched for “how to run with my beagle” and now you want to ask “how about hiking.” Just tap to enter your question and let your curiosity lead the way. This update will start to roll out over the coming weeks, starting first in English in the United States, and we will continue to iterate on this experience.Adding more context to your translationsSometimes, translating from one language to another involves a bit of guesswork. For instance, in many languages, a single word can have multiple meanings that standard translation tools won’t necessarily detect. Let’s say you want to translate “is there a tie?” from English to Spanish. It seems straightforward, but it’s possible that the word tie could refer to either a piece of clothing or a contest with no winner.Fortunately, generative AI in Search can help you avoid that kind of ambiguity. Soon, if you ask Search to translate a phrase where certain words could have more than one possible meaning, you’ll see those terms underlined. Tap any of those words and you can indicate the specific meaning that reflects what you want to say. This option may also appear when you need to specify the gender for a particular word.",
            "This AI-powered translation capability is coming soon to the United States for English-to-Spanish translations, and we plan to cover more countries and languages in the near future.Showing definitions for coding and health informationIn August, we added a new, interactive way to see definitions for educational topics — like science, economics, or history — on AI-powered overviews. Now, we’re extending this functionality to more areas, including coding and health information. On relevant searches, you’ll see certain words highlighted, so you can hover over them to preview their definition or view related images. This update is rolling out over the next month, in English in the United States, with more countries and languages expected to follow soon."

During his time as Chief, he championed our tribe by speaking to governmental bodies like the United States Congress and what is now known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs to secure healthcare, housing and education for his people. He focused on the most fundamental and pressing issues of his time, using the tools he had, knowing that improvement on those fronts would benefit future generations.Through my work at Google and as one of the global leads of the Google Aboriginal and Indigenous Network (GAIN) employee resource group, I’m also in a position to help my community, using Google’s technology to bring their businesses online, connect them with resources to build digital skills and more.As November unfolds, we embark on a month-long celebration of Native American heritage, and Google is honoring Indigenous cultures through our products and services. Here’s how we’re honoring and amplifying Indigenous voices throughout the month.",
            "1. Highlighting Indigenous businessesStarting today, it will now be easier to find Indigenous-owned businesses in your community. Merchants in the U.S. with a verified Business Profile can add an Indigenous-owned attribute to their profile, making it easier for customers to find and support them through Search and Maps. Throughout the process of creating this attribute, we worked in partnership with the National Congress of American Indians and members of GAIN. This new offering joins the available Asian-owned, Black-owned, disabled-owned, Latino-owned, LGBTQ+ owned, veteran-owned and women-owned business attributes.",

Today, Eighth Generation is owned by the Snoqualmie Tribe and partners with community-based Indigenous artists around the country to design, manufacture and market wool blankets and gifts intended for everyone around the world. During our filming, I was struck by what Louie shared about the importance of supporting Indigenous-owned businesses: \"The more true we can be about our identity, the more consumers can make values based decisions to support Native-owned businesses, and thereby strengthen the actual stewards of the cultural art, and the cultural stories that they want to align with.\"Our hope is that this attribute will help enable support for Indigenous-owned businesses like Eighth Generation by providing another way for consumers to support a diversity of businesses across Google’s products and platforms.2.

            "Halloween books for kids“The Science of Monsters,” by Timothy J. Bradley: Have you ever wondered if a mummy could really come back to life? Or if a creature like Godzilla could actually exist? We all know that monsters are make-believe – this book helps to explain the stories behind their origins and the science that makes their existence so unlikely.“Halloween,” by James Lantos: “Merry Halloween!” Kind of a strange way to celebrate the spooky holiday, if you ask me. This book of Halloween postcards and posters shows how they did it in the olden days.“Jack O’lantern and other rhymes,” by Eleanor W. Talbot: Another callback to a bygone era, this volume of poetry for kids has some fun old-timey references. (What exactly is a “velocipede,” anyway?) The rhymes and illustrations give an impression of what it might have been like to be a child in the late 19th century.“The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” by Washington Irving: The moody atmosphere of this short story has enthralled readers for over 200 years. Author Irving Washington took inspiration from the stories of old Europe to create one of the first American ghost stories, and a remarkably sketched antihero in the main character of Ichabod Crane.",
            "Scarier stories for grown-ups (or bigger kids)“Frankenstein,” by Mary Shelley: More than just a monster creation story, Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” has implications for the modern era as it discusses the challenges of ethics in relation to scientific discovery. Frankenstein’s monster was no true villain; instead, his creator Victor Frankenstein is a tragic hero, destined to fail for attempting to thwart the laws of nature.“Dracula,” by Bram Stoker: This Gothic horror story brought the vampire legend into popular culture, spawning an endless number of iterations of the blood-sucking demon. Vampires that sparkle in the sun? Vampires with souls? Vampires who live in modern-day Staten Island? Bram Stoker made sure future generations had a lot of material to work with.“The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” by Robert Louis Stevenson: This gloomy tale set in Victorian times confronts the duality of man, addressing themes of mental illness with a prescient eye to modern times. Another seminal horror story on this list, raising the question: Why are we drawn to darkness, even when it means us harm?“Tales,\" by Edgar Allen Poe: Master of the macabre Edgar Allen Poe has a place in history as a father of American literature and a master of the short story. The fruits of his imagination are still going strong, as one of his stories featured in “Tales,” “The Fall of the House of Usher,” has been adapted multiple times for film and TV."

            "Google Search has built-in tools to help you find high-quality information and make sense of what you’re seeing online. Today, we’re announcing three new ways you can get more context about the images and sources you’re finding.",
            "About this image is now availableEarlier this year, we announced a new feature called About this image, and today, this feature is rolling out to English language users globally in Google Search. About this image gives people an easy way to check the credibility and context of images they see online. Here’s what you can discover with this tool:An image’s history: You’ll be able to see when an image or similar images may have first been seen by Google Search, and whether it was previously published much earlier on other webpages. This can be helpful if an image is being taken out of context and shared in relation to a current event, but it’s actually much older.How other sites use and describe the image: You can see how an image is used on other pages, and what other sources, like news and fact checking sites, have to say about it. This information can be helpful to assess the claims being made about an image, and to see evidence and perspectives from other sources.An image’s metadata: You’ll be able to see metadata - when available - that image creators and publishers have added to an image, including fields that may indicate that it has been generated or enhanced by AI. All Google AI-generated images will have this markup in the original file",
            "Now, with About this image, you can see that crooked house is actually real, and not a digital illusion. (But you still might want to book those tickets to Poland to see it for yourself, just to be sure!)You can access this tool by clicking on the three dots on an image in Google Images results, or by clicking “more about this page” in the About this result tool on search results. We’ll add more ways to access it in the coming months.",
            "Fact Check Explorer adds image searchingFact Check Explorer gives journalists and fact checkers a deeper way to learn about an image or topic. Powered by claim review mark up (which helps Google detect and display a fact check), Fact Check Explorer lets users find fact checks which have been investigated by independent organizations from around the world.This summer, we released a global beta version which lets you upload or copy the URL of any image into the Fact Check Explorer and see if it has been featured anywhere in an existing fact check. This version also provides an overview of the different contexts associated with the image and their evolution over time. Since we released this version, over 70% of our beta users reported the new image features helped reduce their investigation time into an image, helping them bring image fact checks online quicker.",
            "One key request we’ve received from testers was better integration with their in-house fact-checking solutions. Today we’re announcing a beta of Image Search functionality in FactCheck Claim Search API: Soon, approved journalists and fact checkers will be able to search the fact-check image corpus on Fact Check Explorer via an API and integrate the knowledge into their own solutions. This will make it even easier for them to investigate images and build unique products for their readers.",
            "Search Generative Experience powers more information about sourcesOne of the best ways to evaluate information online is to learn more about the source. Say you stumble upon some cool new hiking boots, but they’re from a small merchant you’re not familiar with. You might want to do research on the seller – but in some cases, it can be hard to find information about lesser-known sites. Now, we’re starting to experiment with how generative AI can do some of that digging for you, to help you search with confidence.For people who are opted-into Search Generative Experience (SGE) through Search Labs, you’ll now be able to see AI-generated descriptions of some sources, supported by information on high-quality sites that talk about that website. We’ll showcase links to these sites in the AI-generated description of the source.These AI-generated descriptions of the source will show up in the “more about this page” section of About this result for some sources where there isn’t an existing overview from Wikipedia or the Google Knowledge Graph. At this stage, we’re starting small in exploring how this technology can be useful to support and supplement our existing information literacy efforts.Having easily accessible tools to help people verify what they see online has never been more important. Seven in ten (70%) respondents to a 2023 study led by the Poynter Institute’s digital media initiative MediaWise reported not being totally or very confident in their ability to tell when online images are authentic and reliable.Whether you’re checking to learn more about a crooked house or get context about a source you’re reading, we’re dedicated to building the tools and resources to help you feel more confident about navigating what you’re seeing online."

            "Search has long been a place where you can find information to help with life’s questions — whether they’re big or small. And with advances in AI, we’ve continued to develop simpler and smarter ways to help you uncover useful insights and make sense of information.As we continue to experiment with bringing generative AI capabilities into Search, we’re testing new ways to get more done as you’re searching — like creating an image that can bring an idea to life, or getting help on a written draft when you need a starting point.Just picture it: Create images with generative AIThere are times when you might be looking for a specific image, but you can’t find exactly what you have in mind. Or maybe you have an idea that you need help visualizing. So beginning today, we’re introducing the ability to create images with our generative AI-powered Search experience (SGE).Let’s say you want to make a card for a friend who loves to cook and whose favorite animal is a capybara. If you search for something like “draw a picture of a capybara wearing a chef’s hat and cooking breakfast,” SGE will provide up to four generated images in the results.Tap on any of those images and you’ll see how generative AI has expanded your initial query with descriptive details, like “a photorealistic image of a capybara wearing a chef’s hat and cooking breakfast in a forest, grilling bacon.” From there, you can edit the description further to add even more detail and bring your vision to life. Maybe you want to see the capybara chef making hash browns instead, or you want to add a light blue background with clouds. That’s an easy change!",
            "If you’re opted in to SGE, you may also see an option to create AI-generated images directly in Google Images, as part of this experiment. This feature is designed to appear when you’re searching for inspiration, like “minimalist halloween table settings” or “spooky dog house ideas.”",
            "While AI can open new and exciting possibilities, we also recognize the need to introduce this technology in a responsible way. That’s why we’re building safeguards into this experience and blocking the creation of images that run counter to our prohibited use policy for generative AI, including harmful or misleading content. And every image generated through SGE will have metadata labeling and embedded watermarking to indicate that it was created by AI. The image generation capability is only available in English in the United States, to people who opted into the SGE experiment and who are 18 years or older.We also have an upcoming tool called About this image that will help people easily assess the context and credibility of images. For example, it might show you when a similar version of this image may have first been seen by Google; or show you other pages on the web that use a similar image, including news or fact checking sites.Search for inspiration with SGESometimes when you’re researching a project or topic in Search, you end up looking for writing ideas and inspiration along the way. To help with these longer-running searches, we’re introducing written drafts in SGE. You’ll be able to make the draft shorter, or change the tone to be more casual.For example, perhaps you’re looking into home improvement projects, like how to convert your garage into a home office. After finding helpful ideas across the web and contractors you’d like to get in touch with, you can ask SGE to “Write a note to a contractor asking for a quote to turn my garage into a home office.”From there, it's easy to export your draft to Google Docs or Gmail when you’re ready to add that personal touch. And rest assured that Google Workspace privacy protections carry over into this export functionality.This new capability will allow you to get even more help as you search and will begin rolling out today to those opted into the SGE experiment in English in the U.S.",
            "We believe that generative AI in Search can help spark inspiration and help you get even more done. We look forward to continued testing and getting user feedback.You can sign up and share feedback on our generative AI experiments through Search Labs in the Google app (Android and iOS), or on Chrome desktop."

            "Responding to climate change calls for systemic, global action to transition to a sustainable future for everyone. But tackling a problem at the scale of climate change can seem intimidating.To help, we’re continuing to develop technology that can surface helpful information so people, cities and organizations can make more sustainable choices. We’ve focused especially on transportation and energy, which are the two sectors that contribute the most to global emissions. Here’s some of the progress we shared today at Sustainable with Google.",
            "TransportationCutting down on traffic and travel emissionsProject Green Light is one of the ways we’re helping improve transportation. The product uses AI to help city traffic engineers optimize traffic lights at intersections to improve traffic flow and cut emissions. With this information, cities can make cost-effective updates to existing infrastructure to reduce the number of stops cars make at red lights.Today, we’re announcing the availability of Green Light in 12 cities across four continents, helping to save fuel and lower emissions for up to 30 million car rides monthly. Early numbers from Project Green Light indicate the potential to reduce stops by up to 30% and reduce emissions at intersections by up to 10%.1 We’ll be expanding Green Light to more cities across the globe next year.",
            "Helping people get from A to B more sustainablyPeople are looking for information about how to reduce their environmental footprint when in transit — from heading to work to picking up groceries. That’s why we’ll start rolling out fuel-efficient routing in Google Maps to India and Indonesia this year — adding to existing availability in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Egypt. Plus, in these two new countries, we’re including fuel-efficient routes for two-wheelers to help even more people travel more sustainably.Fuel-efficient routing uses AI to suggest routes that have fewer hills, less traffic, and constant speeds with the same or similar ETA. Since launching in October 2021, it’s estimated to have helped prevent more than 2.4 million metric tons of CO2e emissions — the equivalent of taking approximately 500,000 fuel-based cars off the road for a year.2To help people find other sustainable modes of transportation, like rail, new train route suggestions will soon appear on Search when you look for flights. And in the near future, in France, when people look up driving directions, Maps will show public transit or walking suggestions next to driving routes if travel times are comparable and practical.",
            "Introducing deeper electric vehicle insights in SearchElectric vehicles (EVs) are another area of transportation where we’re seeing growing interest. In fact, global EV-related searches have nearly doubled over the past two years. For people shopping for an EV, it’s now even easier to understand the costs associated with buying a new vehicle thanks to new insights in Search.In the U.S., when people search for terms like “best electric cars,” they can quickly compare prices, battery range and discover models. They can also find federal government incentives for qualifying vehicles in the U.S., with German and French national incentives coming soon.We’re also adding an updated Fuel Cost Calculator to electric and fuel-based car results to help drivers understand the cost of charging compared with filling up at the pump. This is available now in 21 countries around the world.",
            "Our new battery range explorer shows how far drivers can go with a specific model car on a single charge. Drivers can also customize a route to see how many charges are needed along the way based on factors like elevation change and speed limits. These battery range insights roll out in the U.S. in the coming weeks and in Europe early next year.",
            "Minimizing the impact of long-distance travelAviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Contrails — the thin, white lines you sometimes see behind aircraft — account for roughly 35% of aviation's global warming impact. To mitigate this, Google Research teamed up with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy to combine AI and huge amounts of data to predict where contrails will form and how planes can avoid making them. This trial reduced contrails by 54%.Now, we’re broadening our efforts via a new partnership with EUROCONTROL, the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation. EUROCONTROL will be able to provide aircraft flying through their airspace with information about how to avoid contrails.",
            "EnergySharing information about home cooling and heating optionsTo help with the clean energy transition, we’re working to provide more information about sustainable options for home energy. Making sense of the options can be overwhelming, and people often need a new system on short notice, like when a boiler breaks in the middle of winter or an air conditioning unit stops working during a record-breaking heatwave. To make it easier for people looking for more sustainable heating and cooling options for their homes, we’re updating our Search experience to show energy efficiency information and financial incentives when people search terms like \"heat pumps\" or \"air conditioning\".",
            "Broadening access to tools that accelerate the energy transitionHelping people, businesses and cities source clean energy is also a critical part of the clean energy transition. One of the biggest barriers to bringing more clean energy online is the complex planning process that includes barriers like aging infrastructure and severe weather events that often cause delays. Tapestry, an early Alphabet project, has developed AI-powered tools for grid mapping and planning to help governments and utilities efficiently model scenarios, like taking a coal-based plant offline or how an extreme weather event could impact clean energy sources. With Tapestry’s technology, Coordinador Eléctrico Nacional (CEN), Chile’s national system operator, can simultaneously run up to 12 times the number of future scenarios as their current tool.",
            "Helping build more sustainable urban areas with solarLastly, to help cities better incorporate solar into their development plans, today we’re introducing a new feature in Google Earth. This capability will make it easier for planners to determine the best building designs and solar options for urban areas. It’s especially helpful when optimizing designs for places with ample space, like parking lots. As we continue working toward a carbon-free world, making solar technology more accessible for cities and organizations will be key to reducing global emissions.",
            "There’s more momentum than ever behind efforts to reduce global emissions, and there are so many opportunities to make an impact in areas like transportation and energy. Whether it’s using fuel-efficient routing on the road or designing cities to minimize emissions, our tools share helpful information that enables people to make sustainable decisions. Technology — especially breakthroughs in AI — will advance progress toward a sustainable future."

            "When I set out to create the Aks Foundation, the vision was simple: a safe space for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault to be heard without being judged, to make their own choices and feel validated. At the time, there weren’t any 24/7 crisis hotline numbers in India — and I knew that needed to change. And thanks to a partnership with Google, our helpline is reaching people across the country.Back when I was studying to get my masters in the U.S., I worked with a crisis center for domestic violence and sexual abuse. There, I learned about what kind of counseling survivors could really benefit from and when I returned to India, I wanted to bring that same model back home. Four years later, thanks to a team of truly incredible hardworking passionate people, the Aks Crisis Intervention and Prevention Plan was born.Aks has a 24/7 crisis line, a legal line for assistance and community education programs for prevention purposes. Unfortunately, survivors of abuse are often silenced and face isolation from society. Having the resources to feel supported and empowered to make choices for oneself can make a world of difference for an individual.",
            "We’re still a small team with limited resources, and what we needed was a better way of reaching those who needed our help. So when Google reached out to us in 2022 asking if we wanted to partner and elevate our hotline information, it was the perfect opportunity.For over a decade, Google has worked closely with crisis support providers to help people navigate topics like suicide, substance use disorders and domestic violence. In addition to returning helpful information from reliable sources for related queries, they work with local crisis partners to surface high-quality information around the world. Now, when people in India search for information related to domestic violence on Google, they will see a box at the top of the search results displaying the contact information for the 24/7 Aks Crisis Line. Since then, we’ve been receiving almost five times as many calls as we were getting before.",
            "Once, we got a call from an 18-year old mother who told us that she found our number on Google. Married off at age 15 to an abusive husband, she was constantly suffering violence from him. One night, he threw her out of the house and kept her away from her baby. When she went to the hospital, she was frightened and felt powerless, with nowhere to go. Fortunately, she found our number and called us. We were able to get her the help she needed from an NGO local to where she was. They took her in for a few nights, and worked with local authorities to reunite her with her daughter. Her story has a happy ending: she now provides live-in domestic help for an elderly couple who happily took her and her daughter in.",
            "Google Search has helped put us on the map and help people who might never have discovered us otherwise. The one thing taken away from survivors is choice — and Aks Foundation gives them a place where they can call at any time of the day, be heard without judgment and make their own choices. My hope is that one day, we’ll live in a world in which no survivor will ever have to feel alone."

Since then, more and more people have tested it out and provided valuable feedback, helping us understand the many ways people find these capabilities helpful in Search, and where there’s room for improvement.Here’s one example: We’ve seen that younger users – those aged 18-24 who currently have access to SGE – are finding this experience especially useful. They’ve given us particularly positive feedback about how these capabilities make it possible to search for information in a more conversational, natural way, and ask follow-up questions.Today, we’re opening up access to SGE in Search Labs to more people — specifically, teens (13-17) in the U.S. — so they too can benefit from the helpful capabilities generative AI has to offer. And as we bring SGE to more people, we’re continuing to deepen our investment in quality and safety, rolling out important updates and tools that improve the experience and help people find useful, reliable information.",
            "Unlocking generative AI in Search for teensStarting this week, teens ages 13-17 in the U.S. signed into a Google Account will be able to sign up for Search Labs to access select Labs experiences through the Google app or Chrome desktop. This includes access to SGE, which can help people find information faster and more naturally and explore topics of interest, as well as SGE while browsing web pages.Generative AI can help younger people ask questions they couldn’t typically get answered by a search engine and pose follow-up questions to help them dig deeper. As we introduce this new technology to teens, we want to strike the right balance in creating opportunities for them to benefit from all it has to offer, while also prioritizing safety and meeting their developmental needs. Informed by research and experts in teen development, we've built additional safeguards into the experience. SGE's quality protections are designed to prevent inappropriate or harmful content from surfacing. For example, we’ve put stronger guardrails in place for outputs related to illegal or age-gated substances or bullying, among other issues. And as we gather even more feedback, we will continue to improve how our systems respond, working with experts along the way to better protect teens.",
            "Teens and parents interested in trying out these new features in Search Labs can read our new AI Literacy Guide, which addresses key questions about how generative AI works, its capabilities and its limitations, as well as tips for how teens and families can use it responsibly. Teens will see a link to the guide as part of the onboarding process for available experiences in Search Labs, and it can also be found in the Search Help Center. As this technology evolves, we’ll continue to find additional ways to facilitate learning and exploration in a responsible way.",
            "Giving people more contextOn Search, we’ve built information literacy features to help people evaluate the reliability of information and sources they find online. Now, we’re bringing dedicated information literacy tools directly into SGE.Starting today, we’re rolling out About this result in SGE, so people who have opted into Search Labs will be able to use this tool on AI-powered responses. This will give people helpful context, such as a description of how SGE generated the response, so they can understand more about the underlying technology. Soon, we’ll also add About this result to the individual links that are included in SGE responses, so people can understand more about the web pages that back up the information in AI-powered overviews.",
            "SGE is designed to highlight web pages and content from the web so people can easily explore more, and also check additional sources to get more context or facts. We also recently rolled out an update that makes it easier for people to see the web pages that back up the information in AI-powered overviews, so they can evaluate what they’re finding. As we update SGE, Search ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the page.",
            "Making targeted improvementsSGE is rooted in the Search quality and safety systems we’ve been honing for years, which are designed to surface trustworthy, high-quality information. But just as we’re always working to improve Search, we’re taking the same approach with SGE. We’re using rigorous testing, red-teaming and evaluation to deliver a higher-quality, more helpful experience.One area where we’re making targeted improvements is when a query includes a false or offensive premise – which can result in an AI-powered response that unfortunately appears to validate said premise. That can be the case even if the web pages themselves point to high-quality, reliable information. We’re rolling out an update to help train the AI model to better detect these types of false or offensive premise queries, and respond with higher-quality, more accurate responses. We're also working on solutions to use large language models to critique their own first draft responses on sensitive topics, and then rewrite them based on quality and safety principles. While we’ve built a range of protections into SGE and these represent meaningful improvements, there are known limitations to this technology, and we’ll continue to make progress.Overall, the quality of this experience continues to get better, and we’re working on ongoing and broad improvements, including to better showcase a range of perspectives and information in responses. All these improvements are designed to make the experience more helpful, informative and high-quality for the range of queries we get every day – including ones we haven’t seen before! As more people sign up to use this experiment, we look forward to how their feedback can help us continue to improve."

            "What was the last thing you searched on Google? For me, it was “best snowskin mooncake in Singapore” — a classic treat to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival that is approaching this weekend. No matter what you're searching for, our goal since Google Search launched 25 years ago has remained the same: to deliver the highest-quality information to everyone.And all these years later, as our CEO Sundar Pichai has said: it's still our biggest moonshot, with so much more to do. 15% of searches we see every day are ones we’ve never seen before — meaning we have to constantly improve Search to make sure we’re staying relevant with what people are asking. We make thousands of improvements to Search every year, and particularly with advancements in AI, we are continuing to reimagine what Search can be.As we celebrate our 25th birthday this week, here’s a quick look back at moments along the journey we’ve taken to make Search more helpful for people across Asia Pacific.Search in your languageBack in 1998, Google started as an English-only service. From the start, we knew that helping people all around the world meant we would need to expand it to their languages. So within two years, we were operating in 14 languages including Japanese, Korean, and Simplified and Traditional Chinese. With this expansion, more people could search for content in their preferred language. In fact, just adding these four Asian languages made Search available for 75 million web pages in Asian languages for internet users around the world.But that was just the beginning of our journey in Asia Pacific. When we opened our first office outside the US in Tokyo in 2001, we knew it would become a base to get to know the region better — and for us to improve our products for the people of Asia Pacific. And as we continued to add languages to Search (40+ Asian languages and counting), we saw an opportunity to expand on the results as well. While information in English is widely available online, in other languages it can be difficult to find. Thanks to advances in neural machine learning translation, in 2017 we launched a feature in India to help people access web pages originally written in other languages and read it in their preferred language.New ways to searchText search is where we began, but over time we've continued to create more intuitive ways to help people find information. For example, many people find it easier to speak their thoughts than to write them out — and advances in machine learning allowed us to launch Voice Search in 2008. This is particularly popular in India, where the percentage of Indians using voice search queries each day is nearly twice the global average.And rather than reading, some people find it easier to listen to information — leading us to introduce the ability to listen to search results. We first brought this feature to India in 2021, so people could hear information in Hinglish and five Indian languages. Today, you can even search what you see with your camera, and just recently we launched a Search experiment in Japan and India that uses the power of generative AI to help people understand and explore topics. When we introduced Bard, our conversational generative AI experiment, Korean and Japanese were the first non-English languages we expanded it to.",
            "Local knowledge from trusted partnersOver the years, partnerships have also played an important part in keeping Search locally relevant. From early warnings for extreme weather alerts to health information during the COVID pandemic, we work closely with organizations across the region to get people the right information at the right time. During the 2019 elections in India and Indonesia, we helped voters navigate the registration and voting processes by collaborating with local election commissions. Flood forecasting started as a pilot in partnership with Indian and Bangladeshi governments — and its success led us to scale the feature to other countries around the world.Particularly in times of need, we want to make it as simple as possible for people to get results in a timely manner. Partners like ThroughLine (headquartered in New Zealand), the largest verified network of mental health and crisis helplines around the world, help us surface the highest-quality information when it matters most. As another example, our work with partners like Japan’s Medical Note Co. helps people find doctor-verified information about common diseases.Partnerships can also be about small moments of delight. We’ve collaborated with iconic Asian brands like Japanese video game companies Sega and Bandai Namco Entertainment to create special “easter eggs”. So when you searched for “Sonic the Hedgehog” or “Katamari”, you would see an animated Sonic figure — or a mini version of the Katamari Damacy game (try it out for yourself!). And of course, our BTS easter egg left KPop fans all over the world in “24/7 Heaven”.",
            "From making information more accessible across languages to working with trusted partners for their expertise, it’s been inspiring to see how Search has helped people across Asia Pacific. Whether it’s building in emerging technologies like generative AI or exploring new non-text ways of querying, I’m looking forward to seeing what we’ll bring to Search in the years to come."

But quickly, Google Search became known for our ability to help connect people to the exact information they were looking for, faster than they ever thought possible.Over the years, we’ve continued to innovate and make Google Search better every day. From creating entirely new ways to search, to helping millions of businesses connect with customers through search listings and ads (starting with a local business advertising via AdWords in 2001), to having some fun with Doodles and easter eggs — it's been quite a journey.For our 25th birthday, we’re looking back at some of the milestones that made Google more helpful in the moments that matter, and played a big role in where Google is today. Learn more about our history in our Search Through Time site.",
            "2001: Google ImagesWhen Jennifer Lopez attended the 2000 Grammy Awards, her daring Versace dress became an instant fashion legend — and the most popular query on Google at the time. Back then, search results were just a list of blue links, so people couldn’t easily find the picture they were looking for. This inspired us to create Google Images.2001: “Did you mean?”\"Did you mean,\" with suggested spelling corrections, was one of our first applications of machine learning. Previously, if your search had a misspelling (like “floorescent”), we'd help you find other pages that had the same misspelling, which aren't usually the best pages on the topic. Over the years we’ve developed new AI-powered techniques to ensure that even if your finger slips on the keyboard, you can find what you need.",
            "2002: Google NewsDuring the tragic events of September 11, 2001, people struggled to find timely information in Search. To meet the need for real-time news, we launched Google News the following year with links to a diverse set of sources for any given story.2003: Easter eggsGooglers have developed many clever Easter eggs hidden in Search over the years. In 2003, one of our first Easter eggs gave the answer to life, the universe and everything, and since then millions of people have turned their pages askew, done a barrel roll, enjoyed a funny recursive loop and celebrated moments in pop culture.",
            "2004: AutocompleteWouldn’t it be nice to type as quickly as you think? Cue Autocomplete: a feature first launched as “Google Suggest” that automatically predicts queries in the search bar as you start typing. Today, on average, Autocomplete reduces typing by 25% and saves an estimated over 200 years of typing time per day.2004: Local informationPeople used to rely on traditional phone books for business information. The web paved the way for local discovery, like \"pizza in Chicago\" or \"haircut 75001.\" In 2004, Google Local added relevant information to business listings like maps, directions and reviews. In 2011, we added click to call on mobile, making it easy to get in touch with businesses while you’re on the go. On average, local results in Search drive more than 6.5 billion connections for businesses every month, including phone calls, directions, ordering food and making reservations.2006: Google TranslateGoogle researchers started developing machine translation technology in 2002 to tackle language barriers online. Four years later, we launched Google Translate with text translations between Arabic and English. Today, Google Translate supports more than 100 languages, with 24 added last year.",
            "2006: Google TrendsGoogle Trends was built to help us understand trends on Search with aggregated data (and create our annual Year in Search). Today, Google Trends is the world’s largest free dataset of its kind, enabling journalists, researchers, scholars and brands to learn how searches change over time.2007: Universal SearchHelpful search results should include relevant information across formats, like links, images, videos and local results. So we redesigned our systems to search all of the content types at once, decide when and where results should blend in, and deliver results in a clear and intuitive way. The result, Universal Search, was our most radical change to Search at the time.2008: Google Mobile AppWith the arrival of Apple's App Store, we launched our first Google Mobile App on iPhone. Features like Autocomplete and \"My Location\" made search easier with fewer key presses, and were especially helpful on smaller screens. Today, there’s so much you can do with the Google app — available on both Android and iOS — from getting help with your math homework with Lens to accessing visual translation tools in just a tap.2008: Voice SearchIn 2008, we introduced the ability to search by voice on the Google Mobile App, expanding to desktop in 2011. With Voice Search, people can search by voice with the touch of a button. Today, search by voice is particularly popular in India, where the percentage of Indians doing daily voice queries is nearly twice the global average.",
            "2009: Emergency HotlinesFollowing a suggestion from a mother who had a hard time finding poison control information after her daughter swallowed something potentially dangerous, we created a box for the poison control hotline at the top of the search results page. Since this launch, we've elevated emergency hotlines for critical moments in need like suicide prevention.2011: Search by ImageSometimes, what you’re searching for can be hard to describe with words. So we launched Search by Image so you can upload any picture or image URL, find out what it is and where else that image is on the web. This update paved the way for Lens later on.2012: Knowledge GraphWe introduced the Knowledge Graph, a vast collection of people, places and things in the world and how they're related to one another, to make it easier to get quick answers. Knowledge Panels, the first feature powered by the Knowledge Graph, give you a quick snapshot of information about topics like celebrities, cities and sports teams.",

            "2019: BERTA big part of what makes Search helpful is our ability to understand language. In 2018, we introduced and open-sourced a neural network-based technique to train our language understanding models: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT makes Search more helpful by better understanding language, meaning it considers the full context of a word. After rigorous testing in 2019, we applied BERT to more than 70 languages.",
            "2020: Shopping GraphOnline shopping became a whole lot easier and more comprehensive when we made it free for any retailer or brand to show their products on Google. We also introduced Shopping Graph, an AI-powered dataset of constantly-updating products, sellers, brands, reviews and local inventory that today consists of 35 billion product listings.2020: Hum to SearchWe launched Hum to Search in the Google app, so you’ll no longer be frustrated when you can’t remember the tune that’s stuck in your head. The machine learning feature identifies potential song matches after you hum, whistle or sing a melody. You can then explore information on the song and artist.",
            "2021: About this resultTo help people make more informed decisions about which results will be most useful and reliable for them, we added \"About this result\" next to most search results. It explains why a result is being shown to you and gives more context about the content and its source, based on best practices from information literacy experts. About this result is now available in all languages where Search is available.2022: MultisearchTo help you uncover the information you’re looking for — no matter how tricky — we created an entirely new way to search with text and images simultaneously through Multisearch. Now you can snap a photo of your dining set and add the query “coffee table” to find a matching table. First launched in the U.S., Multisearch is now available globally on mobile, in all languages and countries where Lens is available.",

            "There’s a lot that goes into building a search engine. While it seems simple enough — you type a question, and we find results that match — we've taken on many deep, technical challenges to make Google what it is today.And the reality is that Search is never a solved problem. Old challenges evolve and new challenges are constantly popping up — because the internet and the world are always changing.So let’s take a look back at some of the biggest technological breakthroughs we’ve made — and where we’re continuing to push the boundaries of innovation — as we build and improve Google Search.",
            "1. Delivering quality resultsIt’s important that we rank information not only based on what’s relevant to your query, but also what’s likely to be helpful and reliable. This insight was what set Google apart from day one: Our PageRank algorithm didn’t just take into account whether words on a page matched. It looked at how sites linked to one another as a clue about which pages were important or authoritative.We’ve adapted our techniques over the years as the web has evolved, and as technology has improved. For example, with the rise in misinformation, we’ve developed ways to understand if topics might be more susceptible to unreliable content, like conspiracy theories or medical misinformation, and orient our ranking more towards authoritativeness in those moments.",
            "We do hundreds of thousands of quality evaluations every year to make sure we’re meeting our high bar for quality. We’ll regularly make broad updates to our systems, called core updates, as well as more specialized updates, like our helpful content update, to continue to deliver useful results.There are dimensions of information quality that continue to evolve and require novel approaches. For example, one known challenge is information gaps, also known as “data voids,” in which high-quality information just might not be available. We’ve come up with ways to show notices when topics are rapidly evolving or when we don’t have high confidence in the quality of results, cautioning that people should approach these results with greater scrutiny. We’ve also invested in other information literacy tools that help people check sources and get context, to evaluate what they’re finding.",
            "2. Deciphering meaningInformation understanding — both understanding the meaning behind people’s queries and understanding documents from the web — has been a critical focus area for Google over the years. Early on, our systems were largely built on simple word matching. But that’s where things like spelling became really important. At the time, if you spelled something incorrectly, you’d only find pages that spelled the word wrong, too! So we built our first machine learning system in Search to tackle this challenge.Over the years, our systems became much more sophisticated, understanding synonyms and the context of words better. Breakthroughs like the Knowledge Graph helped us understand how people, places and things in the world relate to each other — understanding the world more like people do — so we can get you exactly what you’re looking for, and even take the next step. For example, searching for the hottest new movie and getting facts about the cast and running time, along with theaters near you and links to buy tickets.",
            "Large language models like BERT, developed by the Google Research team, have helped us take huge leaps forward in deciphering natural language queries and understanding web documents, so we can deliver more relevant results across languages used around the world. Such models can take lessons from one language and apply them to others, so we can return better results in the many languages that Search is offered in. And we’ve built tools like Google Translate to help break down language barriers for people, so they can understand more of the world’s information.The latest generative AI technology and large language models can help us reimagine Search, unlocking new types of questions and transforming the way we organize information. We’re currently experimenting with applying generative AI to our Search experience through Search Labs, and we’re rapidly updating the experience as we explore what’s possible.",
            "3. Understanding images, videos and moreThere’s so much information in the world that isn’t text, and so many ways to ask for things that aren’t by typing words into a search box.By applying the latest developments in natural language processing (NLP), in 2008 we launched the ability to search with your voice, making it more natural to search on mobile.In 2015, advances in computer vision made it possible to search what you see with Lens. We turned your mobile phone camera into a way to explore and ask questions about the world around you, so you can learn more about that flower or insect you saw while you were out for a walk in your neighborhood. Today, people do more than 12 billion visual searches every month with Lens.Last year, we launched multisearch, which advanced these capabilities to allow you to add text to your visual searches. Now, you can do things like take a picture of a couch you like, add the word “chair,” and Google will use the image and word to show you similar pieces to add to your living room set.Breakthroughs with AI have also enabled us to understand the semantics of videos to automatically identify key moments – allowing you to navigate those moments like chapters in a book. Whether you’re looking for that one step in a home renovation tutorial, or a game-winning shot in a highlight reel, you can get to what you’re looking for.",
            "4. Spotting and stopping spamAnyone who has ever looked into their email spam folder can appreciate all the work that goes into keeping that junk out of your inbox. On Search, we’ve built advanced systems to fight spam in the same way. Without our advanced protections, search results would be clogged with completely irrelevant information, phishing attempts and links to malware.We constantly develop new techniques and implement updates to our ranking systems to protect against spam. But spam also adapts and evolves, requiring constant attention from our teams.In recent years, we’ve applied new AI-powered techniques to spam detection, which has helped us keep search results over 99% spam free. This remains a big area of investment for us: As long as people come to Google looking for information, spammers will be trying their hand at getting around our protections, so we have to stay vigilant and one step ahead.",
            "5. Making Search saferOver the years, we’ve maintained a strong commitment to our principles of maximizing access to information, while helping people stay safe and in control. We aim to help people find information that’s within the bounds of legal expression, while not inadvertently exposing them to low-quality or harmful content that they haven’t asked to see.We’ve approached this both through expanding our policy protections for people to remove sensitive personal information from our results, and through improving our ranking systems with safety and inclusivity in mind.For example, we’ve launched improvements to reduce unwanted explicit content from ranking highly in Search and updates to blur explicit imagery by default, and ranking improvements to limit the reach of sites that use exploitative practices. Meanwhile, we’ve updated our policies so that people under the age of 18 can have images of themselves removed from Search, and launched new tools like Results about you to make it easy to control how your personal information shows up in search results.",
            "Billions of people rely on Google for information, so there’s always something more we can do, and new questions that we can help people with. That’s why we’re always working to make Search better every day."

            "Editor’s note: Google will officially celebrate our 25th birthday later this month. To kick off celebrations, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai reflects on our first quarter century, including the questions and technological advancements that led to our biggest breakthroughs and most helpful products. He also shares some thoughts on the opportunity we have with AI to do things that matter on an even bigger scale.To everyone around the world who uses our products, our employees, and our partners:This month, Google will celebrate our 25th birthday. It’s a huge privilege to reach this milestone, made possible by the people who use our products and challenge us to keep innovating, the hundreds of thousands of Googlers past and present who have given their talents to building those products, and our partners who believe in our mission as much as we do.It’s a time for some gratitude, and a moment to reflect.I’ve been thinking a lot about how far technology has come over the last 25 years and how people adapt to it. Years ago, when I was studying in the U.S., my dad — who was back in India — got his first email address. I was really excited to have a faster (and cheaper) way to communicate with him, so I sent a message.And then I waited…and waited. It was two full days before I got this reply:“Dear Mr. Pichai, email received. All is well.”Perplexed by the delay and the formality, I called him up to see what happened. He told me that someone at his work had to bring up the email on their office computer, print it out, and then deliver it to him. My dad dictated a response, which the guy wrote down and eventually typed up to send back to me.Fast forward to a few months ago: I was with my teenage son. He saw something interesting, took some quick pictures and shared them with his friends. Then they exchanged a few messages, and it all seemed faster than the time it would take me just to pull out my phone.How I communicated with my dad all those years ago compared with how my son communicates today shows just how much change can happen across generations. Technology that takes us years to adapt to is second nature for our kids. Ideas my dad marveled at as science fiction — taking a call from your watch, or telling your car to play your favorite song — make my children shrug.Those shrugs give me great hope for the future. They set a high bar for what the next generation will build and invent...and I can’t wait to see what will make their children shrug, too.An essential truth of innovation is that the moment you push the boundary of a technology, it soon goes from extraordinary to ordinary. That’s why Google has never taken our success for granted.It all started with a searchLarry and Sergey first wrote down our mission 25 years ago: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. They had an ambitious vision for a new kind of search engine to help people make sense of the waves of information moving online. The product they built, Google Search, went on to help billions of people around the world get answers to their questions.For a few years, I was one of those people experiencing Google like any other user of the web. I remember feeling blown away by Google’s ability to find the best answer for the most esoteric questions, from a tiny detail buried in a store’s customer service page to an obscure football rule.The questions I’ve asked Google have evolved over time: “How do you fix a dripping faucet?” “Fastest route to Stanford Hospital?” “Ways to calm a crying baby?” And right around spring of 2003, perhaps: “How to ace a Google interview?” And over time, Google got much better at answering them.It’s been inspiring to see what people have done with the answers to their questions, be it to find health care or comfort in difficult times, learn new skills, pursue new career paths, or start new businesses. The idea that a student in rural Indonesia could access the same information as a professor at Stanford was revolutionary, and has changed lives and our world for the better. It’s opened up access to education and entrepreneurship like nothing else before it, or since.Search also laid the foundations for Google to make an economic impact beyond our own walls. Our advertising platforms and tools started out with a premise as simple as Search itself: to help businesses reach customers who were already looking for the kinds of products and services they offer. It was a platform that appealed to small businesses in particular, like the mail-order business selling lobsters that was the first to sign up. And also like Search itself, the ability for any business to advertise online has had a truly transformational impact, helping millions of businesses become part of the digital economy.A quarter century of questionsSearch is still at the core of our mission, and it’s still our biggest moonshot with so much more to do.Of course, Google today is more than a search box. We have 15 Google products that each serve more than half a billion people and businesses, and six that serve more than 2 billion users each.Like most Google searches, all those products started with a question, too. With Gmail it was Could we offer 1 GB of storage to every person? In 2004, when Gmail launched, that volume of storage was over 100X what most other free webmail services were offering!Then a few years later, we saw an opportunity to dramatically improve web browsers — and in turn the web — for people everywhere. So with Chrome we asked: Could we build a browser that made the web better, with simplicity, speed, and security at its core? Right before launch, I had my own question: Will people use this?YouTube dared to ask: What if we gave everyone a way to share what they know with the world? And today, it’s become a powerful platform for learning and knowledge.The questions have kept coming, and we’ve kept improving and expanding our products with new answers: What if Google Maps enabled people to see every street in the world in detail? What if we built a translation tool that allowed people to access information, and communicate in multiple languages? What if you could search and find all your old photos by simply describing what you wanted to see?We’ve also asked ourselves how we could best share our tools, breakthroughs, and infrastructure with others. Google was built in the cloud from the start, even though we only launched our Cloud business in 2008. Today, Google Cloud has become one of the top enterprise companies in the world. Partners across industries are using Google technology to improve customer support and supply chain efficiency, reduce their carbon footprint, build new applications, and get more done with AI. Like our advertising clients before them, Cloud’s partners are operating better, growing faster and creating jobs, with our help.Of course, not every question we asked ended up as a success. In any 25-year journey, you take a few lumps, learn the lessons and work to do better. Remember Google Wave?We’ve also faced hard questions about our future as a company. In the 2000s it was how long can the web really last? In the 2010s, people asked if we could adapt to the era of mobile computing, and whether search was “over?” Each time, we’ve answered by coming back even stronger. We’ve done this guided by a singular focus on our mission, our belief in applying deep computer science to make people’s lives better, and a healthy disregard for the impossible.A healthy disregard for the impossibleThat healthy disregard is why we’ve been able to take on problems others couldn’t — or wouldn’t. There was, for example, this impossible idea of putting a powerful computer in everyone’s pocket, no matter their income or internet connectivity. Today, Android runs on 3 billion devices all over the world, from the latest foldables to entry-level phones. It’s been at the core of our efforts to make the internet more accessible for everyone, and inspired other, transformative products. Likewise, Chromebooks made computing available to schools all over the world. And Google Pixel puts the best of our latest technology — machine learning-powered cameras, speech recognition, transcription capabilities, tensor chips and more — directly into people’s hands.Which brings us to AI. Google has been investing in AI since almost the beginning. We were one of the first to use machine learning in our products, starting in the early 2000s, for spelling corrections, improving the quality of ads, and showing suggestions and recommendations.Then, in the early 2010s, there was real excitement around deep neural networks. In 2012, a few of us went along to a demo in a meeting room near Charlie’s, our main campus cafe. I remember watching in awe as the Research team showed us the progress they’d made with image recognition, driven by breakthroughs in neural networks. It was the first moment I thought to myself: this is really going to change everything!I had a similar feeling when I saw the groundbreaking, interdisciplinary research happening at DeepMind, focused on understanding the nature of intelligence. This progress deeply influenced my thinking, when I became CEO in 2015, that Google should pivot to be an AI-first company.More questions followed. How to power this new generation of computing? So we invented Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs — which provided dramatic performance improvements of 30X to 80X for machine learning over other hardware at the time, and powered the AlphaGo computer that beat the Go world champion Lee Sedol in 2016. Around the same time, we released our landmark Transformer paper in 2017, which created the neural network architecture that’s the foundation for most of the generative AI and large language models today.Many of these technology breakthroughs have led to some of our most incredible product innovations. Search results for complex queries got much more helpful because of large language models like MUM and BERT. We've created entirely new ways for people to express what they're looking for through voice, images, and even asking questions about what they see with multisearch. Now, generative AI is helping us reimagine our core products in exciting ways — from our new Search Generative Experience (SGE), to “Help Me Write” in Gmail. And earlier this year, we launched Bard, an early experiment that lets people collaborate with generative AI.My favorite moments are seeing how our products can make a difference in people’s lives: Whether it's a busy parent taking a photo of their craft drawer and using Bard to inspire a rainy day project for their kids; a traveler using Lens to translate a train schedule in a foreign country; or, more profoundly, a family able to hear the voice of a man with ALS, thanks to our research on speech recognition and synthesis.Designing products that help people at scale is both a privilege and a responsibility. People have their own questions: Can we trust these new technologies? We think deeply about how to build responsible technology from the start, whether it’s making sure everyone’s information is protected and secure, or keeping people safe from bad actors online.This also includes engaging in the important debates about how those technologies will shape our society, and then finding the answers together. AI is a key part of this. As excited as we are about the potential of AI to benefit people and society, we understand that AI, like any early technology, poses complexities and risks. Our development and use of AI must address these risks, and help to develop the technology responsibly. The AI principles we launched in 2018 are an important part of how we do this. These principles prompt questions like: Will it be helpful to people and benefit society, or could it lead to harm in any way? They also shape our product development and AI applications, and guide us in finding solutions to emerging issues. For example, just last week we introduced SynthID, a tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated images, which will help address an important issue around transparency. We’ll continue to engage with experts and the community to keep learning and improving.Looking aheadAs we look ahead, I’ve been reflecting on the commitment from our original founder’s letter in 2004: “to develop services that improve the lives of as many people as possible — to do things that matter.”With AI, we have the opportunity to do things that matter on an even larger scale.We’re just beginning to see what the next wave of technology is capable of and how quickly it can improve. One million people are already using generative AI in Google Workspace to write and create. Flood forecasting now covers places where 460+ million people live. A million researchers have used the AlphaFold database which covers 200 million predictions of protein structures, helping with advances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic resistance, fight malaria, and more. And we’ve demonstrated how AI can help the airline industry to decrease contrails from planes, an important tool for fighting climate change.Still, there is so much more ahead. Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. It’s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to mobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. It’s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an incredible accelerant of human ingenuity.Making AI more helpful for everyone, and deploying it responsibly, is the most important way we’ll deliver on our mission for the next 10 years and beyond.And now AI will allow us, and others, to ask questions like:How could every student have access to a personal tutor, in any language, and on any topic? How could we enable entrepreneurs to develop new forms of clean energy? What tools could we invent to help people design and create new products and grow new businesses?How can fields like transportation, or agriculture, be reimagined? How could we help communities predict and prepare for natural disasters?As these new frontiers come into view, we have a renewed invitation to act boldly and responsibly to improve as many lives as possible, and to keep asking those big questions.Our search for answers will drive extraordinary technology progress over the next 25 years.And in 2048, if, somewhere in the world, a teenager looks at all we’ve built with AI and shrugs, we’ll know we succeeded. And then we’ll get back to work.Thanks for an amazing 25,-Sundar Pichai"

            "Over the past few months, we’ve been experimenting with bringing generative AI capabilities into Search. We’ve learned a lot from people trying Search Generative Experience (SGE) in Search Labs, and we’ve also added new capabilities, from bringing videos and images into responses to local information and travel recommendations.Now, we’re bringing our generative AI experience in Search (SGE) to more people, making Search Labs available in India and Japan. We’re also making it even easier to find web pages that support information in AI-powered overviews, and sharing insights on what we’ve learned so far.Making generative AI in Search accessible to more peopleThis week, we launched Search Labs in the first countries outside the U.S. — India and Japan — enabling people to opt into SGE to help them better understand topics faster, uncover new viewpoints and insights and get things done more easily.Like in the U.S., people in Japan and India will be able to use generative AI capabilities in their local languages, either by typing a query or using voice input. Unique to India, users will also find a language toggle to help multilingual speakers easily switch back and forth between English and Hindi. And Indian users can also listen to the responses, which is a popular preference. In both countries, Search ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the page.",
            "Now, even more people around the world can use generative AI in Search for everyday help, and we look forward to expanding to even more countries in the future.Learning from our earliest experimentsIn the few months since launching generative AI in Search, we’re finding in our research that people are having a positive experience, and are using SGE for help with more complex queries and entirely new types of questions. We’re also seeing the highest satisfaction scores among younger users (18-24 year olds), who say they enjoy being able to ask follow-up questions conversationally.People tell us they find the suggested follow-up questions beneficial to see examples of how to refine their search, and they’re asking longer and more conversational questions in full sentences because generative AI in Search can help them quickly find what they're looking for. Overall, we’re seeing people try queries that they never may have thought they could search for before, creating new opportunities for Google to be helpful.We’ve also found that people are finding ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful, as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses.Another benefit people appreciate is that this experience is integrated into Search. They like that they can easily scroll and access a broad range of sources on the web, in addition to what they see in the AI-powered snapshot. We’re doing ongoing work to refine our systems to know when SGE is most helpful as an addition to the Search experience.Making it even easier to find relevant informationThis generative AI experience helps people explore a range of perspectives and serves as a jumping-off point to explore web content. We recently shared that we were experimenting with even easier ways for people to discover and visit the web pages that back up the information in AI-powered overviews. During testing, we’ve learned that people find it easier and more understandable when access to these links is presented within the overview itself.So starting today, when you see an arrow icon next to information in an AI-powered overview, you can click to see relevant web pages, and easily learn more by visiting the sites. This is launching first in the U.S. and will roll out to Japan and India over the coming weeks.It’s important to note that generative AI in Search remains an experiment and we’ll continue testing different ways of presenting results and listening to feedback, while prioritizing approaches that continue to drive traffic to relevant websites.",

            "If you want to save money on flights this holiday season, or any time of year, a little bit of planning can go a long way. Most of the time, it’s better to book on the early side, especially when your plans aren’t very flexible. But flight prices do change frequently, and there are often low fares to be found with the right tools (and some perseverance).So for all the thrifty travelers out there, we’re sharing a few new and existing ways Google Flights can help you find a great deal.1. Get new insights on the cheapest time to bookOn Google Flights, you can already see whether current prices for your search are low, typical or high compared to past averages for the same route. But the age-old question remains: Is it better to book now or wait for lower prices to come along?So this week, we’re launching upgraded insights to make that choice a bit easier. For searches with reliable trend data, you’ll now see when prices have typically been lowest to book your chosen dates and destination.",
            "For example, these insights could tell you that the cheapest time to book similar trips is usually two months before departure, and you’re currently in that sweet spot. Or you might learn that prices have usually dropped closer to takeoff, so you decide to wait before booking. Either way, you can make that decision with a greater sense of confidence.2. Turn on price trackingIf you do want to wait for lower fares before you book, price tracking can do most of the heavy lifting for you. When you enable price tracking, we’ll automatically notify you if flight prices drop significantly. You can set up tracking for specific dates, like your best friend’s destination wedding in February. Or, if you’re more flexible, you can turn on “Any dates” price tracking to receive emails about deals anytime in the next three to six months. To enable this feature, make sure you’re logged into your Google account.",
            "3. Snag a price guaranteeOn some flight results, you’ll see a colorful price guarantee badge, which means we’re especially confident the fare you see today won’t get any lower before departure. When you book one of these flights, we’ll monitor the price every day before takeoff, and if the price does go down, we’ll pay you back the difference via Google Pay. These price guarantees are part of a pilot program available for select Book on Google itineraries departing from the U.S.",
            "2023 flight booking trendsOutside of these tools, we’ve gathered other information to help you travel on a budget. Last year, we shared money-saving insights based on historical pricing trends on Google Flights. We ran the numbers again with the latest data1, and most of the tips from 2022 still hold true: Taking a layover or avoiding weekend departures are among the best ways to save on your next flight booking.But things have changed a bit for flights around Christmas and flights to Europe. In both scenarios, you’ll want to book even earlier than usual, especially if you’re heading across the pond. Here’s what we found:Best time to book flights for Christmas: For trips starting in mid-December, you’re most likely to find deals around early October. Average prices tend to be lowest 71 days before departure — a big change from our 2022 insights, which found that average prices were lowest just 22 days before departure. And the typical low price range is now 54-78 days before takeoff.Best time to book flights from the U.S. to Europe: Average prices have been lowest 72 days or more before departure. In other words, average airfares from the U.S. to Europe only tend to increase over time, especially once you’re about 10 weeks from departure. So if you want to dust off that passport, you should book your flight as soon as possible.With these tools and trends, you’ll be more than ready for takeoff. Safe travels!"

            "We launched our generative AI-powered Search experience (SGE) less than three months ago, and we’re encouraged that the early feedback has been positive. Since the initial rollout, we’ve continuously made improvements to make the experience even more helpful. In fact, we recently announced updates including more images and videos in overviews, improvements to how links are displayed and more.Today, we’re sharing a few more upgrades to SGE to help you better learn and make sense of information on the web: whether it’s deepening your understanding of complicated concepts, boosting your coding skills or tracking down details within a complex topic.See definitions within AI-generated responsesWhen you’re researching something new, or looking for an explanation of a concept, you might come across a term you don't understand or just might want more information about. To make this easier, we will soon roll out improvements to our AI-generated responses for various topics or questions related to science, economics, history and more. With this update, you’ll be able to hover over certain words to preview definitions and see related diagrams or images on the topic. From here, you can tap to learn more.",
            "Better understand coding information in AI overviewsWhether you’re a new or experienced programmer, learning more about coding is probably on your running to-do list, and generative AI can be a helpful tool. Starting today, we’ll add new capabilities to SGE so it’s easier to understand and debug generated code.SGE currently provides AI-generated overviews to help with tasks across a number of programming languages and tools. For example, you can find answers to how-to questions, and see suggested code snippets for common tasks. With our new updates, segments of code in overviews will now be color-coded with syntax highlighting, so it’s faster and easier to identify elements like keywords, comments and strings, helping you better digest the code you see at a glance.Use generative AI to learn more easily as you browse the webWhen you’re trying to understand the ins and outs of a new topic, you often need to digest long or complex web pages, and it’s not always easy to hone in on specific details. So starting today, we’re launching an early experiment in Search Labs called “SGE while browsing,” available in the Google app on Android and iOS, and coming to Chrome on desktop in the days ahead. Our aim is to test how generative AI can help you navigate information online and get to the core of what you’re looking for even faster.“SGE while browsing” was specifically designed to help people more deeply engage with long-form content from publishers and creators, and make it easier to find what you’re looking for while browsing the web. On some web pages you visit, you can tap to see an AI-generated list of the key points an article covers, with links that will take you straight to what you’re looking for directly on the page. We’ll also help you dig deeper with “Explore on page,” where you can see questions the article answers and jump to the relevant section to learn more.",
            "We think these capabilities can be particularly helpful when you’re learning something new or complex, but they can also come in handy for other tasks like finding a new recipe or researching a big purchase.\"SGE while browsing\" is designed to show AI-generated key points only on articles that are freely available to the public on the web. It does not provide key points on articles marked as paywalled, and publishers are in control — they can learn more about how to designate their content as free or paywalled in our Help Center. As always, we’ll use this time in Labs to gather feedback and learn what works best for both publishers and users as we evolve this experiment over time.If you're already opted into SGE, you'll automatically have access to this experiment. If you haven’t already opted in,“SGE while browsing” is also available as a standalone experiment in Search Labs. To try “SGE while browsing” on desktop, make sure you have the latest version of Chrome and then visit Labs.These latest capabilities are just some of the ways that we are improving our generative AI experience in Search to make searching for and digesting information easier. You can sign up and share feedback on these experiments through Search Labs in the Google app (Android and iOS), or on Chrome desktop."

            "Today, we're announcing some important new features in Google Search to help you stay in control of your personal information, privacy and online safety.An easier way to find and remove results about youLast year, we launched the Results about you tool to make it easy for you to request the removal of search results that contain your personal phone number, home address or email, right from the Google app or however you access Search. Now, we’ve significantly updated and improved the tool, helping you keep track of your personal contact information in Search and alerting you when we find it, so you can get it removed.",
            "In the coming days, we’ll be rolling out a new dashboard that will let you know if web results with your contact information are showing up on Search. Then, you can quickly request the removal of those results from Google — right in the tool. We’ll also notify you when new results from the web containing your contact info pop up in Search, to give you added peace of mind.You can access this tool in the Google app by clicking on your Google account photo and selecting “Results about you”, or by visiting goo.gle/resultsaboutyou. This tool is available in the U.S. in English to start, and we're working to bring it to new languages and locations soon.More control for your family",
            "Earlier this year, we announced a new safeguard that helps protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. With this update, explicit imagery — such as adult or graphic violent content — will now be blurred by default when it appears in Search results.The new SafeSearch blurring setting is rolling out for all users globally this month. You can adjust your settings and turn it off at any time, unless a guardian or school network administrator has locked the setting.We’re also making it easier to find parental controls directly in Search. Just type in a relevant query like “google parental controls” or “google family link” and you will see a box with information on how to manage your parental controls.",
            "Updated policies on personal explicit imagesWe have long had policies that enable you to remove non-consensual explicit imagery from Search. Now, we’re building on these protections to enable people to remove from Search any of their personal, explicit images that they no longer wish to be visible in Search. For example, if you created and uploaded explicit content to a website, then deleted it, you can request its removal from Search if it’s being published elsewhere without approval. This policy doesn’t apply to content you are currently commercializing.More broadly, whether it’s for websites containing personal information, explicit imagery or any other removal requests, we’ve updated and simplified the forms you use to submit requests. Of course, removing content from Google Search does not remove it from the web or other search engines, but we hope these changes give you more control over private information appearing in Google Search.We know it's important to stay in control of your online experience. These new tools and updates are some of the many ways we’re continuing to make Google the safest way to Search."

We’re constantly working to improve this experience in ways big and small. Here are three recent updates that make SGE even more helpful.1. Get a better understanding through images and videosSometimes, it’s more powerful to understand something by seeing it — so we recently brought images to even more AI-powered overviews. For example, when you search for something like “tiniest birds of prey,” you’ll quickly be able to reference what the bird looks like and get relevant information from the web. And over the next week, you’ll begin to see videos within some overviews where it’s helpful to see something in motion, such as a demonstration of a yoga pose, or how to get stains out of marble.",

And with a new school year comes new decisions — like what classes to take, what extracurriculars to join, and of course, how to decorate your dorm room.In fact, according to a recent survey we conducted with Apartment Therapy Media,1 81% of college students are responsible for deciding decor purchases. So we’ve rounded up some shopping tools to help you easily create your home away from home.1. Preview furniture in your space with ARFurniture is a big purchase, and it’s hard to envision exactly what certain pieces will look like or how they’ll fit in your space. For 77% of college students, design and aesthetics are important factors for outfitting a space, and 84% of students surveyed say it would be very or somewhat helpful to see furniture through augmented reality before buying. AR tools for furniture and decor help you do just that. In Search, just tap product results with the AR icon to see what they would look like in your space.",

Find a specific item with LensTwenty-three percent of surveyed college students say their number one pain point when buying a new item for their space is they can’t find the specific thing they’re looking for. That’s where Lens comes in handy, helping you find home products like furniture and decor from a screenshot or photo. And with multisearch in Lens, you can combine images and text to find exactly what you want. Say you love your friend’s yellow reading chair but want it in beige. Simply upload or take a photo of the chair with Lens, swipe up and tap on the multisearch bar to add the word \"beige.” You’ll see similar chairs in your preferred color, plus options for where to buy.",
            "3. Read reviews from other shoppersEighty-two percent of surveyed college students say that when purchasing items for their living spaces, functionality and comfort are important considerations. When you click on a product, just scroll to see reviews from experts and other shoppers. With the help of AI, we’ll also show you top insights from those reviews so you can easily see, for instance, if a comforter is soft or well-made.",

            "When it comes to sports, Google helps you connect with your favorite athletes, keep track of the latest sports news and see highlights from last night’s games. And though it’s easy to find information about men’s sports, too often women athletes don’t get the attention they deserve — both on and off the field.As a Division I field hockey player, this is personal for me: throughout my career, the coverage and visibility for women’s sports was much smaller than for men’s sports.Over the past few years we at Google have deepened our investment in gender equity in sports, with media and league partnerships aimed at increasing coverage of and visibility for women’s sports. Now, we’re making even more improvements to how we showcase this information. From the breadth of sports and leagues we cover to the depth of data and insights we provide, here’s how our commitment to gender equity in sports is reflected when you search.Featuring women’s sports in SearchWe've expanded coverage of women's competitions in the information boxes you see at the top of the results page to include over 380 leagues. In the last year, we have added more than 110 leagues across women’s soccer, cricket and rugby, making it easier for you to keep up with your team’s latest scores and results. Through partnerships with broadcasters and rights holders, we've also been able to provide easy access to live streams and highlights directly from the Search results page. This includes the WNBA and UEFA Women's Champions League, Women's Premier League in India and Liga MX Femenil in Mexico.",
            "Improving our understanding of queriesWe're making ongoing systematic improvements to how we interpret sports queries, making our results more relevant when you’re looking for information on women's sports. These updates have proven helpful for gender-ambiguous queries like “German national soccer team” or “India cricket captain,” for example.Most of the time, our automated systems are able to tell what you’re looking for by the words and context of your query. But there are other times, with these more ambiguous queries, when our systems are unable to tell which team – the men’s or women’s – or which specific person you’re looking for. We have and are continuing to roll out updates to make the features we surface for gender ambiguous queries more inclusive, for example making it easier to switch back and forth between men’s and women’s results for sports tournaments.Now, we’re also taking into account increasing searches around tournaments and other factors, so that our systems are better able to understand what information you’re really looking for. In turn, we can surface features related to women’s leagues and trending events.We’ve also made improvements for people searching in gendered languages like Spanish, German and Hindi, with the intent of making Search results correspond to the gender requested. Queries like “jugadoras de béisbol” (the feminine of baseball players in Spanish) now give more gender-correct responses and a richer experience.As we continue to roll out more improvements and similar experiences for more leagues and competitions globally, we recognize there will still be times when our systems don't get it right – especially given the disparity in content related to men’s and women’s sports that is present on the web. Nevertheless, we remain committed to creating an equitable experience for sports on Search.Helping you find more women’s sports coverageEven though we continue to make progress in this space, we also recognize that there are imbalances across the web in terms of how men and women’s sports are covered. Search results present the content that's available on the open web, so unfortunately, sometimes they can reflect inequities that may exist on the internet — and in society at large. For example, if there's a prevalence of content about men's sports, that might mean Search is more likely to surface such information.That’s why we are also committed to working with content creators and news publishers to increase the amount of relevant, timely and high-quality media coverage of women’s sports. For the FIFA Women’s World Cup™ and in partnership with The Athletic, we will be featuring athlete Megan Rapinoe and other NWSL players in our ongoing My Game in My Words content series. This series, which fans can explore on The Athletic’s site, takes a look at key moments in these athletes careers, their impact and discusses their overall approach to the game.Gearing up for the FIFA Women’s World Cup™Last FIFA Women’s World Cup™ four years ago, we saw the largest spike in Search interest related to women’s soccer in Google Trends history. Since then we’ve seen consistent increases during women’s soccer tournaments like during last year’s UEFA Women’s EURO and the Copa América Femenina. As interest continues to grow, we wanted to create an experience on Search for casual fans and soccer aficionados alike that matched the fandom. These improvements, coupled with a slate of new features on Search, will make it so everyone can access key information right when they need it. Fans from around the world will be able to stay up to date on all the games by checking scores, following teams, getting real-time notifications, diving deeper with in-depth stats and even participate in some friendly competition with the Mini Cup Game on Search."

            "The United States celebrates Juneteenth, the country’s newest federal holiday, on June 19. This date commemorates the emancipation of all enslaved people across the country; however, the history of the abolishment of slavery in the United States is a tangled web of politics and war, with the people most affected often the last to be considered.On January 1, 1863, in the third year of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed those enslaved people held in Confederate states. Two years later, in January of 1865, the 13th Amendment was passed by Congress, abolishing slavery across the U.S. But it wasn’t until months after the 13th Amendment passed that notice of the end of slavery reached the farthest corners of the country. On June 19, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger traveled to Galveston, Texas to announce the end of the Civil War, and with it, the end of slavery. The 19th of June – Juneteenth – came to be celebrated, first in Texas, then across the U.S., as the nation’s second Independence Day. President Biden declared Juneteenth an official federal holiday in 2021.As you celebrate this Juneteenth, Google Books has resources to offer at no charge for shared reflection with your friends and family.",

        "article_paragraphs": [
            "If you can see it, you can search it. That’s the simple idea behind Lens, our visual search tool available in the Google app (Android and iOS). With Lens, you can search what you see with your camera, take a picture or a screenshot, or long press an image you see while browsing, and get a range of visual results to explore.As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, and it seems that many people agree: Every month we see more than 12 billion visual searches on Lens.Haven’t tried Lens yet? If you need some motivation, here are our favorite ways that Lens can make your life a bit easier.1. Learn about the things you see as you go about your dayIf you see a cool building or landmark that you don’t recognize, Lens can tell you what you’re looking at and provide links to learn more. Similarly, whether on the road or in your own backyard, it’s not uncommon to discover plants and animals that you can’t quite clock or describe perfectly with words. Lens helps you search what you see and learn all about it — like whether that beautiful plant can grow indoors.2. Search for skin conditionsDescribing an odd mole or rash on your skin can be hard to do with words alone. Fortunately, there’s a new way Lens can help, with the ability to search skin conditions that are visually similar to what you see on your skin. Just take a picture or upload a photo through Lens, and you’ll find visual matches to inform your search. This feature also works if you're not sure how to describe something else on your body, like a bump on your lip, a line on your nails or hair loss on your head. This feature is currently available in select markets.",
            "3. Translate street signs, menus and more into over 100 languagesIf your summer plans involve travel, Lens can help you bridge the language barrier. Using the Translate filter in Lens, you can upload or take a picture, or even just point your camera at the text you want to translate, like a menu or a street sign. Lens will automatically detect the written language and overlay the translation on top of it, directly on your phone screen.4. Get step-by-step help with homework problemsIf you’re stuck on a homework problem in math, history or science, tap the “homework help” filter, then snap a picture, and Lens will share instructions to help you learn how to solve the problem. The homework help feature also enables you to tackle questions in multiple languages, and you can set your preferred language for search results.5. Shop for the products that catch your eyeIf you’re browsing on your phone and notice a product that you’d love to get your hands on — maybe a snazzy pair of walking shoes or a sleek and functional backpack — you can use Lens to find and buy one of your own. Just take a screenshot and select it in Lens, and you’ll get a list of shoppable matches with links to where you can make a purchase. It works the same way if you see something you want to buy while you’re out and about: Point your camera with Lens, snap a pic and you’ll see options from online merchants.6. Or find different versions of those eye-catching productsAbout those snazzy walking shoes — maybe they’d be even better in blue. Multisearch in Lens lets you combine both words and images to find exactly what you’re looking for. In this case, snap a picture of the shoes in Lens and then swipe up to add words to your search (like “blue”). Lens will then show you similar shoes in the color of your choice. This also works with patterns — say you see a fun shirt and would love that pattern for your curtains. Take a pic of the shirt in Lens, swipe up and type “curtains” — and there you have it.",
            "7. Discover delicious food near youMultisearch also works for finding things nearby, like food from local restaurants. Let’s say you stumbled across an image of a dish you’re dying to try, but you’re not sure what it’s called. Just pull up that image in Lens and add the words “near me” to your search; Lens will show you nearby restaurants that serve what you’re looking for.",
            "8. Unleash your creativity with Lens + BardAs we shared at I/O, the power of Lens is also coming soon to Bard, our experiment that lets you collaborate with generative AI. Whether you want to learn more about something you saw, or explore completely new ideas in a more visual way, you can partner with Bard to start that journey. In the coming weeks, you’ll be able to include images in your Bard prompts and Lens will work behind the scenes to help Bard make sense of what’s being shown.",
            "For example, you can show Bard a photo of a new pair of shoes you’ve been eyeing for your vacation, and ask what they’re called. You can even ask Bard for ideas on how to style those gladiator sandals for a complete summer look, and then continue browsing on Search — using the “Google it” button — to explore a wide range of products from retailers across the web."

            "If you’re traveling this summer, there’s a lot to consider. First up, where are you going? Are you driving, hopping on a train or taking a plane? Camping or glamping? And most importantly, what’s on your packing list?Fortunately, Search has a few tools to help you put the pieces together, wherever you may be headed, with some help from AI.Explore the world around youWith generative AI, we’re exploring new ways to take some of the work out of searching, helping you uncover useful insights and make sense of information. While this technology is still experimental, we’re continuing to incorporate feedback and fine-tune our generative AI experiences to introduce new and improved capabilities. Whether you’re booking far-away travel or making local plans for the weekend, our generative AI-powered experience (SGE) in Search Labs is now better equipped to help you research places like restaurants, hotels, or tourist attractions, just in time for summer.We’ve added new capabilities to SGE for local and travel searches, so if you ask detailed questions about a place or destination in Search, you’ll see an AI-powered snapshot that brings together the most helpful information available — not only from across the web, but also from the reviews, photos and Business Profile details that people have submitted to Google for more than 200 million places in the real world. And with all these links and resources right at your fingertips, it’s easy to dive deeper on relevant sites and hear perspectives from a wide range of creators.For example, you might ask if a certain restaurant is good for large groups or whether they’re vegetarian-friendly. Or maybe you want to know when people recommend visiting a particular landmark, so you can avoid the crowds. With this improved experience in SGE, you’ll get useful insights to guide you along the way, so you can spend less time planning and more time enjoying the plans you’ve made.",
            "Shop smarterAnd if you need to buy something that requires extensive research ahead of your summer travels, generative AI in Search can be particularly useful. Maybe you’re looking for a Bluetooth speaker to take on a beach vacation that’s effective, yet portable enough to pack in a carry-on suitcase.",
            "There are dozens of options and considerations, but with a quick search, the AI-powered snapshot will show you noteworthy factors to consider for bluetooth speakers, along with insights and products that fit the bill. You can see product descriptions that include relevant reviews and ratings, up-to-date prices and product images. That’s because this experience is built on Google’s Shopping Graph, which has more than 35 billion product listings — making it the world’s most comprehensive, freshest dataset of constantly-changing products, sellers, brands, reviews and inventory out there. In fact, every hour, more than 1.8 billion listings are refreshed in our Shopping Graph to give you fresh, reliable results.Get organized with Add to SheetsAs you’re planning your trip or keeping track of potential purchases, save some of that “copy and paste” time with our Add to Sheets experiment. Add to Sheets helps you insert a search result directly into a spreadsheet and share with friends, family or anyone you’re collaborating with. It’s your perfect research companion for plotting your summer plans, or keeping track of other information you’ve found on Search.",

And today, we’re happy to announce that this year’s contest winner is sixth grader Rebecca Wu from Washington.Rebecca’s Doodle, “My Sweetest Memories,” — which is on the Google homepage today — reflects her gratitude for her sisters and the memories they’ve created together. I connected with Rebecca to learn more about her passion for art and the inspiration behind her Doodle.How did you start making art?I’ve always loved to create art. I think I started to draw when I was very young and scribbled a big circle on the wall. I can’t really remember that far back but I know it’s always been my passion.Why did you enter the Doodle for Google contest?I entered the Doodle for Google contest for the first time when I was eight or nine after my art teacher introduced it to me. It was fun for me to interpret the prompt and put “Google” in my drawing. I’ve entered it almost every year since, so it’s sort of a yearly thing for me to do now.What was the inspiration behind your Doodle?The inspiration came when I was brainstorming things I was thankful for, and I thought of my sisters. I remembered all our happy moments and decided to make my drawing about how grateful I am for them.Why is gratitude important to you?When I’m grateful for something, I can look beyond the negatives and focus on the positives. This is important to me because I’m happier and more optimistic.How does it feel to be the contest winner?I’m really proud of myself! I’m also grateful to my whole school for supporting me so much. It feels wonderful and also a bit unbelievable since this is such a big accomplishment!Congratulations, Rebecca! Be sure to bookmark the Doodles website for updates about all things Google Doodles."

If you’ve already signed up for the waitlist at labs.google.com/search, you’ll be notified by email when you can start testing Labs experiments, like SGE (Search Generative Experience), Code Tips and Add to Sheets in the U.S. And if you want to opt-in to these experiments, simply tap the Labs icon in the latest version of the Google app (Android and iOS) or on Chrome desktop to sign up. You can also visit the Labs site to check your waitlist status.Once you’re in, the new generative AI powered Search experience will help you take some of the work out of searching, so you can understand a topic faster, uncover new viewpoints and insights and get things done more easily. So instead of asking a series of questions and piecing together that information yourself, Search now can do some of that heavy lifting for you.",

            "1. Easily get up to speed on a new or complicated topic.Maybe you’re starting to map out a decision that you’d typically need to break down into smaller parts, like “Learning ukulele vs guitar.” Search will provide an AI-powered snapshot so you can get help understanding what factors to consider. Another example: If you’re curious to learn more about starting your own company, try looking up “Benefits of incorporating your business before freelancing.” You can quickly get the lay of the land, and then dive deeper with links to articles.",
            "2. Uncover quick tips for your specific questions.Sometimes you have a very specific question in mind, in which you’d benefit from seeing a variety of content from across the web. If you find your favorite old sweater in the back of your closet but quickly realize it needs some freshening up, search for “How to get an old coffee stain out of a wool sweater?” Or if you’re getting ready for an international trip, but need to make sure your documents are up to date, search for “How can I renew my passport quickly?” Now you can easily find pointers for the key info you need to know, or see a range of options available and take the next step with help from the web.",
            "3. Discover a range of products and things to consider while shopping.Say you’re looking for removable wallpaper to spruce up your rental. Simply search for “Peel and stick wallpaper for kitchen” to learn about important factors, like if it’s easy it is to remove, and get a list of stylish options, including price, customer ratings and links to purchase. Or try searching for “Bluetooth speaker for a pool party” to see important considerations for that environment, like water resistance and battery life, and a host of options to choose from.",
            "And if you want to explore further, right under the snapshot, you’ll see the option to “ask a follow-up question” or select a suggested next step, which will take you into conversational mode.This experiment is our first step in adding generative AI to Search, and we'll be making many updates and improvements over time. As we continue to reimagine how we can make it even more natural and intuitive to find what you’re looking for, we’re excited for you to test out these new capabilities and share feedback along the way."

This has been Google’s largest Ad Grants donation to a single organization.WHO has shifted how it uses Google.org Ad Grants to public health topics beyond COVID-19, such as Mpox, mental health, flu, Ebola, and natural disasters. As a result, the organization served over 28 million public service announcements in six languages, resulting in over 2.7 million visits to their website.Today we are announcing that for 2023, Google.org is providing another $50M in Ad Grants to support WHO in continuing their impactful work in public health."

            "The U.S. is facing an extraordinary mental health crisis. Meanwhile, searches for “mental health crisis” continue to climb year after year. In moments of crisis, people need easy access to resources that connect them to the help they need and support from people in their lives. For Mental Health Awareness Month in the U.S., here’s a look at new ways we’re helping people get that support. Plus, the work we’re doing with other organizations to make sure everyone has access to mental health resources.Connect with people you trust in moments of crisisPeople often turn to Google Search in some of their most vulnerable moments. In the context of a crisis, it is critical to instill hope and give simple information that is easy to act on. Suicide prevention information has been visible at the top of relevant search results for years. And last year in the U.S., it was updated to highlight the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, a network of more than 200 state and local call centers funded by the U.S. Department of Health.Now we’re adding additional resources for people in crisis. When someone is in a vulnerable situation, it can be difficult to put this experience into words and know what to say to ask for help. To better support people reaching out to someone they trust, starting soon in the U.S., when someone searches for suicide-related terms, they’ll see a prompt with conversation starters they can send via text message. These pre-written prompts, developed in partnership with the expertise of the International Association for Suicide Prevention, reduce the stigma of reaching out to ask for help, which is shown to help people get support in moments of crisis. The prompts will appear below the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.",
            "Mental health resources for young peopleMental health issues for teenagers are especially prevalent. The CDC has cited suicide as the second-leading cause of death for teens and young adults from the ages of 10 to 34. On YouTube, crisis support resource panels help young people connect with live support from crisis service partners for suicide, self harm and eating disorders.Beyond crisis support resource panels for everyone, we recently updated our approach to eating disorder-related content. In order to protect viewers from harmful content, we’re removing certain content that shows or describes disordered eating behaviors such as binging or purging. We’re also adding age-restriction to videos that are centered on eating disorder recovery to viewers 18 years or older. And the crisis resource panel for eating disorders now appears underneath videos related to eating disorders, in addition to the search results, to reach even more people when they’re watching content on this topic. These changes will help make space for community and recovery, while continuing to protect viewers.",
            "Support for organizations that provide mental health resourcesTo reach as many people as possible, we're expanding our work with mental health organizations — especially those focused on helping certain populations like children and veterans.The Child Mind Institute helps children, adolescents and families struggling with mental health and learning disorders. To help them continue this important work, we’re granting $100,000 to support their day-to-day operations. Additionally, the Child Mind Institute and YouTube are working together to support content tailored for younger people struggling with mental health, such as the #YouGotThis video series for Mental Health Awareness Month. The campaign features celebrities and influencers sharing their own stories about the mental health disorders, doubts, and confusion they faced when they were young.Another way we support these organizations is through Google.org grants and pro-bono support from Googlers participating in a Google.org Fellowship. With the help of a technical team of Google.org Fellows, The Trevor Project used AI to identify and prioritize high-risk contacts while simultaneously reaching more LGBTQ+ young people in crisis.Veterans are another group disproportionately impacted by suicide — and they’re seeking help in record numbers. A team of nine Google.org Fellows are helping ReflexAI build HomeTeam, a tool that will equip more veterans to better support each other and encourage their peers to seek additional support when needed. Taking from evidence-based clinical practices and working with experts in the field, HomeTeam helps veterans learn practical skills, then apply those skills via AI-powered simulations in a private and safe environment.Through the Google.org Ad Grants program, organizations are able to get high-quality, authoritative mental health resources in front of more people. And the WHO is bringing mental health guides in more than 25 languages to communities around the globe, reaching more than 14 million people through donated Google Search ads, resulting in 1 million visits to their website to learn more.It’s always ok to ask for helpThese organizations exist to support people who need mental health help. If you or a loved one are experiencing a mental health crisis, there are resources available to help from Google and many other trustworthy organizations."

            "Have you ever found yourself in this position? You see an image on a website, in your feed, or in a message from a friend — and you think, \"this doesn't feel quite right.\" Is the image being shown in the right context? Has it been manipulated or faked? Where did it come from? When you’re trying to figure out if a piece of information or an image is reliable, having the full story is key.Sixty-two percent of people believe they come across misinformation daily or weekly, according to a 2022 Poynter study. That’s why we continue to build easy-to-use tools and features on Google Search to help you spot misinformation online, quickly evaluate content, and better understand the context of what you’re seeing. But we also know that it’s equally important to evaluate visual content that you come across.That’s why we’re expanding our ongoing work in information literacy to include more visual literacy and help people quickly and easily assess the context and credibility of images. In the coming months, we’re launching a new tool called About this image. Available first in the U.S. in English, you can see important context like:When the image and similar images were first indexed by Google,Where it may have first appeared,Where else it’s been seen online (like on news, social, or fact checking sites)",
            "With this background information on an image, you can get a better understanding of whether an image is reliable — or if you need to take a second look. For example, with About this image, you’d be able to see that news articles pointed out that this image depicting a staged moon landing was AI-generated.You’ll be able to find this tool by clicking on the three dots on an image in Google Images results, searching with an image or screenshot in Google Lens, or by swiping up in the Google App when you’re on a page and come across an image you want to learn more about. Later this year, you'll also be able to use it by right-clicking or long-pressing on an image in Chrome on desktop and mobile.Today we're also announcing that as we begin to roll out generative image capabilities, we will ensure that every one of our AI-generated images has a markup in the original file to give you context if you come across it outside of our platforms. Creators and publishers will be able to add similar markups, so you’ll be able to see a label in images in Google Search, marking them as AI-generated. You can expect to see these from several publishers including Midjourney, Shutterstock, and others in the coming months.",
            "Google Search is built from the ground up to deliver reliable, helpful and high-quality information. And these two new features are just the latest ways we’re helping you make sense of what you find online and keep up with an ever-changing web. For example, with our About this result tool, you can quickly see more information about a source or topic, so you can assess whether you can trust what you’re reading. In March, we announced five new ways that you can use to verify information on Search. And over the past few years we’ve released numerous features and tools as part of ongoing work to empower you with the information you need to determine what you can trust online.We’ll continue to make updates so you can use Google Search to better understand what you’re seeing online quickly and easily."

            "Over the years, content on the web has exploded. There’s so much information to sort through, and so many facts and perspectives to consider when you’re trying to make decisions, big and small.We shared today how we’re using generative AI to reimagine how you navigate this sea of information, organizing information in new ways and helping you explore the best of the web. And when it comes to what’s most helpful out of all the information out there, we know that for so many questions, you want to hear what other people have to say.That’s why, as we transform Search with new AI-powered capabilities, we’re not only continuing to focus on providing quick insights, but also connecting you to the people and perspectives that will help you understand what’s best for you. Today, we’re sharing some updates we’re making to Search to help you easily get to the human experiences that make the web — and the world — so wonderful.Find helpful information from people on forums and social media sitesIn the coming weeks, when you search for something that might benefit from the experiences of others, you may see a Perspectives filter appear at the top of search results. Tap the filter, and you’ll exclusively see long- and short-form videos, images and written posts that people have shared on discussion boards, Q&A sites and social media platforms. We’ll also show more details about the creators of this content, such as their name, profile photo or information about the popularity of their content.",
            "Let’s say you’re moving across the country, and you don’t know anyone who lives there yet. You search for “how to make friends in a new city,” and tap the Perspectives filter, which shows you a page of results with advice from other people, like personal stories told through video, or tips from commenters in a forum thread.You can also access this content through a dedicated Perspectives section that may appear on the results page, which builds on our earlier work to bring more diverse voices to Search. By tapping the “See more” link, you’ll be able to access the same full page of perspectives content that you would by tapping the filter.This update joins a news-related Perspectives feature we recently launched under Top Stories. This feature helps people better understand a news story by surfacing a variety of noteworthy voices and sources.How we help you find the expertise you needIn addition to making it easier to find authentic perspectives, we're also improving how we rank results in Search overall, with a greater focus on content with unique expertise and experience. Last year, we launched the helpful content system to show more content made for people, and less content made to attract clicks. In the coming months, we’ll roll out an update to this system that more deeply understands content created from a personal or expert point of view, allowing us to rank more of this useful information on Search.Helpful information can often live in unexpected or hard-to-find places: a comment in a forum thread, a post on a little-known blog, or an article with unique expertise on a topic. Our helpful content ranking system will soon show more of these “hidden gems” on Search, particularly when we think they’ll improve the results.We’ve also worked to improve how we rank review content on Search – for example, web pages that review businesses or destinations – to place greater emphasis on the quality and originality of the information. You’ll now see more pages that are based on first-hand experience, or are created by someone with deep knowledge in a given subject. And as we underscore the importance of “experience” as an element of helpful content, we continue our focus on information quality and critical attributes like authoritativeness, expertise and trustworthiness, so you can rely on the information you find.A big part of what makes Search so helpful is its ability to connect you to the wisdom and experience of people all around the world. As we bring new advancements to Search, we’ll continue to help you find and explore content from others, whether it takes the form of a 30-second video, a deep-dive article or something in between."

There are lots of factors to consider — from location to reviews to price. And that’s a lot to take in, especially if you’re trying to do all this research on your phone.So this week, we’re introducing an easier way to browse and discover hotels on mobile.

We’ve all thought to ourselves: Should I book now in case the price goes up tomorrow? Or should I wait in case there’s a better deal next week?On Google Flights, you can already see whether current prices are low, typical, or high compared to historical averages. Now, we’re going a step further with a new pilot program for price guarantees in the U.S. If you see a flight with the price guarantee badge, it means we’re confident that the price you see today won’t get any lower before takeoff.",
            "We’ll monitor the price every day until departure, and if it does go down, we’ll send you back the difference via Google Pay. Now you can book with the confidence that you’re not missing out on a great deal.

Visit the Help Center for more details.Discover unique things to doExploring a new destination is often the best part of a trip — whether you’re visiting top attractions or looking for something more off the beaten path. With Google, making these kinds of plans is easier than ever. Just look for an attraction or tour company on Search or Maps, and you’ll find prices directly on their listing, plus a link to book your ticket.

We’re expanding the advisories for quality information gaps to new languages, including German, French, Italian and Spanish in the coming months.Fact checking with European news organizationsAcross Europe, we’re partnering with organizations to deliver fact check training and to share new techniques for combating the spread of misinformation online.In Germany, we’ve expanded our long-running fact check partnership Faktencheck23 with the German Press Agency. Since 2021, over 1,300 journalists from more than 100 German newsrooms have taken part in the training and joined a vibrant fact-checking community. Today, we’re launching the Fact Check Challenge for German-speaking journalists. Journalists can test their knowledge in quizzes about digital research, verification and fact-checking techniques. The winning participants will attend the inaugural Faktencheck23 Summit this autumn in Berlin. More details can be found here.Additionally, Google provided a €25M contribution towards the inaugural European Media Information Fund. So far, 40 projects across Europe have been funded. Initiatives range from increasing the media literacy of a community in Italy by enabling local librarians with new resources and tools to boosting fact checking activities during Czech elections.Access to authoritative content and news is especially critical during times of crisis and war. We partnered with the Lviv Media Forum and the Thomson Foundation earlier this year to provide a four-part training program for Ukrainian news organizations on engaging diaspora audiences and combating misinformation, among other topics. The findings were published in a handbook and distributed for free across the Ukrainian news industry network.Making sure we surface quality information and help users get more context on what they find online is part of our mission to make the world’s information universally accessible. We’re grateful for our fact-checking partners across Europe and will continue our work to make every user feel safer when looking for information online."

            "People come to Google to find information quickly, understand complex topics and to parse facts from fiction. Google Search helps people find high-quality information from around the world, from a variety of diverse and credible sources, and find new perspectives to help them better understand the world. But sifting through all of the content available on the web can feel overwhelming, especially when you're trying to determine what information you can rely on.International Fact-Checking Day on April 2 is a call to action – because in this day and age, nearly everyone has found themselves needing to put on their own fact-checking hat to verify a claim or check a source. Everyone should be empowered with the tools they need to find information they can trust. That’s why we build features to help you evaluate the information you come across online while expanding the range of helpful information you can find. Today we’re sharing how we’re expanding and improving these resources on Google Search.",
            "Learn more with About this result – now available globallyWhen you search on Google, you probably see results from a number of websites and sources that you recognize – maybe it’s your favorite store or a blog you read regularly. But there also might be sites or sources that you haven’t come across before or aren’t as familiar with. To help people evaluate information and understand where it’s coming from, our About this result feature will be available in all languages where Search is available in the coming days. Now, wherever you’re searching, you’ll see three dots next to most results on Google Search. Tapping those three dots gives you a way to learn more about where the information you’re seeing is coming from and how our systems determined it would be useful for your query. With this context, you can make a more informed decision about the sites you may want to visit and what results will be most helpful for you.",
            "Find diverse perspectives on Top Stories with a new featureJust as important as understanding a source you’re seeing in Google Search is discovering a range of sources and perspectives that can help you better understand a news story. As part of our ongoing work to bring more voices into Search that give you more context on what matters most to you, we’re launching a feature called Perspectives. This carousel will appear below Top Stories and showcase insights from a range of journalists, experts, and other relevant voices on the topic you’re searching for. This feature will give you a variety of noteworthy voices on a news topic, complementing the trustworthy reporting you already find on Search to help broaden your understanding. As with all our features for news, we’re committed to bringing you authoritative and trustworthy information. This carousel will launch soon in English in the U.S. and will be available on desktop and mobile.",
            "Understand the source with About this authorAs we surface new voices and perspectives, we want to ensure that people can easily learn more about the authors behind the content they are reading and discover new voices they can trust. We’re expanding About this result to include a new feature called About this author. Now when people tap on the three dots, readers will be able to find more information about the background and experience of the voices we surface on Google Search. We’re launching this feature on Search results in English globally and on our Perspectives carousel in the U.S. in English.Get context with easier access to About this pageWhen you click on the three dots next to a result, you can also learn more information about the source and topic of a particular page. Now we’re making this information even easier to access. Say you’re searching for a rainforest protection organization. Starting today, you can type in the URL of the organization in Google Search and information from About this page will populate at the top of Search. You’ll be able to quickly see how the website describes itself, what others on the web have said about a site and any recent coverage of it. From there, you can evaluate whether you want to visit the website and learn more. This feature is now available globally in English.",

To address these information gaps, Google Search will automatically show content advisories in situations when a topic is rapidly evolving. We recently launched similar advisories, which trigger when our systems simply don’t have high confidence in the overall quality of the results available. Now, we’re expanding the advisories for quality information gaps to new languages, including German, French, Italian, Spanish and Japanese in the coming months.This doesn’t mean that there isn’t helpful information available, or that a particular result is low-quality. These advisories provide context about the whole set of results on the page, and you can always see the results for your query, even when the advisory is present.",
            "Investing in information literacy and fact checkingIn addition to building helpful tools and features, we’re continuing to support education around information literacy. Here are some of the ways we’re doing that:Google is now partnering with the Public Library Association, a division of the American Library Association, to provide training for approximately 1,000 librarians and library staff through the Super Searchers program, a curriculum developed to help build information literacy skills. Librarians will be encouraged to train their patrons across libraries in the U.S. This will expand on last year’s launch through Public Libraries 2030, which to date has trained hundreds of librarians across five European countries.We’re also announcing that Google is partnering with MediaWise at the nonprofit Poynter Institute for Media Studies to expand their Teen Fact-Checking Network, a volunteer program made up of middle and high schoolers who debunk viral misinformation and share media literacy tips. The program will be expanding into Germany and Brazil, where teens will partner with local news organizations to help spread awareness about the importance of media literacy skills. With support from Google, Mediawise and PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs have developed more than 20 lesson plans for middle and high school teachers , to help them teach their students how to build media literacy skills.Finally, last year Google and YouTube announced that we provided a $13.2 million grant to the International Fact-Checking Network to launch a new Global Fact Check Fund. That fund will open in the coming days. The Fund will support more than 130 fact-checking organizations from 65 countries covering over 80 languages. Building on our previous work to address misinformation, this is Google and YouTube’s single largest grant in fact-checking."

            "Health is a company-wide effort at Google. The global reach of our products, services and platforms — coupled with our advanced AI technologies — provide a way to help billions of people live healthier lives.People come to Google with health-related questions hundreds of millions of times a day. They also turn to YouTube, where videos about health conditions were viewed more than 110 billion times globally in 2021. In addition, people want more personalized insights about their own health through wearables and other mobile devices.Today at Google Health’s annual event, The Check Up, we shared updates to how we are bringing high-quality health information to more people, supporting consumers on their health journey, increasing access to personal health insights, and creating new ways for clinicians to continue their education.Information as a determinant of healthWherever you are in the world, access to information is a critical determinant of your health and wellbeing.Currently, Google Search makes it easier to find helpful information about commonly asked questions on U.S. benefits programs, like Medicaid and Medicare. We are also helping people find available healthcare appointments and show which different types of insurance providers accept.Today, we are expanding that work to make sure people can find the right care at the right time. In the U.S., millions of people signed up for Medicaid during the pandemic. At that time, the requirement to re-enroll each year was paused, but that pause is about to expire on March 31. If people fail to re-enroll, they will lose their healthcare coverage. To help support people during this transition, we will make Medicaid re-enrollment information easier to find on Search.Everyone needs care, whether they have coverage, are uninsured or underinsured. To help in these moments, you will soon be able to see providers that identify as community health centers offering free or low cost care.We are also employing new techniques to ensure we are connecting people with high quality, up-to-date information. Our conversational AI technology Duplex has called hundreds of thousands of healthcare providers in the U.S. to verify their information on Google Search. And we’ve used Duplex to verify if providers accept certain Medicaid plans in their state.",
            "We are also working to address major global health challenges like mental health. We know people turn to Google Search for actionable information in a crisis. Today we are announcing a new partnership with ThroughLine in New Zealand, the largest verified network of mental health and crisis helplines around the world. This will increase the number of crisis helplines that appear at the top of search results in additional languages and countries for searches related to suicide, domestic violence and other personal crisis topics.More insights about your health and wellnessPeople want to be more involved in their own health and wellbeing. Metrics and personalized insights they gain across Pixel, Fitbit and Nest can help them do that — from understanding sleep patterns, daily steps, stress levels and more.Later this month we will make more of Fitbit’s Health Metrics Dashboard feature available without a subscription to people using Fitbit with compatible devices in countries where the feature is available. Health Metrics Dashboard helps you uncover changes and trends in your breathing rate, skin temperature, blood oxygen and more. With this update, you will be able to see trends over longer periods of time and get at-a-glance insights about what metrics changed from their baseline.",
            "Removing barriers to medical educationYouTube has been a place for patients and families to find information about their health and connect with broader communities. Additionally, it also helps healthcare professionals expand and refresh their medical knowledge and keep up with the latest research and best practices in clinical care.Now, for the first time, the content on the Harvard Medical School Continuing Education YouTube channel is eligible for clinicians to claim towards their Continuing Medical and Continuing Nursing Education credits.Looking ahead, we're excited to work with the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide best practices for video production and content strategy that will help augment the quality and delivery of impactful learning experiences for health professionals. By lowering barriers to access and leveraging our experience in information sharing, YouTube is working to democratize medical education in a way that hasn’t been possible before.Read more about today’s news from The Check Up on our blogs on AI in Health including our work with Large Language Models and a new developer platform called Open Health Stack."

            "Even if you don’t do math as part of your job, everyone has to crunch numbers in day-to-day life at some point. Depending on your comfort with math, that can be no big deal — or it can be a challenge. As someone who lives with a math-related learning disability, I fall into the latter category. Luckily, I've found a few tools that can help me more easily navigate my day-to-day encounters with math. These tools aren't specifically made for people with disabilities — they're meant to be helpful for everyone. But as someone who has always struggled with math, I'm a fan.",
            "SearchCheck how to say numbers correctlyWhen I see large numbers, it’s hard for me to translate them into words. Whenever there’s a number I’m not quite sure how to spell or say, I just type the number and add “=english” to the end of the search. For example, 1,603,633=english gets the result “one million six hundred three thousand six hundred thirty-three.” This trick is particularly helpful when I have to present or share data in meetings.",

It can even help split the bill evenly with my friends.",

If I want to calculate .84 / .26 X 100, I plug it into search. It’ll not only give me the answer, but will also show me how to solve the problem with confidence.",
            "Google MapsGet around better with Live ViewMy disability doesn’t just impact the way I view numbers or do math, it also affects my sense of direction. I’ll often turn left when I should've gone right and vice versa. Live View in Google Maps helps me visualize my surroundings and orient myself with AR arrows so I’m not wasting time figuring out which direction I should go. As a New Yorker, this feature is particularly helpful when I’m exiting a crowded train station and don’t know which way to walk.Set a reminder to leave on timeBeing punctual can be a challenge for anyone whether or not math is their strong suit. But even when I’ve made the journey before, I tend to arrive too early, or worse, late. Setting a reminder to leave in Google Maps on iOS saves me time and limits stress.

            "There’s no right or wrong way to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Maybe you’re all in on the lovey dovey stuff, or perhaps you prefer something more friend-focused. And — of course — there’s the option of foregoing it entirely, if that’s more your speed.Wherever you find yourself on the Valentine’s Day celebration spectrum, the holiday certainly inspires some interesting search trends every year. Here’s how different Valentine’s Day-related queries have been performing in the U.S. in the lead-up to the big day.Searches for “date night ideas” reached a record high this year. But the most searched date activities differ a bit across the U.S. Who knew escape rooms were so romantic? (Or rage rooms, for that matter — you OK, Idaho?)",
            "2. If you’ve ever liked someone but not been sure if they liked you liked you, you’re not alone. “Does my crush like me?” and “how to get my crush to like me?” are two of the top questions about crushes.3. When it comes to bouquet searches, “flower bouquet” reigns supreme. But the next top searched spot goes to the surprising query, “beef jerky bouquet.”4. Plenty of people take to Search for Valentine’s Day getaway planning, with five pretty different cities racking up the most interest.",
            "5. The lead-up to Valentine’s Day isn’t all warm fuzzies, though. “When to break up” gets three times more searches than “when to propose.”6. And not all Valentine’s Day-related searches are focused on romantic relationships: “What to bring to a Galentine’s party” and “Galentine’s Instagram captions” both more than doubled in early February.7. Speaking of Galentine’s: Since the 2010 episode of “Parks and Recreation” introduced the idea of a pre-Valentine’s Day celebration devoted to female friendships, searches for the phrase have consistently appeared every February, peaking in February 2019.8. Breakout Galentine’s Day-related searches include “Galentine’s Day ideas,” “Galentine’s Day gifts” and “when is Galentine’s Day?” (according to the episode, it’s February 13).9. Some would say there’s no better recipient of Valentine’s Day pampering than yourself. If you need some inspiration, “red French tip nails” and “pink French tip nails” are the most-searched Valentine’s nail designs.10. Maybe the way to the heart really is through the stomach. “Heart-shaped pizza,” “heart-shaped cake” and “heart-shaped pasta” are the most searched foods modeled after this symbol of love. “Heart-shaped pizza” even spikes every February in the U.S.11. Not to be outdone, “heart-shaped taco platter near me” queries rose more than 300% in early February."

            "“How to read more books” became a breakout search term over the past five years, reaching an unforeseen spike in April 2022 and rising again with the new year. It's also a goal that might be surprisingly more complicated to pull off than it sounds. Between finding the time, choosing titles you'll actually want to finish and keeping track of your reads, it can be easy to get overwhelmed. But there are a bunch of Google tools that can help you hit the books now — and all year long. Here's how to read more books in 2023 and beyond with some help from Google.Read and browse with Google BooksGoogle Books is a vast resource that can help you in every step of your reading journey, from accessing free books, to reviewing the books you’ve already read to keeping track of the (ever-growing list of) titles you want to read. Here are some tips for how to get started:Browse Google Books’ 10 million free books. The online library is home to more than 10 million free books, and plenty more than you can pay to access.Preview books before buying. No buyer’s remorse, thanks. You can use the “preview” option on a book’s page in Google Books to get a sense of whether you’ll like a certain title or author before you buy the book.",
            "Use the “Similar books” tab for inspiration. On a book’s page, there is a list of tabs you can choose from, including one for similar books. If you really love a book you’ve read, looking at the “Similar books” tab can give you some suggestions for other books that you might also enjoy.And check out “Books for you” for other ideas. Cultivating your library helps Google Books make recommendations that are specific to your tastes and interests, which you can find in “Books for you” at the bottom of your library.Officially schedule time to read with Google CalendarIt can be hard to incorporate any new activity or hobby into your routine. One thing that might help: Use Google Calendar to make it an official part of your day. Set “meetings” with yourself specifically dedicated to reading — this way you might be more likely to actually do it, and less likely to cancel on yourself.",
            "Find your focus with digital wellbeing toolsReally losing yourself in a book often requires uninterrupted focus time — which can be tough to wrangle, especially with the lure of mobile phones and social media. Luckily, there are a few digital wellbeing tools available for Android and Pixel users that can help:Flip it and ignore it. Enable Flip to Shhh, an Android setting that lets you activate Do Not Disturb mode just by placing your phone face-down on a flat surface.Pause your apps. If you use your phone to read or listen to books, you can use Focus mode so that the only active apps are the ones you’re using to read. And if you’re reading from another device (or an actual printed book!), try pausing your most distracting apps and notifications.Use a timer if it helps. If you need an extra push, you can use your clock app to set a timer for uninterrupted reading time. Start with 10 minutes a day if you’re not sure how much time you can commit to a book. Then try 15, then 20 — whatever feels right.Limit your time on other apps. Another way to make more time for reading is to use Android’s digital wellbeing settings to limit how much time you’re spending on other potentially more distracting apps. Those settings allow you to choose how much time you’re willing to devote to any of those apps. Once you hit that number, you’ll know it’s time to read.",
            "Use Google Play to find audiobooksListening to audiobooks absolutely counts as reading them. If you think listening to audiobooks is a better fit for you or your lifestyle than reading books visually, here are some tips for how to make that a more regular habit in 2023:Choose from among Google Play’s millions of audiobook titles. There are tons of free titles, too, including some well-loved classics. A new auto-narration feature available to publishers means there are plenty of audiobooks to choose from.Grab the deal. Right now there’s a discount where you can get $3 off your first audiobook — if you need some extra motivation to get listening.",

            "Explore Google Books today, and you’ll find more than 40 million books in more than 500 languages. Through the Library Project, Google Books partners with libraries across the world to digitize physical books so they can be searched and accessed online. To do that, the books first need to be successfully transported to one of our scan centers. And sometimes, that journey is far from a simple trip.This story starts in April 2017, when the Google Books team began discussions with the National Library of Israel. “We strongly believe in making all of our collections as open and accessible as possible, and we believe that digitization — especially out-of-copyright works — is a great way to open access,” says Yaniv Levi Korem, Head of Technical Services at the National Library of Israel. “Plus, digitization helps reduce the need to use the physical books, keeping them safe from wear and tear.”It was determined that around 100,000 out-of-copyright books, about 45% of them in Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino, would be scanned and incorporated into the Google Books corpus.",
            "The problem? “Our usual methods for transporting books from the library to one of our scanning centers was not going to work,” says Fernanda Bispo, Google Books’ digitization operations manager. For other partnerships, the team relied mainly on ground transport: Carts specially designed for transporting books were loaded onto trucks that would drive from the library to one of our scanning centers.",
            "But transporting this treasure trove of books by land from Jerusalem was a complicated proposition, involving logistical challenges, complex international shipping regulations and numerous border crossings. From Israel, the trucks would need to take a ferry to Turkey, then drive more than 50 hours through Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria, before arriving in Germany.",
            "First by land, then by seaThe team considered air travel, but their transportation carts were about five inches too tall to fit in the standard air freight container. Plus, the cost would be about twice as expensive as ground shipping.With land and air out, they set their sights on the sea. They’d ship the books from Jerusalem via sea freight to Google’s point of entry for customs clearance in Rotterdam, then by ground to Germany — a trip that would take about two to three weeks one way. While this meant they could use their special carts and stay within budget, there were still a number of challenges to address.“When we scan a book, we transform the information within it, preserving it and making it searchable and shareable across the world,” Fernanda says. “But until we get those volumes into a scanning center, they’re incredibly fragile, vulnerable to shifts in temperature, humidity and handling. Some of these books were over 200 years old, and we needed to take great care in their transport.”Refrigerated sea freight containers, also known as “reefers,” would do the trick, allowing them to control the temperature and humidity of the books as they made their way over sea. Fernanda would receive a notification if the temperature within the reefer exceeded 21 degrees Celsius (69.8 degrees Fahrenheit) or a humidity level above 50%.“If the books were exposed to conditions outside of this range, they could develop mold, possibly rendering them unreadable, unscannable and unable to be reincorporated into the library’s collection,” she says. “Over the course of the project, I received a few of these notifications, but in each case, the reefer was able to correct itself and return temperatures to the appropriate range.”",
            "Testing, testingBut let’s go back a few chapters. There was, of course, no way the team would be loading their precious cargo without some testing. They had a reefer sent to the scan center in Germany to evaluate how the unloading process would compare to their other methods of transport.“The first issue that we had to solve was to ‘connect’ the reefer to our loading dock,” Fernanda says. “The floor of the reefer met the height of our loading dock, but it was offset by 90 degrees, meaning we could not simply back the trailer up to the dock and offload carts.”With each cart weighing around 288 kilograms, or 635 pounds, loading and unloading had to be done with care. So, they built a “pallet bridge,” consisting of two towers of pallets that bridged the gap between the container floor and loading dock, allowing them to pull the carts directly onto the dock.",
            "Once completed, they turned the page to the next hurdle: an uneven reefer floor. The wheels of the carts were getting stuck, requiring so much force to move that it put the cart’s contents in jeopardy.To solve this problem, they installed custom wooden flooring and added belts and bars to fix each cart into place. They also placed dunnage bags on the sides to keep the carts from touching the walls of the container, which, Fernanda says, “could lead to condensation and eventually — you guessed it — mold.”",
            "Once the team was certain they could safely ship the books via sea freight, they performed a full test run. It went off without a hitch, and regular shipments began three months later. Each cart can fit about 270 books, and each reefer fits 27 carts. After 10 round-trip shipments and two years of effort, the main part of this project was successfully completed. About 90,000 books were digitized during this phase.",
            "“The library expects to have smaller shipments of a few thousand books every few years, which could require us to revisit our shipping processes once again,” Fernanda says. “The journey of a book by sea could end up being just the beginning of our adventure.”"

These features, which were previously only available in the U.S., rolled out to eight new countries this year including the U.K., India, Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, France, Germany and Canada.",
            "4. Find authentic support for health-related issues.People grappling with a health condition often search for more than information — they’re also looking for support. When you search YouTube for health topics and questions related to certain conditions — like depression, anxiety or cancer — you’ll see relevant videos of personal stories.5. Use new device options to track and understand health metrics.This year we updated existing products and released new ones so you can track health data. For instance, you can see your breathing rate or heart rate right from your wrist with the Fitbit app. Check out the all-new Google Pixel Watch and latest Fitbit devices including the Sense 2, Versa 4 and Inspire to find your perfect fit.",
            "6. Monitor your heart health.You can check for signs of an irregular heart rhythm that may be AFib just by wearing your Fitbit tracker or smartwatch. Fitbit’s Irregular Heart Rhythm Notifications1 can help identify if your heart rhythm shows signs of this condition so that you can have a more informed conversation with your doctor.7. Improve your ZZZs.You can learn more about your sleep style and patterns with Fitbit’s new Sleep Profile. This Fitbit Premium feature makes your sleep data easy to interpret, so you can take steps to improve your sleep quality and, in turn, your overall health.",
            "8. Get more of your health data in one place.This year we brought Android users a better way to manage data across their favorite health and fitness apps — like MyFitnessPal, Oura and Peloton. Health Connect, currently available in beta, offers a single place to manage access to data across health and fitness apps. In the coming months, we'll continue to support developers to make this platform even better."

Of course, published in Victorian England (179 years ago this month), Scrooge’s road to redemption doesn’t involve a therapeutic chat with friends or a visit from Jolly Old St. Nick. Instead, come Christmas Eve, Scrooge gets a visit from his dead business partner, Jacob Marley, followed by three very punctual ghosts who whisk him away to revisit all the low points in his life, before showing him a tombstone with his name carved on it. After a night like that, Scrooge finds his holiday spirit — and fast.",

            "If you’re looking for ways to make more sustainability choices, here are five updates from the past year you don’t want to miss. Whether it’s deciding which driving route to take home from work, what new car to buy or where to stay for your next vacation, all of these choices can add up over time to positively impact you and the planet. In fact, a recent report from IPCC offers insight into the impact small changes to people’s daily routines can have on global emissions.Take a look at updates from 2022 across Search, Maps, Pixel, Google travel and more that make the sustainable choice the easiest choice. Plus, these updates help save time, money and energy!",
            "1. Choose the most fuel-efficient drive with eco-friendly routing in MapsThis year we expanded eco-friendly routing from the U.S.,to Canada and Europe, letting drivers in more places see and choose the most fuel-efficient route. With just a few taps, you can see the relative fuel savings and time difference between two routes and choose the one that works best for you. To make the estimates even more accurate, you can update your engine type — and even note if you drive an electric vehicle — in Settings. Simply open the Google Maps app, go to Settings, then Navigation Settings, scroll to Route Options, then choose your engine type. Already this feature has helped avoid an estimate of more than half a million metric tons of carbon emissions — that’s equivalent to taking approximately 100,000 fuel-based cars off the road.",
            "2. Find flights with lower emissions on Google FlightsThis year we made it easier to book lower-emission flights without thinking twice. Since 2021, you’ve been able to view estimated carbon emissions for flights on Google Flights. Our latest search filter lets you view only flights that have lower emissions compared to the average for similar trips. Simply tap the “Less emissions only” filter on Google Flights, and the other options are out of sight and out of mind.",
            "3. Browse sustainable hotel options with the ‘eco-certified’ filterIt works the same way when you search for hotels on google.com/travel. Select the “Eco-certified” filter that we rolled out this year, and you can browse a list that only contains eco-certified properties. Check out the ‘About’ tab for an individual hotel to see more details about their eco-friendly practices, like waste reduction or sustainable sourcing.",
            "4. Repair your Pixel phone with these easy optionsIt’s easier to repair, return or recycle your phone so you can be comfortable knowing it won’t end up in a landfill. This year we made spare parts available for purchase at ifixit.com for Pixel 2 through Pixel 7 Pro and future Pixel models in the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia and EU countries where Pixel is available. If you’re ready to part ways with your Pixel phone, there are two options that let you rest easy that your old phone is responsibly reused or recycled. Our trade-in program in select countries lets you send in any eligible phone from a variety of brands to earn credit rewards for a new Pixel. And with our recycling program you can mail in your old or unused devices and we’ll responsibly recycle them for you.",
            "5. Shopping for a new car? See emissions and fuel costs estimates in SearchIf you or someone you know is in the market for a new car, there are a number of new features to help you make an informed decision. You can now see the annual fuel cost for cars in your search results. Still can’t decide based on fuel costs? Google will also show emissions estimates for cars so you can get a better understanding of how a particular car model compares to similar ones. With this information, narrowing down your top choices is a little easier. And if your final choice is an electric vehicle, in the U.S. you can now see helpful information about EV rebates from the Inflation Reduction Act in Search results to save even more money.",
            "We’ll keep working to make sure our products and technologies help you make choices that benefit both you and the planet. Because when it comes to the collective impact of our individual decisions, we’re optimistic that together we can make a difference. After all, taking meaningful action against climate change requires everyone’s participation — from corporations and governments to individuals."

On that very seasonal note, we took a look at different coziness-related U.S. searches and how they’ve performed over time.Let’s start with the basics: U.S. search interest in coziness appears to have steadily increased over time. Since 2004, searches for “cozy” have dependably ticked upward each winter.",

Enter Hygge — a Danish and Norwegian word for the feeling of being cozy and content. Searches for Hygge exploded in January 2017 — even though the term itself has been around for far longer. In fact, if you take a look at ngrams (which shows how words and phrases appear in our database of books), you’ll see it started showing up in published materials in the 1960s.",

            "6. And speaking of the aesthetics of hygge and coziness, there are few things comfier than a soft, chunky sweater. Coincidentally, searches for “sweater weather” peaked in December 2013, which just so happens to be the year that the song “Sweater Weather” was released.",

            "For 18 years, the Google Books Library Project has digitized and cataloged books to help users around the globe discover them and the information they contain. When a volume is digitized, the book and its contents become more accessible and useful to the world. Even one decades-old story can act as a puzzle piece, with the potential to unlock connections and solve previously insurmountable problems.Perhaps nothing has highlighted the vital nature of this work like the COVID-19 pandemic. In early 2020, many scientists believed that particles containing COVID-19 were too large to be airborne. Medical canon held that only particles sized 5 microns or smaller could stay in the air long enough to be transmitted between people over 6 feet apart. But a team of scientists questioned the 5 micron figure. Katie Randall, then a graduate student at Virginia Tech, went to work investigating the origin of the number. “I was working on my dissertation when the pandemic hit, and I had to pause in-person research,” says Katie. “I was supposed to focus on revising my research plan, but when I got the email about this project, I knew I couldn’t say no — it was too important and too intriguing to ignore.”In her research, Katie located an out-of-print book, Airborne Contagion and Air Hygiene: An Ecological Study of Droplet Infections, written by William Firth Wells in 1955. While she normally would have borrowed the book through an agreement between libraries to share items in their collection, pandemic closures meant that was not an option. Fortunately, she was able to locate a digital copy of the book in HathiTrust, a Google Books partner.HathiTrust is a nonprofit collaborative of academic and research libraries which preserves digitized items — most of which come from partnerships with Google Books. “Early on, our partner libraries dedicated themselves to digital preservation,” says Mike Furlough, Executive Director of HathiTrust. “But even when preservation was the goal, our thoughts were always on providing access for research and scholarship.”With the help of the digitized book, Katie discovered that the 5 micron threshold had no real scientific basis — in fact, the experiments detailed in Wells’ book showed the aerosolization of particles as big as 100 microns. Further research showed that Alexander Langmuir, then head of the newly formed CDC, had publicly dismissed Wells’ findings. Langmuir insisted that particles larger than 5 microns would simply fall from the air onto surfaces, and the 5 micron number stuck. While Langmuir eventually recognized the scientific validity of Wells’ findings and even, in remarks he made in 1980, acknowledged that neither he nor the medical field was prepared to accept the idea of airborne transmission at the time, his admission did nothing to erase the 5 micron figure, which continued to be repeated and cemented as medical canon.Katie’s discovery allowed the research team to provide concrete evidence that COVID-19 could be transmitted through the air. “One goal of our research was to shift the needle on public health messaging regarding COVID-19,” says Katie. “Ventilation and high quality masks are an important defense against COVID, but also against other airborne diseases.”Following Katie Randall’s discovery, the Google Books Library Project began a months-long process to find the copyright holder for Wells’ book, in order to get permission to open access to the digital copy to everyone. The search involved publishers, copyright lawyers and genealogical research to locate the living descendants of William Firth Wells. One of them, Martha “Alex” Kahlson, put the Books team in touch with the rest of her family, and it was Martha “Molly” McIntosh, Wells’ grandniece, who enthusiastically granted permission to open the book for full viewing at books.google.com.This is just one example of information locked away in an out of print book and all but forgotten, waiting to be unlocked through digitization. Google, HathiTrust, and our library partners continue to work to ensure that quality information will always have a place in libraries — both physical and digital — and accessible to curious minds across the globe."

In fact, search interest in “cost of living” has reached a 10-year high this year in the U.S. For people looking for information about financial assistance, help is often a search away.We have updated our search experience to make it easier for people seeking support online to find answers to commonly asked questions about federal government benefits and find food support for their families.",
            "Learn about some helpful benefits",
            "Among the top financial assistance related questions searched in the U.S., people are asking, “how to get financial assistance,” “financial assistance for medical bills” and “what is financial assistance for disability.” It can be complicated to understand the benefits that may be available for you.That’s why we have updated our search experience to make it easier to find everything you need to know about programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). With a quick Google search, you can find at-a-glance information on eligibility criteria, how to apply, locally relevant contact information and easy access to login portals once you have enrolled. This information is also available if you’re looking for benefits like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Income (SSDI).",
            "Once you know what services you’d like to apply for, local government sites are often the next step. Google.org, our philanthropic arm, is providing pro bono teams of Google.org Fellows — including Google user experience designers, engineers and product managers — to help make these websites more accessible and easy to use in cities and states across the country.With support from the Fellows, the City of Seattle built CiviForm, an open-source web application that streamlines access to public assistance by making it easier and quicker for people to apply to multiple programs in one place. Since the City of Seattle launched CiviForm last year, application times for those seeking support dropped 90%, from an average of 33 minutes to just three. Google.org Fellows have already helped the city of Bloomington, Indiana launch the tool for their residents, and we will work with more communities in 2023.",
            "Fight food insecurity",
            "Every year around the holidays, Google sees a spike in searches for food support and in 2022, we saw a 20% increase in searches for “food bank and pantries” from 2021. Federal programs like the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP) feed more than 42 million Americans each year. When you search for “snap benefits,” you can find locally relevant, direct resources to help determine your eligibility and how to apply for the benefit. Once approved for the SNAP program, many people use Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards to pay for food. You can now search for “EBT” to find information about your state’s program, including how to log in, check your balance and find the right telephone numbers for support. With our latest updates, you can also find easily accessible information about the Special Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).We also know local food banks and pantries play a vital role in feeding those in need in our communities. Last year, 53 million people in the U.S. turned to food banks and pantries to put meals on their table. In November, Google.org announced a new partnership with Feeding America, the country’s largest charitable food system, to help deliver 50 million meals to families across the U.S. You can find more information on Google products that are providing support at findfoodsupport.withgoogle.com.Connecting people with high quality information is critical to the work we do at Google. We're committed to empowering everyone with the knowledge to build a better life for themselves, and more resilient communities."

            "“It’s hard to pick your favorite kid,” Anurag Acharya says when I ask him to talk about a favorite Google Scholar feature he’s worked on. “I work on product, engineering, operations, partnerships,” he says. He’s been doing it for 18 years, which as of this month, happens to be how long Google Scholar has been around.Google Scholar is also one of Google’s longest-running services. The comprehensive database of research papers, legal cases and other scholarly publications was the fourth Search service Google launched, Anurag says. In honor of this very important tool’s 18th anniversary, I asked Anurag to share 18 things you can do in Google Scholar that you might have missed.1. Copy article citations in the style of your choice.With a simple click of the cite button (which sits below an article entry), Google Scholar will give you a ready-to-use citation for the article in five styles, including APA, MLA and Chicago. You can select and copy the one you prefer.2. Dig deeper with related searches.Google Scholar’s related searches can help you pinpoint your research; you’ll see them show up on a page in between article results. Anurag describes it like this: You start with a big topic — like “cancer” — and follow up with a related search like “lung cancer” or “colon cancer” to explore specific kinds of cancer.",
            "3. And don’t miss the related articles.This is another great way to find more papers similar to one you found helpful — you can find this link right below an entry.4. Read the papers you find.Scholarly articles have long been available only by subscription. To keep you from having to log in every time you see a paper you’re interested in, Scholar works with libraries and publishers worldwide to integrate their subscriptions directly into its search results. Look for a link marked [PDF] or [HTML]. This also includes preprints and other free-to-read versions of papers.5. Access Google Scholar tools from anywhere on the web with the Scholar Button browser extension.The Scholar Button browser extension is sort of like a mini version of Scholar that can move around the web with you. If you’re searching for something, hitting the extension icon will show you studies about that topic, and if you’re reading a study, you can hit that same button to find a version you read, create a citation or to save it to your Scholar library.",
            "6. Learn more about authors through Scholar profiles.There are many times when you’ll want to know more about the researchers behind the ideas you’re looking into. You can do this by clicking on an author’s name when it’s hyperlinked in a search result. You’ll find all of their work as well as co-authors, articles they’re cited in and so on. You can also follow authors from their Scholar profile to get email updates about their work, or about when and where their work is cited.7. Easily find topic experts.One last thing about author profiles: If there are topics listed below an author’s name on their profile, you can click on these areas of expertise and you’ll see a page of more authors who are researching and publishing on these topics, too.8. Search for court opinions with the “Case law” button.Scholar is the largest free database of U.S. court opinions. When you search for something using Google Scholar, you can select the “Case law” button below the search box to see legal cases your keywords are referenced in. You can read the opinions and a summary of what they established.9. See how those court opinions have been cited.If you want to better understand the impact of a particular piece of case law, you can select “How Cited,” which is below an entry, to see how and where the document has been cited. For example, here is the How Cited page for Marbury v. Madison, a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that established that courts can strike down unconstitutional laws or statutes.10. Understand how a legal opinion depends on another.When you’re looking at how case laws are cited within Google Scholar, click on “Cited by” and check out the horizontal bars next to the different results. They indicate how relevant the cited opinion is in the court decision it’s cited within. You will see zero, one, two or three bars before each result. Those bars indicate the extent to which the new opinion depends on and refers to the cited case.",
            "11. Sign up for Google Scholar alerts.Want to stay up to date on a specific topic? Create an alert for a Google Scholar search for your topics and you’ll get email updates similar to Google Search alerts. Another way to keep up with research in your area is to follow new articles by leading researchers. Go to their profiles and click “Follow.” If you’re a junior grad student, you may consider following articles related to your advisor’s research topics, for instance.12. Save interesting articles to your library.It’s easy to go down fascinating rabbit hole after rabbit hole in Google Scholar. Don’t lose track of your research and use the save option that pops up under search results so articles will be in your library for later reading.13. Keep your library organized with labels.Labels aren’t only for Gmail! You can create labels within your Google Scholar library so you can keep your research organized. Click on “My library,” and then the “Manage labels…” option to create a new label.14. If you’re a researcher, share your research with all your colleagues.Many research funding agencies around the world now mandate that funded articles should become publicly free to read within a year of publication — or sooner. Scholar profiles list such articles to help researchers keep track of them and open up access to ones that are still locked down. That means you can immediately see what is currently available from researchers you’re interested in and how many of their papers will soon be publicly free to read.15. Look through Scholar’s annual top publications and papers.Every year, Google Scholar releases the top publications based on the most-cited papers. That list (available in 11 languages) will also take you to each publication’s top papers — this takes into account the “h index,” which measures how much impact an article has had. It’s an excellent place to start a research journey as well as get an idea about the ideas and discoveries researchers are currently focused on.16.

            "For the past 22 years, Year in Search has provided a unique look into what we all cared about, what inspired us and intrigued us, all over the world. This year was no different.2022 was defined by our collective search for change and new possibilities. After two years of uncertainty we re-emerged stronger, empowered and sought out ways to become better versions of ourselves. We challenged ourselves and asked personal questions like, “can i change?”Global search interest in “how to change myself” and “how to be better” reached an all-time high this year. Trending searches ranged from changing jobs to ways to improve ourselves and our relationships. For the first time in Google Trends history, the world searched for “happiest jobs” more than “happiest cities.” And people searched “how to be more present” and “how to be a better friend” more than ever. We sought changes big and small: more than ever before we searched for tips on how to speak up more, and we also looked for tips on evolving our personal style.But in the midst of this personal growth we faced global conflict and natural disasters that tested our resolve. In these moments we came together as a global community and looked for ways to support each other by searching for “how to help Ukraine'' or “how to help Puerto Rico.” Seeing the strength and determination that we had in these moments inspired us to ask questions like “how to be fearless” and “can i create change.”As the year comes to a close, take a moment to look back, reflect and celebrate all the moments this year that challenged, inspired and enabled us to grow. To watch the film and see all the trends that defined 2022, check out our Year in Search website."

            "Every year, we look back at the moments, people and trends that sparked our collective curiosity through Year in Search. Around the world, people sought to learn more about everything from complex global issues, to ways to help each other — not to mention the latest pop culture news.“Wordle” was the top trending search globally, as guessing five-letter words every day became a way of life. On Assistant, one of the top asks on mobile this year was to “tell me a fun fact.” We saw pop culture continue to leave its mark as we searched for “how to become a fighter pilot” thanks to “Top Gun: Maverick,” and how to learn new languages, specifically Minion, High Valyrian and Klingon. Most of us also couldn’t seem to get songs from hit TV shows out of our head, with Ali Sethi’s \"Pasoori\" becoming the top global Hum to Search song.While Year in Search reveals a lot about what we all have in common, every community showed they were unique, too. This year we are launching a local hub that showcases interesting trends from all over the U.S. For example, the Anchorage, Alaska and Des Moines, Iowa areas were the only two places in the U.S. that had “quilt shops\" in their top trending \"near me\" searches. And while those areas looked to stay cozy in a warm blanket, other areas like Parkersburg, West Virginia had “dog parks” as their top trending \"near me\" search. And even though searches for “negroni sbagliato” reached a global all-time high worldwide, only two areas in the U.S, Grand Junction, Colorado and Shreveport, Louisiana, had “negroni” as their top trending recipes.",
            "The way we search is also evolving beyond just typing into a search box. People are finding what they need in more natural ways, like humming a song, snapping a picture with Lens or by asking Assistant, “Hey Google” when they want to learn more. People most commonly used Lens, for example, to translate an image and shop a look. \"Price,\" \"vintage\" and \"near me\" were among the top text searches in multisearch along with “what is this” or “how to fix.” Lens also helped people better explore the world around them — by identifying what they saw. In fact, the top searched animals on Lens this year were the domestic short-haired cat, tabby cat and polydactyl cat. And around the world, Assistant was helping people make things a little bit easier for everyday life. From setting 7am alarm clocks — the most popular alarm time people asked to set — to making you laugh with “tell me a joke” being a top ask followed by “one more.”Curious to learn more about what the world was searching for this year?

So today, we’re making it even easier to dive deeper and explore topics that are related to a search.Topics help you exploreYou’re probably familiar with how you can use filters to see just videos, news, images or shopping results on Google Search. We'll now show an easy-to-scroll list of related topics alongside these filters at the top of the search results page to help you drill down or discover something new about a specific topic. You can add or remove topics, which are designated by a + symbol, to quickly zoom in or backtrack on a search.For example, if you’re searching for “dinner ideas,” you might see topics like “healthy” or “easy.” Tapping on a topic adds it to your query, helping you quickly refine your search results with less typing. Topics are dynamic and will change as you tap, giving you more options and helping you explore new areas. For example, if you tapped on “healthy,” you might see “vegetarian” or “quick” appear next.",

            "Editor's note: Updated Tuesday, December 6, 2022Europe is gearing up for a challenging winter - with rising prices and pressures on the European grid, driven by Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, further driving the need for secure, reliable, sustainable and affordable energy sources.We know that energy security and affordability are top of mind for many across Europe right now. People are turning to Google to ask questions about conserving energy and managing their costs. In the UK, a year ago just one in ten searches on the topic of energy prices was a ‘why’, ‘how’ or ‘when’ question - now it’s one in four. In Germany, we’ve seen search interest trending for queries like ‘how to save natural gas’, ‘heating cost’ and how to save energy - while in Belgium, searches for ‘how to save on gas’ are up more than 5,000% since this time last year.In times of uncertainty, people turn to Google for help and information. As people look for new ways to stay on top of their energy consumption and keep costs manageable, we’re launching a new feature in 29 countries and 22 languages across Europe to enable people to find relevant and actionable information to help them navigate this crisis and save energy.",
            "Relevant information on Google SearchStarting today, when people search for information on the energy landscape in Europe, they'll see dedicated features with helpful and reliable information. When you search for things like ‘Europe energy crisis’ and ‘energy price’, you'll see news articles, local information including financial assistance that may be available, and recommended actions from the International Energy Agency to help conserve energy.",
            "Whether it’s turning down the heat or adjusting the settings of your boiler, you will be able to see, at a glance, information about saving energy in your home. These information panels will surface alongside other relevant results from the open web.The launch of the energy crisis feature is a further addition to products and tools we have already launched in Europe to help people learn more about accessing energy affordably, reliably, and efficiently. For example, earlier this year we launched updates to Google Maps that help you find more fuel-efficient routes to reduce emissions and costs when you need to drive.Efficient energy useWe also know that change starts at home. That’s why, over the past five years, we’ve worked to increase the energy efficiency of our computing systems by five times. And Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy compared to an average data center. As part of our goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, we operated at 66% carbon-free energy in 2021 – up 5% from 2019 – and have been matching 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with renewable energy purchases for five consecutive years.Because of the challenges Europe is facing, we’re now taking additional steps that will enable us to temporarily further reduce our overall power usage in the region to ease demand during the winter months. We’re implementing various measures like restructuring workloads to ease the pressure on the European grid without compromising performance for our users and customers, and with increased supervision by our site reliability engineers.In addition, to further reduce energy usage in our offices across the region, we are continuously auditing and adjusting demand-based heating, cooling, ventilating and other systems to switch off and reduce usage whenever possible. Combined, our energy efficiency measures in our offices and operations are helping support the European grid at this time of energy scarcity.Technology can contribute to addressing the challenges facing Europe today. We remain committed to connecting people with timely, relevant and actionable information when they need it most and to supporting the communities in which we live and work during both good and challenging times."

Here are 10 moments of PSL search trend history.“Pumpkin Spice Latte” began gaining popularity as a search term in the fall of 2010.",
            "2. It started out as a solidly autumnal treat — up until 2017, search interest in “Pumpkin Spice Latte” first peaked in September, and then again in October and November.",
            "3. These days, it’s becoming more of a late-summer, early-fall beverage: Since 2018, search interest in “Pumpkin Spice Latte” has peaked in August.",
            "4. On that note: Searches for “Pumpkin Spice Latte” were highest in 2022 during the week of August 28 - September 3.",
            "5. Search interest in “pumpkin spice latte” hit new heights in August of this year.",
            "6. …Which isn’t terribly surprising, given that it’s been on a steady increase every year — until 2018! Search interest dropped significantly in 2018, and only began rising again in 2021.7. Speaking of PSLs, search interest in the pumpkin spice acronym grew annually alongside the full drink name. (Quick note that not all “PSL” searches are about the drink — PSL is also an acronym for other things, like Port St. Lucie, a city in Florida. But PSL spikes do seem to coincide with “pumpkin spice latte” spikes each fall, so clearly some of the interest overlaps.)",
            "8. Looking at related search terms, searches for “pumpkin spice” have actually always been higher than search interest for “pumpkin spice latte.” But they’ve also experienced a rise in popularity parallel to search interest in the coffee drink.",
            "This begs the question: Is it the chicken or the egg? Or rather, the pumpkin spice or the latte? Has a penchant for pumpkin spice driven interest in the drink, or is it the other way around?9. Search interest in “pumpkin spice” (hold the latte) is also happening earlier each year. Initially the spike happened in November and then October…but that peak moved to September and has stayed there since 2014.",
            "10. And finally: Not all pumpkin spice products are edible. Earlier this month in the U.S., the most-searched “pumpkin spice scented” items (in order of popularity) were cat litter, soap, pouches, candles and hand lotion."

We’ve heard from you that you want to see more of this content in Search, so we’ve been exploring new ways to make it easier to find. Starting today, a new feature will appear when you search for something that might benefit from the diverse personal experiences found in online discussions.The new feature, labeled “Discussions and forums,” will include helpful content from a variety of popular forums and online discussions across the web. For example, if you search for the best cars for a growing family, in addition to other web results, you’ll now see links to forum posts that include relevant advice from people, like their experience with minivans for transporting multiple children.Today it will be rolling out for English users on mobile in the U.S. As with all Search features, we’ll continue to learn about whether people are finding this new feature valuable over time, and may update it in the future as we learn what’s most useful for people.",

            "For over two decades, we've dedicated ourselves to our mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. We started with text search, but over time, we've continued to create more natural and intuitive ways to find information — you can now search what you see with your camera, or ask a question aloud with your voice.At Search On today, we showed how advancements in artificial intelligence are enabling us to transform our information products yet again. We're going far beyond the search box to create search experiences that work more like our minds, and that are as multidimensional as we are as people.We envision a world in which you’ll be able to find exactly what you’re looking for by combining images, sounds, text and speech, just like people do naturally. You’ll be able to ask questions, with fewer words — or even none at all — and we’ll still understand exactly what you mean. And you’ll be able to explore information organized in a way that makes sense to you.We call this making search more natural and intuitive, and we’re on a long-term path to bring this vision to life for people everywhere. To give you an idea of how we’re evolving the future of our information products, here are three highlights from what we showed today at Search On.",
            "Making visual search work more naturallyCameras have been around for hundreds of years, and they’re usually thought of as a way to preserve memories, or these days, create content. But a camera is also a powerful way to access information and understand the world around you — so much so that your camera is your next keyboard. That’s why in 2017 we introduced Lens, so you can search what you see using your camera or an image. Now, the age of visual search is here — in fact, people use Lens to answer 8 billion questions every month.We’re making visual search even more natural with multisearch, a completely new way to search using images and text simultaneously, similar to how you might point at something and ask a friend a question about it. We introduced multisearch earlier this year as a beta in the U.S., and at Search On, we announced we’re expanding it to more than 70 languages in the coming months. We’re taking this capability even further with “multisearch near me,” enabling you to take a picture of an unfamiliar item, such as a dish or plant, then find it at a local place nearby, like a restaurant or gardening shop. We will start rolling “multisearch near me” out in English in the U.S. this fall.",
            "Translating the world around youOne of the most powerful aspects of visual understanding is its ability to break down language barriers. With advancements in AI, we’ve gone beyond translating text to translating pictures. People already use Google to translate text in images over 1 billion times a month, across more than 100 languages — so they can instantly read storefronts, menus, signs and more.But often, it’s the combination of words plus context, like background images, that bring meaning. We’re now able to blend translated text into the background image thanks to a machine learning technology called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). So if you point your camera at a magazine in another language, for example, you’ll now see translated text realistically overlaid onto the pictures underneath.",
            "Exploring the world with immersive viewOur quest to create more natural and intuitive experiences also extends to helping you explore the real world. Thanks to advancements in computer vision and predictive models, we're completely reimagining what a map can be. This means you’ll see our 2D map evolve into a multi-dimensional view of the real world, one that allows you to experience a place as if you are there.Just as live traffic in navigation made Google Maps dramatically more helpful, we’re making another significant advancement in mapping by bringing helpful insights — like weather and how busy a place is — to life with immersive view in Google Maps. With this new experience, you can get a feel for a place before you even step foot inside, so you can confidently decide when and where to go.Say you’re interested in meeting a friend at a restaurant. You can zoom into the neighborhood and restaurant to get a feel for what it might be like at the date and time you plan to meet up, visualizing things like the weather and learning how busy it might be. By fusing our advanced imagery of the world with our predictive models, we can give you a feel for what a place will be like tomorrow, next week, or even next month. We’re expanding the first iteration of this with aerial views of 250 landmarks today, and immersive view will come to five major cities in the coming months, with more on the way.",
            "These announcements, along with many others introduced at Search On, are just the start of how we’re transforming our products to help you go beyond the traditional search box. We’re steadfast in our pursuit to create technology that adapts to you and your life — to help you make sense of information in ways that are most natural to you."

Either way, it adds up to hours of discussion and work each week, all dedicated to making Doodle magic happen.“We want to create that feeling of surprise and delight when you’re going about your day-to-day life, and then — tada! — a little gift,” Jessica says. “We want people to learn something, or laugh, or feel inspired.”As the team lead, part of Jessica's job during this annual selection is to help choose Doodles from a massive pile of submissions (which come from Doodle team members, other Googlers and then from people completely outside Google), discuss them with this committee and a network of global cultural consultants and then decide on the best way to bring them to life. \"You have to figure out how you want to depict this topic or person,” she says. “Should it be an image or an animated GIF? Or should it be interactive, or even a game.”Perla Campos, Marketing lead for Doodles, says this process takes so long partly because getting the most diverse and inclusive collection of Doodles requires the team to hear from Googlers all over the world. “It’s a balance of having a lot of cooks in the kitchen but also making sure we have everyone involved,” she says. The other reason selections are so drawn out: Perla estimates that the team looks over “a couple thousand” Doodle ideas. “It’s a puzzle,” she says. “It’s a huge puzzle.”While Doodles are beloved inside Google and by many who visit the homepage, more goes into them than you might think. So I asked a few Googlers on the Doodles team to share some of the surprising and, yes, delightful details and stories from behind the scenes.1. The Doodle team receives about 7,000 submissions a year.Jessica says the hardest part of the team’s job is definitely sifting through Doodle submissions — because there are so many great ones. The team gets hundreds of requests every day from people who email doodleproposals@google.com, and Googlers are pitching their concepts all the time, too.",
            "One really important part of this submission process is working with Local Doodle Managers who represent different global countries and clue the core team into what important moments and milestones will resonate the most on a local level. Not all Doodles display everywhere; some are specific to their regions, and these country-specific teammates help manage these requests. “We literally couldn’t do it without submissions and then help from our Local Doodle Managers,” Perla says.2. We published our 5,000th Doodle in 2020.It celebrated Slovakia’s Freedom and Democracy Day, the country’s annual holiday commemorating heroic efforts by local youth activists. In contrast, the very first Doodle was published way back in 1998, and was a bit of a joke from Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to remind Googlers they would be out of office for Burning Man.",
            "3. We have a public archive where you can check out every Doodle ever made.It launched in December 2011 (and keep an eye out, because it’s getting a makeover in the near future). In the archive, you can read about each Doodle and learn about the topic at hand, and often read about the artist as well — there’s also a section for interactive Doodles you can revisit. You can even check out the history of Doodles for any specific day. (And since we’re talking about learning more about Doodles: Did you know you can click each Doodle for more information about its theme? Just a little pro tip.)",
            "4. The Doodles team has a set of principles that every single Doodle follows.A major one is that Doodles should aim to delight and surprise people, as Jessica mentioned above. Another key principle: Doodles are never dedicated to someone who’s still alive, because person-focused Doodles are meant to honor someone’s lifetime achievements. Perla says Stephen Hawking is a good example of why the team has this principle. “We were able to create this really cool video Doodle in partnership with his family to honor him. We were able to give him a proper tribute.”",
            "Doodles also never promote brands. “This is a gift to our audience. We don’t want it to feel like an ad,” Jessica explains. The team also strives to showcase high-quality art and technology, and aims to select or create Doodles that are inclusive of everyone.5. The first animated Doodle premiered on Halloween 2000.It was the work of guest artist Lorie Loeb. Halloween Doodles would go on to become an annual focus for animation and engineering feats (more on that later!).",
            "6. Doodles aren’t all entirely digital.While plenty of artists use digital mediums to create Doodles, others start with sketches or paintings — or even other items — to create their Doodles. One example was a Veteran’s Day Doodle made by a Veteran who’s also an artist. “She took old military uniforms from all different branches and made a paper scroll of them all together,” Jessica says. “It’s an amazing piece of art.”",
            "7. Many Doodles are the work of multiple teams at Google.For instance, the first AI-powered Doodle honoring Johann Sebastian Bach that came out in 2019 was the work of the engineering Doodle team and Google’s machine learning department. “It was such a great synthesis of an interesting idea plus this technology that we were working on at Google,” says lead Doodle engineer Tom Tabanao. “It was a cool way to make that technology accessible to people.”",
            "8. The Halloween 2018 Doodle actually came out of a Googler hackathon.The 2018 Halloween Doodle was a multiplayer game that Tom wanted to make. “I thought it was an impossible goal but we made a demo and we saw how fun it was,” he says. “So we started building it out and testing it more, and then we held a hackathon for a week to work on it. By the end of the week, people were playing this really simple game for hours.” So they set to work on the Doodle, which became a major engineering feat that took literal years to make.",
            "And speaking of Doodles that took a long time to make…9. The Selena homage, which launched in October 2017, underwent a major makeover.Perla actually pitched the idea for a Selena Doodle when she was working as Spain’s Local Doodle Manager. “Obviously, huge bias on my end! I had a personal stake in that one,” she says. “When I heard it was picked for the next year I was like, ‘That’s great,’ but also, ‘I’m so jealous I won’t work on it!’” Fast forward a few months, when she ended up taking a role on the central Doodle team, where she'd work directly on the Selena Doodle.",
            "Upon learning the intention of the team to create a static illustration honoring the entertainer, she asked if the team could rethink things. “I asked, 'can we hold it so that we can try and license music and work with the family? I really think we should do something amazing here.'” They scrapped the original proposal and decided to go bigger — much, much bigger, with music and video, and eventually a massive audience; it ended up becoming one of the most popular video Doodles ever.To honor Selena and talk about the Doodle, her sister, Suzette, even visited Google to discuss how her family collaborated with the Doodle team on the project.",
            "10. The series of Champion Island game Doodles from 2021 had the longest production process.The Doodle — er, Doodles — launched as a series starting in July 2021 to celebrate the Olympics. It was originally supposed to debut the previous summer. But because COVID-19 delayed the entire Olympic games, the interactive game was also pushed back…a whole year.",
            "With six sport mini games, 24 side quests, multiple endings and over three hours of gameplay, it's the most expansive Doodle ever made. It even contains easter eggs for other Doodle games, like Magic Cat Academy and Pangolin Love.11. In 2009, we created the first same-day Doodle when water was discovered on the moon.Artist Jennifer Hom worked for just a few hours and then it went live. “I was sitting at my desk at 9 a.m. PT, when I stumbled on an article about this current event,” she wrote in the Doodle archive.",
            "“I quickly sent the article to my team and, by the time I was about to take a bite out of my lunch, I received a call to have this Doodle sketched, drafted, finished and live on all our homepages in four hours. It was an exciting day for a Doodler and the world of science!”Sometimes the team has the luxury of taking weeks or even a year to produce a Doodle. For the really quick turnaround ones, though, a small dedicated team of Doodlers keeps an eye out for events that might be a fit. (Or sometimes another Doodler stumbles on one of these concepts, like Jennifer did!). Then they have to make sure the idea has the green light from everyone from marketing to policy and beyond…and, oh, is there an artist or animator within the Doodle team who can turn this around in time? “Everyone’s sort of on standby while this is happening,” Perla says. Once the Doodle’s almost ready, they ask what regions want to opt into displaying it and then…well, they upload it.12. The team often turns to cultural consultants for feedback.“If a Doodle is about or for a community, we bring that community into the process,” Perla says. This includes hiring guest artists, but also working with people beyond that to get the work right and truly represent a group accurately. “For example, we ran a Doodle during Native American Heritage Month last year honoring a Zuni artist, and we partnered with a guest artist from the tribe but also a Zuni community cultural consultant the tribal government connected us with.”",
            "The Doodle team was able to run things by the consultant to make sure they felt it rang true. “It’s important we be real with ourselves and say, ‘We don’t know about this topic — but let’s find people who do, so it’s authentic.’” After all, Perla says, the goal of Doodles is to make sure everyone, everywhere feels represented and valued."

            "As a physician and an academic, I’ve worked with communities that have historically experienced health inequalities due to factors like where they live, what their income is and how they identify. And I’ve seen firsthand how technology can connect individuals to critical information and tools that help them manage their health and help health care providers expand access to care for them.Today, I lead a team at Google focused on making sure our research, products and technologies can help billions of people live healthier lives — especially the communities that have historically been underserved by healthcare.This week, we’re hosting our annual Google Health Equity Summit. This event brings together researchers, policymakers, health equity experts and more from both inside and outside of Google to discuss pressing health equity issues. We’ll also share updates on how we’re helping billions of people be healthier. Here are a few highlights:",
            "Connecting people to care that’s right for themInformation is a determinant of health, and bridging information gaps can help foster more equitable care. People from all over the world use Google products and services to find information about their health needs and questions. We work to make sure everyone can access authoritative information that is relevant and actionable based on those needs.Search features help people easily access care that’s right for them — from showing appointment availability to finding in-network care options. We’ve updated our search experience to make it easier to navigate U.S. government benefits programs, like Medicaid which covers one in four people including about half of all children in the U.S.",
            "In the coming weeks, when you search for Medicare and Medicaid plans, you’ll see additional information about eligibility requirements and the enrollment process. For those enrolled in Medicaid, you’ll also be able to filter nearby healthcare providers that accept Medicaid, alongside an existing filter for Medicare — making it easier to find doctors who accept your plan.",
            "People also turn to YouTube looking for answers to their health questions and to find online communities where they can connect about shared health issues and needs. To boost the quality of information and access to authoritative health content, we’ve launched product features and established partnerships over the past few years.Today, YouTube is rolling out THE-IQ – Tackling Health Equity through Information Quality, a program in partnership with Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) that brings together organizations supporting underrepresented and under-resourced communities. YouTube and KFF will provide resources, such as seed funding and video production expertise, to The Loveland Foundation, the National Birth Equity Collaborative and the Health Equity Leadership & Exchange Network at the Satcher Health Leadership Institute to help them reach more people on YouTube around important topics like mental health, maternal care and health access.",
            "Extending resources and technologies to support community workIn addition to building health equity within our products, we have an equally important role to support work happening in the broader health community.Last year, we debuted the Fitbit Health Equity Research Initiative to offer Fitbit and Fitabase resources and technologies to researchers studying the impact of health disparities and possible solutions. Awardees included those working on Black maternal, fetal and postpartum health, transgender youth sleep health, diabetes and cardiovascular health within Latino communities, and adolescent health and wellbeing.This year, we’re expanding the program to further support groups disproportionately impacted by health disparities. Researchers at academic institutions and nonprofit research organizations in the U.S. are invited to submit their health equity research proposals to the Google Health Equity Research Initiative (HERI) for the chance to win Fitbit devices and Premium, Google Cloud credits or funding. With support from Fitabase, these researchers may also be eligible to win access to remote data collection and analysis tools. Learn more about eligibility and how to apply to this year’s HERI.There are no shortcuts to achieving health equity. Google is committed for the long term to building and maintaining trust with communities who can benefit from our products.To hear more about our work, tune in to the Google Health Equity Summit live stream at 10 a.m. PST on Monday September 12 or watch the recap on our event site."

Our work is centered around connecting voters to the latest election information, helping campaigns and people working on elections improve their cybersecurity and protecting our users and platforms from abuse.",
            "Making election information easily accessible",
            "In the lead-up to elections, voters search for useful and relevant information to help them navigate the electoral process. That’s why we build features that show data from nonpartisan organizations to make it easier for people to get helpful election information.",
            "As we’ve done for many previous elections, we’re rolling out features on Google Search to connect voters with accurate information about voter registration and how to vote. In the coming weeks, when people search for “how to vote'' in both English and Spanish they’ll find election information panels sourced from Democracy Works, a nonpartisan and nonprofit data provider, which works directly with state election administrators to aggregate information about how they can vote in their state, along with key dates and deadlines, and guidance for options like voting early, in-person or by mail. The information panels will also link to state government official websites, which provide more information. And as with previous U.S. elections, we’re working with The Associated Press to present authoritative election results on Google.",
            "We’re also making it easier to find authoritative news coverage on local elections from a range of sources. In addition to helping people find election news from their own communities, we're launching a new feature that will help readers discover local and regional news from different states so they can better understand the election coverage of races they most care about. The feature will be launched in the coming weeks.",
            "On YouTube, our systems are prominently recommending content from authoritative news sources, while limiting the spread of harmful election misinformation.

We understand this reality and are offering these high-risk users best-in-class security tools and resources.",
            "To train and protect the security of people working on elections, we’ve been partnering with organizations like Defending Digital Campaigns, which has provided free security keys to over 300 national committees, state parties and political campaigns in all 50 states. To ensure the strongest account and site-level protections, we offer our free Advanced Protection Program and free Project Shield service to safeguard against digital attacks. Through our Campaign Security Project, we’ve teamed up with organizations across the political spectrum to train over 4,000 campaign and election officials on security best practices, including products and tools they can use to stay safe online.",

            "Preventing abuse on our platforms — such as account hijackings, phishing attempts or orchestrated disinformation campaigns — is always a top priority, especially during sensitive times like elections. Our Trust and Safety teams and Threat Analysis Group are working around the clock to monitor and stop these kinds of digital threats, and we’ve continued to make significant investments in our global operations to ensure our products remain safe and secure.",
            "We also have longstanding policies that prohibit election-related abuse on our platforms. This continues to include policies to combat the spread of election misinformation and demonstrably false claims that could significantly undermine participation or trust in the electoral process, such as false information about polling locations, means of voting, candidate eligibility or election results. As always, we will continue to apply these policies in a neutral and apolitical way.",
            "When it comes to election advertising, we want to make sure voters have confidence in the ads content they may see on our platforms. That's why we require all advertisers to complete a verification process and enforce strict ads policies, such as limiting the way advertisers can target election ads. We've also made significant investments in enhancing transparency around election advertising. In fact, earlier this year we updated our Political Ads Transparency Report, creating a new user interface and adding new tools for accessing and filtering information about targeting, location and formats for specific election ads and advertisers. The new report also includes a more granular breakdown of advertiser data — giving users and researchers greater insight into ad spending and impressions based on the latest Congressional redistricting information. And globally, we’re expanding our election ads verification policies and transparency tools to more countries, including Argentina and Brazil.",

            "Many of us have experienced the frustration of visiting a web page that seems like it has what we’re looking for, but doesn’t live up to our expectations. The content might not have the insights you want, or it may not even seem like it was created for, or even by, a person.We work hard to make sure the pages we show on Search are as helpful and relevant as possible. To do this, we constantly refine our systems: Last year, we launched thousands of updates to Search based on hundreds of thousands of quality tests, including evaluations where we gather feedback from human reviewers.We know people don’t find content helpful if it seems like it was designed to attract clicks rather than inform readers. So starting next week for English users globally, we’re rolling out a series of improvements to Search to make it easier for people to find helpful content made by, and for, people. This ranking work joins a similar effort related to ranking better quality product review content over the past year, which will also receive an update. Together, these launches are part of a broader, ongoing effort to reduce low-quality content and make it easier to find content that feels authentic and useful in Search.Better ranking of original, quality contentWe continually update Search to make sure we're helping you find high quality content. Next week, we'll launch the “helpful content update” to tackle content that seems to have been primarily created for ranking well in search engines rather than to help or inform people. This ranking update will help make sure that unoriginal, low quality content doesn’t rank highly in Search, and our testing has found it will especially improve results related to online education, as well as arts and entertainment, shopping and tech-related content.For example, if you search for information about a new movie, you might have previously seen articles that aggregated reviews from other sites without adding perspectives beyond what’s available elsewhere. This isn’t very helpful if you’re expecting to read something new. With this update, you’ll see more results with unique, authentic information, so you’re more likely to read something you haven't seen before.As always, we'll continue to refine our systems and build on this improvement over time. If you’re a content creator, you can learn more about today’s update and guidance to consider on Search Central.More helpful product reviews written by expertsWe know product reviews can play an important role in helping you make a decision on something to buy. Last year, we kicked off a series of updates to show more helpful, in-depth reviews based on first-hand expertise in search results.We've continued to refine these systems, and in the coming weeks, we’ll roll out another update to make it even easier to find high-quality, original reviews. We’ll continue this work to make sure you find the most useful information when you’re researching a purchase on the web.We hope these updates will help you access more helpful information and valuable perspectives on Search. We look forward to building on this work to make it even easier to find original content by and for real people in the months ahead."

            "Alex Mahadevan is director of MediaWise at the Poynter Institute. He has taught digital media literacy to thousands of middle and high schoolers, and has trained hundreds of journalists from around the world in verification and digital investigative tools. We caught up with Alex to find out about a recent information literacy survey his organization conducted in partnership with YouGov, with support from Google. Learn more about how Google is working on information literacy and helping you spot misinformation online.Why was this survey conducted?Misinformation isn’t a new problem, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction, especially on the internet. We wanted to learn more about how people across generational lines verify information and decide what to trust and share online. And we knew this research would help us expand on the educational resources MediaWise has to offer.What were the parameters for the survey?We surveyed more than 8,500 respondents of various ages in the United States, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany, Nigeria, India and Japan. We asked a wide range of questions aimed at assessing information literacy skills and verification habits. Those include queries about everything from the tools and techniques someone uses to investigate a post they see online, to the reasons why they may have shared misleading information in the past.What are some of the biggest takeaways?The survey found that 62% of respondents think they see false or misleading information on at least a weekly basis – that’s a staggering number. And people are aware that it’s a serious issue. Roughly 50% of all Gen X, Millennial and Gen Z respondents (these are people ages 18 to 57) said they’re concerned about their family being exposed to it.",
            "What did the survey tell you about how people cross-check information they find online?Gen Zers are two times more likely than the Silent Generation (people 68 or older) to use a search engine to verify information, and also two times more likely than Baby Boomers to check social media comments to verify something they’ve seen online. They’re also more likely to use advanced search techniques, like reverse image search, or to engage in lateral reading – that’s when you open multiple tabs and perform multiple searches at once — an effective technique studied by the Stanford History Education Group.We also learned that, when deciding if something they’ve heard or read about is true, respondents across all generations agree that the most important thing is whether conclusions are supported by sources or facts. That was important for us to see: Facts matter.",
            "Any final thoughts?Our findings underscore how important it is to be able to trust the information you find online, and how taking the time to check multiple sources to verify what you see or to use resources like Google Search can be helpful in making sense of a complicated digital landscape. That’s why we’re working together to educate people about information literacy. We have a long running partnership with the Google News Initiative, which has provided support for projects like Find Facts Fast – our free microlearning course which anyone can take via text message or WhatsApp to improve their digital media literacy skills — and the Spanish version, MediaWise en Español.Today we are also announcing a new partnership with Google, Poynter Institute for Media Studies, MediaWise and PBS NewsHour’s Student Reporting Labs to develop weekly information literacy lesson plans for teachers of middle and high school students across the U.S. The lesson plans will be available for free to teachers using PBS LearningMedia and for download on Poynter’s website. We’re excited to build on our partnership to give people the skills they need to recognize misinformation when they see it and help stop its spread."

            "People turn to Google every day for information in the moments that matter most. Sometimes that’s to look for the best recipe for dinner, other times it’s to check the facts about a claim they heard about from a friend.No matter what you’re searching for, we aim to connect you with high-quality information, and help you understand and evaluate that information. We have deeply invested in both information quality and information literacy on Google Search and News, and today we have a few new developments about this important work.Our latest quality improvements to featured snippetsWe design our ranking systems to surface relevant information from the most reliable sources available – sources that demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. We train our systems to identify and prioritize these signals of reliability. And we’re constantly refining these systems — we make thousands of improvements every year to help people get high-quality information quickly.Today we’re announcing one such improvement: a significant innovation to improve the quality of featured snippets. Featured snippets are the descriptive box at the top of the page that prominently highlights a piece of information from a result and the source, in response to your query. They’re helpful both for people searching on Google, and for web publishers, as featured snippets drive traffic to sites.By using our latest AI model, Multitask Unified Model (MUM), our systems can now understand the notion of consensus, which is when multiple high-quality sources on the web all agree on the same fact. Our systems can check snippet callouts (the word or words called out above the featured snippet in a larger font) against other high-quality sources on the web, to see if there’s a general consensus for that callout, even if sources use different words or concepts to describe the same thing. We've found that this consensus-based technique has meaningfully improved the quality and helpfulness of featured snippet callouts.",
            "AI models are also helping our systems understand when a featured snippet might not be the most helpful way to present information. This is particularly helpful for questions where there is no answer: for example, a recent search for “when did snoopy assassinate Abraham Lincoln” provided a snippet highlighting an accurate date and information about Lincoln’s assassination, but this clearly isn’t the most helpful way to display this result.We’ve trained our systems to get better at detecting these sorts of false premises, which are not very common, but are cases where it’s not helpful to show a featured snippet. We’ve reduced the triggering of featured snippets in these cases by 40% with this update.Information literacyBeyond designing our systems to return high-quality information, we also build information literacy features in Google Search that help people evaluate information, whether they found it on social media or in conversations with family or friends. In fact, in a study this year, researchers found that people regularly use Google as a tool to validate information encountered on other platforms. We’ve invested in building a growing range of information literacy features — including Fact Check Explorer, Reverse image search, and About this result — and today, we’re announcing several updates to make these features even more helpful.Expanding About this result to more placesAbout this result helps you see more context about any Search result before you ever visit a web page, just by tapping the three dots next to the result. Since launching last year, people have used About this result more than 2.4 billion times, and we’re bringing it to even more people and places - with eight more languages including Portuguese (PT), French (FR), Italian (IT), German (DE), Dutch (NL), Spanish (ES), Japanese (JP) and Indonesian (ID), coming later this year.This week, we’re adding more context to About this result, such as how widely a source is circulated, online reviews about a source or company, whether a company is owned by another entity, or even when our systems can’t find much info about a source – all pieces of information that can provide important context.And we’ve now launched About this page in the Google app, so you can get helpful context about websites as you’re browsing the web. Just swipe up from the navigation bar on any page to get more information about the source – helping you explore with confidence, no matter where you are online.",
            "Expanding content advisories for information gapsSometimes interest in a breaking news topic travels faster than facts, or there isn’t enough reliable information online about a given subject. Information literacy experts often refer to these situations as data voids. To address these, we show content advisories in situations when a topic is rapidly evolving, indicating that it might be best to check back later when more sources are available.Now we’re expanding content advisories to searches where our systems don’t have high confidence in the overall quality of the results available for the search. This doesn’t mean that no helpful information is available, or that a particular result is low-quality. These notices provide context about the whole set of results on the page, and you can always see the results for your query, even when the advisory is present.",
            "Educating people about misinformationBeyond our products, we’re making investments into programs and partnerships to help educate people about misinformation. Since 2018, the Google News Initiative (GNI) has invested nearly $75 million in projects and partnerships working to strengthen media literacy and combat misinformation around the world.Today, we’re announcing that Google is partnering with MediaWise at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies and PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs to develop information literacy lesson plans for teachers of middle and high school students. It will be available for free to teachers using PBS Learning Media and for download on Poynter’s website. We’ve partnered with MediaWise since it was founded. And today’s announcement builds on the GNI’s support of its microlearning course through text and WhatsApp called Find Facts Fast.We also announced today the results of a survey conducted by the Poynter Institute and YouGov, with support from Google, on the ways people across generational lines verify information.

            "Sometimes people know they absolutely, positively only want webpages that mention a particular word or phrase. For example, maybe you want to find out about phone chargers but only those that support wireless charging. Fortunately, Google Search has a special operator for that: quotation marks. Put quotes around any word or phrase, such as [“wireless phone chargers”], and we’ll only show pages that contain those exact words or phrases.Now we’re making quoted searches better. The snippets we display for search results (meaning the text you see describing web content) will be formed around where a quoted word or phrase occurs in a web document. That means you can more easily identify where to find them after you click the link and visit the content. On desktop, we’ll also bold the quoted material.For example, if you did a search such as [“google search”], the snippet will show where that exact phrase appears:",
            "In the past, we didn’t always do this because sometimes the quoted material appears in areas of a document that don’t lend themselves to creating helpful snippets. For example, a word or phrase might appear in the menu item of a page, where you’d navigate to different sections of the site. Creating a snippet around sections like that might not produce an easily readable description.We’ve heard feedback that people doing quoted searches value seeing where the quoted material occurs on a page, rather than an overall description of the page. Our improvement is designed to help address this.Things to keep in mind about quoted searchesFor those doing quoted searches, here are some more tips, along with caveats on how quoted searching works.Quoted searches may match content not readily visible on a page. As referenced above, sometimes quoted searches match content contained within a web page that isn’t readily visible, making it seem like the content isn’t on the page when it actually is present.For example, content in a meta description tag is looked at for matches, even though that content isn’t visible on the web page itself. ALT text that describes images is considered, as is the text within a page’s URL. Material brought in through inline frames (iframes) is also matched. Google may also see content that doesn’t initially load on a page when you go to it, such content rendered through JavaScript that only appears if you click to make it display.Pro tip: Sometimes people use the standard Find command in a browser to jump to the phrase they want, after arriving on a page. If that doesn’t work, though, you can try using a developer tools option. For instance, in Chrome, you can search from within Developer Tools to match against all rendered text, which would include the text in drop-down menus and other areas of the site.Pages may have changed since Google last visited them. While Google revisits pages across the web regularly, they can change in between visits. This means quoted material might appear on a page when we saw it, but it no longer exists on the current page. If available, viewing the Google cached copy may show where the quoted content appeared on the version of the page we visited.Quoted terms may only appear in title links and URLs. Quoted terms won’t appear in web page snippets if they only appear within title links or URLs of a web page. We also do not bold matches that happen in title links and URLs.Punctuation is sometimes seen as spaces. Our systems see some punctuation as spaces, which impacts quoted searches. For example, a search for [“don’t doesn’t”] tells our systems to find content that contains all these letters in this order:don t doesn tAs a result, we’ll match content like the ones below, where punctuation like commas or hyphens break up words — because when you remove the punctuation, the letter patterns are the same:don’t, doesn’tdon’t / doesn’tdon’t - doesn’tSnippets might not show multiple quoted terms. If a search involves multiple quoted terms, the snippet may not show all of them if they are far apart from each other. Similarly, if quoted material appears several times on a page, a snippet will show what seems to be the most relevant occurrence.We mainly bold quoted content for web page snippets on desktop.Our new bolding of quoted content generally only works for web page snippets on desktop. Bolding won’t appear in snippets for recipe or video boxes, and it also won’t appear when using some special modes such as image or news search. However, anything listed in these boxes or special modes will contain the quoted terms. Bolding also doesn’t work for mobile results.Quoted searches don’t work for local results. Quote restriction does not work for results in our local box where listings usually appear with a map; we’ll be looking more at this area in the future.To quote or not to quote?Using quotes can definitely be a great tool for power users. We generally recommend first doing any search in natural language without resorting to operators like quotation marks. Years ago, many people used operators because search engines sometimes needed additional guidance. Things have advanced since then, so operators are often no longer necessary.By default, our systems are designed to look for both the exact words and phrases entered and related terms and concepts, which is often useful. If you use a quoted search, you might miss helpful content that uses closely related words.Of course, there are those times when the exact word being on a page makes all the difference. For those situations, quoted searches remain available and are now even better."

            "When I was 5, our family moved from New York City to the countryside outside of the city. My brother and I were the only kids of Asian descent in our elementary school. Our father was born in Yamaguchi, Japan to a Japanese mother and American father, and I always felt proud of that — but in this new environment, I instantly felt different.These early experiences showed me just how important it is to show up for and with communities. Over the past two years, COVID-related small business closures and targeted acts of violence have reinforced the importance and impact of allyship — and have underscored how critical it is to support historically marginalized communities, including our Asian community. That’s why we’re announcing a new way to help Asian-owned businesses thrive.",
            "Celebrating Asian-owned businessesStarting today, US businesses can now add the Asian-owned attribute to their Business Profile on Search and Maps. In the coming weeks, ad-supported publishers will be able to identify as Asian-owned in Display & Video 360’s Marketplace, too.",
            "Businesses can opt in to adopt the attribute on their Business Profile and can easily opt out at any time. Once the attribute appears on a Business Profile, users will also be able to see the attribute. This update builds on the Black-owned, Latino-owned, veteran-owned, women-owned and LGBTQ+ owned business attributes, and is another way people can support a diversity of businesses across Google’s products and platforms.As we were building this feature, we worked with hundreds of Asian-owned businesses to ensure the attribute celebrates our diverse and unique cultures. During that process, I was particularly struck by what Dennys Han, owner of East West Shop, shared with us about the power of community: “If someone is trying to accomplish something, the entire local Korean community will band together to help it come together. The idea of the community and group as a whole uplifting each other is fundamental to what we do.”",
            "Building up Asian-owned businesses’ digital skillsOver the past few years, Grow with Google has partnered with the US Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce (USPAACC) to help Asian-owned small businesses grow. To date, we’ve helped more than 20,000 Asian-owned businesses expand their digital skills through workshops focusing on topics like e-commerce tools, design thinking for entrepreneurs and making decisions using analytics.Today, we’re building upon that partnership. Together, USPAACC and Grow with Google will help an additional 10,000 Asian-owned small businesses gain digital skills to help them grow their businesses. And as the internet continues to grow in importance for shopping, nearly one quarter of Asian-owned business owners said their most important channel towards building community and financial support was across social media and online.It’s our hope the Asian-owned attribute brings people together and provides our communities with much-needed recognition: to help them be seen and thrive. We are excited to spotlight Asian-owned businesses and highlight part of what makes our community unique and important."

            "Three out of four people in the United States come to the internet first with questions about their health and wellness. The pandemic has exacerbated the need for high-quality, timely and actionable health information — in fact, since 2020, people are searching for “mental health hotline” twice as much as they did before. On Search, we work to connect people in crisis situations to reliable support as quickly as possible.Today, when you search for information about suicide prevention in the U.S., you’ll find a new, easy-to-remember hotline number and chat support at the top of your search results. We’ve updated this to reflect the new national mental health crisis hotline number, 988. Services are provided by the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, a network of more than 200 state and local call centers funded by the U.S. Department of Health and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).Suicide is a leading cause of death among people of all ages globally. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide is the second-leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10-14 and 25-34 in the U.S. While Google has included suicide prevention information at the top of relevant search results for many years, this new hotline will make it easier for people in emotional distress and seeking mental health support to get help.",
            "With search interest in mental health resources reaching record highs this year, 988 provides a critical lifeline for those in need. \"Hope has a new number, and it's 988,\" says Dr. John Draper, Executive Director of 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. \"This is a historic moment in our country's approach to mental health. When people call or text 988, they will be connected to trained counselors who will hear them, support them and connect them to resources. With this transition to 988, our hope is to reach so many more people in emotional crisis, and connect them to care.\"",
            "For over a decade, we’ve worked closely with crisis support providers to help people navigate topics like suicide, substance use disorders and domestic violence. In addition to returning helpful information from reliable sources for related queries, we work with local suicide crisis partners to surface high-quality information around the world. Beyond the U.S., suicide hotlines are available in dozens of countries and we recently expanded the feature to Costa Rica, Pakistan and Belgium. We’ll continue working to bring this feature to even more countries.People come to Google looking for information in critical moments, and access to high-quality information is crucial to helping them navigate those moments safely. Providing hotline resources is one way we’re continuing to help people stay safe while they search."

            "A couple of years ago, my partner and I moved to Kentucky, not knowing anyone in the state. Before moving, I extensively researched local websites and online magazines, trying to understand the neighborhoods and get a sense of the community. Somewhere along the way I found Lussi Brown Coffee Bar, a local business run by by a queer woman. Not knowing whether I’d get a response, I eagerly reached out through email, asking questions to get a sense of the community. To my delight, the owner, Sarah Brown (she/they), quickly responded and provided an overview of the rich history of the LGBTQ+ community in Lexington. And of course, she shared recommendations of some of their favorite LGBTQ+ owned businesses in the state too!As we moved into town, Sarah and their girlfriend welcomed us with open arms, very much making the community immediately feel like home. And our physical home brought that same love, too. Unintentionally, we rented an apartment on a short street filled with LGBTQ+ folks from their 20s through their 70s — in fact, our neighbors called it Kentucky’s “Barbary Lane,” a nod to the tight knit, beloved street of LGBTQ+ folks in Armistead Maupin’s novel “Tales of the City.”",
            "With that same spirit, we want to make it easier for others to find LGBTQ+ owned businesses in their own community. Starting today, merchants in the U.S. with a verified Business Profile on Google can add an LGBTQ+ owned attribute to their profile, making it easier for customers to find and support them through Search and Maps. This new offering joins the Black-owned, Latino-owned, veteran-owned and women-owned business attributes we already offer, and is yet another way people can support diverse businesses.",
            "This builds on our previous work with the globally available LGBTQ+ friendly and transgender safespace attributes, and offers a more objective attribute that only businesses can add to their profiles.The LGBTQ+ community represents nearly 8% of the total adult American population, with 20% of Gen Z identifying as a member of the community. As the number of LGBTQ+ individuals increase, so does our presence and prominence in our communities. In fact, there are 1.4 million LGBTQ-run companies in the U.S. Over the past decade, Google has partnered with the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC) and 30 local affiliate chambers to support and grow LGBTQ+ owned businesses and organizations. NGLCC certified businesses generate over $1.7 trillion in economic impact and help create jobs nationwide. To date, Grow with Google’s partnership with the NGLCC has helped thousands of LGBTQ+ owned businesses grow their digital skills and thrive online.",
            "As we celebrate Pride, it’s important to remember visibility and representation are critical, all year round. A flag in the window of a small business has the power to bring queer folks together, to celebrate our joy, honor our history, and fight for our diverse community. It’s our hope that this attribute will allow business owners to celebrate their identity and community with the world."

Over the course of the pandemic, finding timely, reliable and locally relevant information has been critically important, and people have often turned to Google first to make sense of the new environment. Ever since Search interest in coronavirus hit an all-time high in March 2020 worldwide, people’s searches have changed as we’ve moved into new phases of the pandemic.As the pandemic evolves, so do people’s information needs. Our goal is to continue providing timely, fresh and actionable information as some people return to offices, explore travel around the world and navigate everyday life in the safest ways possible.Supporting evolving testing needsAt-home testing is a helpful and convenient way to minimize community spread through awareness of COVID status. In the United States alone, search interest in “at home covid tests” increased by 170% in May 2022. So starting this month in the U.S., people can more easily find at-home COVID test kits on Google Search. With a quick Search, you can quickly see at-home testing kits available in stores, and nearby testing information provided by local health authorities.",

Last spring, we introduced a new option to turn on tracking for these advisories right from the Search results page. You receive an email if the travel requirements change for your selected destination if you’re logged into your Google account. For the United States, you can also view and track travel advisories at the state level.",

This information also includes support for pediatric vaccinations as kids head to summer camp and participate in other seasonal activities. In the U.S, when parents search for “covid vaccine for kids” they can quickly find healthcare providers that offer COVID pediatric vaccinations.Amplifying authoritative informationCollaborating with trusted partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has been critical to getting people the information they need at the right time. We’ve also helped amplify important messages from public health authorities by donating Google Search advertising and related expert assistance. Through this initiative, the WHO has provided more than two billion COVID-related public service announcements, connecting nearly 250 million people to high-quality COVID-19 Information. We recently pledged an additional $150 million in donated Search ads — bringing our total in-kind commitment to more than $1 billion with the overarching goal of connecting people to authoritative information related to COVID-19 and related topics as they search on Google.To make sure people can easily find the information they need about COVID, we’ve built and grown a number of features that further our goal of making healthcare information more accessible to everyone. As the world continues to navigate COVID, Google remains committed to helping reduce friction in accessing health information and care for all."

            "Googler Mor Schlesinger, who heads up the Climate and Crisis Response team, shares her insights.What led you to your current role?I was a serial entrepreneur, working in tech since I was 17, and was looking to create my next startup when someone at Google asked me to join the organization. I now lead the new Climate and Crisis Response teams within Search. It was clearly needed because people were coming to Google in the millions – people affected by floods, wildfires, and other climate crises – to find timely, helpful and actionable information. I joined because I wanted to impact society at large and Google offered the platform to do it at scale.What’s the most innovative feature that you’ve worked on that has had the most impact on people?Definitely SOS Alerts. It’s one of our most innovative products and a great example of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being used to help people prepare ahead of a crisis and stay informed. The guiding principle of SOS Alerts is ‘expect the unexpected,’ because crisis events are so dynamic and unpredictable. So it can help people in the midst of natural disasters – from earthquakes, wildfires and floods – to man-made disasters such as war. So of course it’s very relevant to the situation in Ukraine, where SOS Alerts have provided accurate and timely information in the region.How exactly does it help people?In times of crisis, people need information to make life or death decisions within minutes. So people come to Google and tend to ask four fundamental questions, ‘What is happening?’ ‘Where is it happening?’ ‘What do we need to do?’ and ‘How can we help?’ We build our product to help with these questions, so we make it easy for people to get authoritative and locally relevant information to help them navigate the crisis.",
            "What’s been the most significant moment in your career in Search so far?There hasn’t really been a significant moment, it’s more a sense throughout my time here that I've been able to have, literally, a life saving impact on people. It really hit home when I was scanning through user feedback and I saw the words, “Thank you Google you saved my life!” I thought wow. It’s such a privilege to be able to help people – for a job. It’s so amazing!Where was that person?They were close to a shooting incident and didn’t know what was happening. They’d heard shots and saw people running, then they checked Google and found out that they needed to stay put and take cover.Where do you see the biggest progress being made in tracking our changing environment in the next 3-5 years?I think at the intersection between climate and crisis, which is basically climate change. And one thing we know about climate change is that we’re going to see more frequent and more severe natural disasters. Advances in artificial intelligence together with search mean we can give advance notifications to users in life-threatening situations and enable them to act. For example, if we think that you’re in danger of an earthquake, we can issue early warnings to all Android phones in the area. Studies show that if you get to people before a crisis, you have nine times more impact.What excites you about the future of Search and the real-life impact it can have?For me personally, I think it's the intersection between climate and technology. We can all do our individual parts to mitigate climate change, but I believe that it’s the largest crisis that we face as humanity. And when I think about how we can help in this huge effort globally, well, I feel privileged to take part."

            "In my time at Google, UK publishers of every political leaning have asked me why they don't rank higher in Search. My answer is always the same: search ranking is based on many things, but British politics is not one of them.We go to great lengths to build our products and enforce our policies in ways that don't take political leanings into account. People trust Google to deliver relevant results; distorting results for political purposes would undermine that trust and hurt our business.This question comes down to the fundamentals of how Search works. When you type in a query, there could be thousands or even millions of webpages or other information that might be relevant. In a fraction of a second, Google’s Search automated systems sort through this to find the most relevant, useful results for what you’re looking for. There are hundreds of factors that determine which results are shown – from quality and freshness to the words of your query, expertise of sources, and the searcher’s location and settings.We know Search can always be better. That’s why we conduct hundreds of thousands of experiments every year and get feedback from third-party Search Quality Raters, resulting in thousands of improvements, all of which are rigorously tested.Along with our own testing, independent studies including by Stanford and The Economist have demonstrated there is no political bias in Search and News results. As the Economist concluded: “Google rewards reputable reporting, not left-wing politics”. Other UK publishers have also conducted their own research.These questions come in from all sides and we’re always happy to explain how our systems work. As long as I keep getting these kinds of queries from every corner of the political spectrum, I'll know we’re doing our job."

If you have an adventure on the horizon, here are two ways you can use Google tools to stay safe and healthy during your summer activities.Check the air quality before you head outWhen you're visiting a new place or planning outdoor activities, it can be helpful to know the air quality conditions — like whether it’s unusually smoggy. Check out the air quality layer on Google Maps for both Android and iOS, to help you make more informed decisions about whether it’s safe to go on a hike or other outdoor adventures. You’ll see Air Quality Index (AQI), a measure of how healthy (or unhealthy) the air is, along with guidance for outdoor activities, when the information was last updated, and links to learn more.The air quality layer shows trusted data from government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. We are also showing air quality information from PurpleAir, a low-cost sensor network which gives a more hyperlocal view of conditions. To add the air quality layer to your map, simply tap on the button in the top right corner of your screen, then select Air Quality under Map details.You can also view air quality information from PurpleAir on Nest displays and speakers. The broad coverage of PurpleAir sensors means significantly more people in the U.S. will be able to access vital air quality information directly from their Nest devices.",

            "Catherine is an Engineering Director for Search and a Tech Site Lead in the Google London office. She’s been managing software engineering teams since the early 90’s and joined Google in 2017 to lead the engineering team working on the Google mobile app.What’s your favorite feature on mobile?It’s got to be Hum to Search, without a doubt. If you go into the Google app on your phone and press the microphone button, you can hum a song and it will tell you what the song is. This has helped me quickly identify a tune so many times!We do have a rigorous testing process, even for fun features like this, to make sure these things are something users can use and actually want. It’s a continuation of the Search premise, to keep answering the questions that niggle at you – but this time via audio.What excites you about the future of Search?Probably the fact that it simply keeps getting more helpful as we combine our understanding of text, voice and images — so you’ll be able to find helpful information about whatever you see, hear and experience, in ways that are most intuitive to you. We’ve developed a helpful new capability called multisearch, which means you can search with images and text at the same time. So even if you don’t have the words to describe what you’re looking for, you can get help. For example, you can search for similar products in a different color, or take a picture of wallpaper and ask for it on a blanket instead, or even how to look after the basil plant on your windowsill. We’re envisioning a future where you can search your whole world, any way and anywhere.",
            "You’ve said before that software engineering is a very social thing. Can you expand on this?We have an incredible team working on Search — people developing the machine learning models, the services, the software on the phone. How well those people communicate determines how well the software fits together, so it’s important people have psychological safety in the job. If they do, it means easy feedback mechanisms, good communication and tight team work.It’s also down to leadership to make sure teams realize everyone has to succeed for the business to — that it’s really not a competition. When looking for our future Search stars, the whole person matters, not just their skills — so will you put users first, do the right thing, work well with others and create an inclusive environment? Those questions really help determine the right fit.What do you think is a lesser known, but really useful fact about Search?We’ve got a newish feature called ‘About this result’. When you’re searching for something, you can click an icon that then tells you more about how our systems determined a result might be a good match for your search. You can also find important context about a source or topic, before you visit a website. We’re trying to help people develop information literacy skills — so they can have more context about the sources of their information and understand how Search works.What do you enjoy most about working on a product like Search?Just the impact. We have billions of users. Lots of people are relying on our information to help them in their daily lives, help them in extreme situations, help them always. It’s really nice to work on something you know people need and want. We are helpful — that’s it really. I rely on it – it’s how I live in my world. I worked in computers long before the internet, and I grew up spending hours in the library just looking things up – Search coming along changed all that. If you’d told me about this as a teenager I would have told you you were crazy!"

            "Guy is lead product manager at the Journalist Studio, where he works on tools to support the work of journalists.Tell us about your work in Search and how it helps journalists worldwide.My team works on Google Trends and Pinpoint, amongst other products that are still in incubation. All sit within the Journalist Studio, which is a collection of tools that help journalists to do their work more efficiently, creatively, and securely.How is Google Trends helpful for journalists?Being able to see what people are searching for gives an accurate insight into the topics of the day – or indeed month or year, spanning anything from sporting events and seasonal recipes to news stories and celebrity gossip. It’s therefore super useful to journalists, who use Google Trends a lot – to help them uncover new story ideas, or to complement their research and enhance their storytelling. Every year we share a Year In Search round up, and it’s hugely exciting for our team to see media around the world talking about the changing themes that are shown.What problem does Pinpoint solve for journalists?Reporters often have to spend a lot of time sifting through large collections of handwritten documents, images and audio recordings. This material can range from freedom of information requests, which can return hundreds of thousands of documents, to court hearing transcripts or police reports. Similarly, audio material can be lengthy interviews or weekly council meeting recordings and so on. Sometimes reporters know what they’re looking for and sometimes they have to skim thousands of pages or listen to hours of audio just to figure it out – and often with intense deadlines looming.Using advanced AI, Pinpoint processes documents and images, and indexes them so users can search for keywords, or easily find names of people, places or organizations. Similarly, it transcribes audio recordings, turning them into searchable text. So for reporters, it’s taking a task that would have taken a few people weeks to achieve, and shrinking it into a task that they can do alone, and more accurately, in just a few hours. We’ve had incredible feedback from journalists across the globe about how Pinpoint is an amazing time saver.Academic researchers and students also find Pinpoint useful and so we also allow them access too.",
            "What’s been the most exciting part of working on Pinpoint?The initial research was fascinating because it was quite a new world for our team. We spent a lot of time attending journalistic conferences, running user studies to hear about what they needed, paying attention not just to what they were saying but also to what they weren’t saying, to see if there were deeper needs that we could solve.I was most excited about the immersion trips where the team spent two or three days in newsrooms around the world from early morning to evening. We saw everything from how they run their editorial meetings to how they make their coffee, their running jokes, and so on – really immersing ourselves into their professional life.So it was about learning and distilling the huge breadth of their needs on the one hand, and exploring a broad set of Google’s technological capabilities on the other. Then bringing them together. It was really exciting to find the sweet spot of where those two intersected."

When the pandemic started, founders Dina and Omar had to close their physical showroom, which used to drive 90% of their sales. They listed their business details on Google Maps and Search, promoted their products online and revamped their website which, in less than a year, became their main source of revenue.According to a new report published by Public First research agency and commissioned by Google, our products and tools in the UAE, Egypt and Saudi Arabia helped businesses to adapt during the pandemic and helped people sharpen their skills and find jobs.The report shows 45% of people in Egypt last year used Google Maps to find a local business and 52% of businesses in Saudi Arabia reported an increased proportion of their customers coming from online search or search advertising.",
            "Since opening our first office in the Middle East and North Africa 13 years ago, Google has been actively supporting local businesses and developers, YouTube content creators, and publishers. Public First estimates that last year Google products like Search, YouTube, Android and Google Ads drove 12.2 billion SAR [3.2 billion USD] to the Saudi economy, 11.3 billion AED [3 billion USD] to the UAE economy and 11.2 billion EGP [600 million USD] to Egypt's economy.Growing developers and creators",

She started her YouTube channel to share her knowledge in upcycling dresses and scarves to make trousers, and repainting her room for Ramadan. Manal’s work has inspired others, and her community often share their own versions of her designs and ask for DIY tips. When she built her channel during the pandemic, her subscribers grew by over 300%. Manal is one of many talented creators in Saudi Arabia growing their business on YouTube. In fact, the percentage of YouTube channels in Saudi Arabia making six figures or more in revenue is up more than 20% year over year. That's a sign of steady growth in Saudi Arabia’s YouTube creator community.",
            "Lamsa World is an educational platform in Arabic for children. It has interactive courses in math, science, language, arts and more. Badr Ward, the Dubai-based founder, wanted to help his children watch more educational content in Arabic, which was sparse and not always engaging. Badr and his team took part in the Google Accelerator Program in Dubai last year and, with the help of mentors, tested different sign-up options and experimented with different content formats. This led to a significant increase in the website's sign-up rates and a 300% increase in Arabic content downloads.Unlocking skills and jobsSince its launch in 2018, Maharat min Google, Google's digital skills program in Arabic, has trained 1.5 million people in the Middle East and North Africa. And in October 2020, Google announced a $13 million USD fund for digital tools, training programs, mentorship and financial grants to support businesses and job seekers in the Middle East and North Africa during the pandemic. Following Google's mentorship program with Mercy Corps, 50% of trainees said that they found a job, accelerated their career or grew their business by hiring new staff or increasing revenue.Google Search also played a big role in helping people in the region access information and skills last year. For example, 85% of people in the UAE said they used Search to learn a new skill.People looked for jobs too. Every month, around 11 million women in Egypt go to Search to look for a job. In Saudi Arabia, 1.8 million people use Search to prepare for a job interview. According to the World Economic Forum, many women are contributing to the innovation coming out of the Middle East and North Africa, yet this region continues to have one of the lowest levels of female economic involvement globally.Public First estimates there are already 85,000 Android-based developer jobs in Egypt and 50,000 in the UAE. In Saudi Arabia, the total number of developers making USD 10,000 per month on Google Play grew by 16% last year.We are proud that people in the Middle East and North Africa are able to unlock opportunities for themselves with the help of Google products and tools. The region is young, smart and digital, and Google is committed to doing more to help entrepreneurs, local business owners, developers and content creators get the skills they need to build and grow their digital businesses.If you want to understand more about Google's impact in the Middle East and North Africa, and the methodology behind the report, visit the links below:UAE: googlemena.publicfirst.co/uaeSaudi Arabia: googlemena.publicfirst.co/saudiarabiaEgypt: googlemena.publicfirst.co/egypt"

            "When you or someone you care for is going through a mental health situation, it can feel isolating, overwhelming and distressing. To get through those moments, access to the right resources can make all the difference.Anxiety and depression increased by 25% across the globe during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and hospitals and doctor groups recently called mental health a national emergency for adolescents. With these issues on the rise, searches for \"mental health therapist\" and \"mental health help\" reached record highs this year in the U.S.Against the backdrop of the global pandemic, geopolitical crises and economic concerns also hit home for many Americans. To help support mental health challenges stemming from these issues, our goal is to surface authoritative information you can trust, create access to helpful resources you need in the moment and show empathy for everyone facing mental health issues. So in recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month in the U.S., here are tools built to support you when you need it most.",
            "Resources for those in crisisWe know that many people turn to Search to get actionable information during a personal crisis, whether it’s related to suicide, sexual assault, substance abuse or domestic violence. In the coming weeks, we’ll update Search to use our AI model MUM to automatically and more accurately detect personal crisis searches in order to show you the most relevant information when you need it.We’ve also made it easier to access clinically-validated mental health self-assessments from Search for conditions such as depression, anxiety, postpartum depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These self-assessments, frequently used by medical professionals, are meant to help people understand how their self-reported symptoms might map to known mental health conditions.On YouTube, updates to our crisis response panels better connect you with timely and important resources. For years, YouTube has shown crisis resource panels on certain search queries to connect people with local organizations that can help them through a moment of critical need. Now, crisis resource panels appear on the Watch Page and in search results. The number of topics that display crisis resources in YouTube search results has also expanded to include issues like depression, sexual assault and substance abuse.",

            "Technology shines when it helps us get things done in our daily lives, and that’s exactly why a group of around 100 very eager seniors gathered in Odense, Denmark. All older than 65, many up to 85, they decided to stay on top of the latest technological tricks and tools. On this March day, the eye-opener was the often overlooked potential in searching for information using visual tools, like Google Lens.So now the seniors searched their surroundings directly: Scanned trees, plants, animals and buildings, used Translate to get hold of Turkish language menu cards or Japanese sayings, and found product declarations through barcode scanning.The group was taking part in a training set up by Faglige Seniorer, which organizes 300,000 seniors in total. They first partnered with Google back in 2019 to train seniors in using voice to search, and now the time had come to use live images.",

Now I can just take a picture to discover what kind of plant I am standing before,” Verner Madsen, one of the participants, remarked. “I don’t need to bring my encyclopedia. It is really smart and helpful.”Seniors in a country like Denmark are generally very tech savvy, but with digitization constantly advancing — accelerating even faster during two years of COVID-19 — some seniors risk being left behind, creating gaps between generations. During worldwide lockdowns, technological tools have helped seniors stay connected with their family and friends, and smartphone features have helped improve everyday life. One key element of that is delivering accurate and useful information when needed. And for that, typed words on a smartphone keyboard can often be substituted with a visual search, using a single tap on the screen.Being able to \"search what you see\" in this way was an eye-opener to many. As the day ended, another avid participant, Henrik Rasmussen, declared he was heading straight home to continue his practice.“I thought I was up to speed on digital developments, but after today I realize that I still have a lot to learn and discover,” he said."

        "article_paragraphs": [
            "Seeing yourself reflected in the world around you — in real life, media or online — is so important. And we know that challenges with image-based technologies and representation on the web have historically left people of color feeling overlooked and misrepresented. Last year, we announced Real Tone for Pixel, which is just one example of our efforts to improve representation of diverse skin tones across Google products.Today, we're introducing a next step in our commitment to image equity and improving representation across our products. In partnership with Harvard professor and sociologist Dr. Ellis Monk, we’re releasing a new skin tone scale designed to be more inclusive of the spectrum of skin tones we see in our society. Dr. Monk has been studying how skin tone and colorism affect people’s lives for more than 10 years.The culmination of Dr. Monk’s research is the Monk Skin Tone (MST) Scale, a 10-shade scale that will be incorporated into various Google products over the coming months. We’re openly releasing the scale so anyone can use it for research and product development. Our goal is for the scale to support inclusive products and research across the industry — we see this as a chance to share, learn and evolve our work with the help of others.",
            "This scale was designed to be easy-to-use for development and evaluation of technology while representing a broader range of skin tones. In fact, our research found that amongst participants in the U.S., people found the Monk Skin Tone Scale to be more representative of their skin tones compared to the current tech industry standard. This was especially true for people with darker skin tones.“In our research, we found that a lot of the time people feel they’re lumped into racial categories, but there’s all this heterogeneity with ethnic and racial categories,” Dr. Monk says. “And many methods of categorization, including past skin tone scales, don’t pay attention to this diversity. That’s where a lack of representation can happen…we need to fine-tune the way we measure things, so people feel represented.”",
            "Using the Monk Skin Tone Scale to improve Google productsUpdating our approach to skin tone can help us better understand representation in imagery, as well as evaluate whether a product or feature works well across a range of skin tones. This is especially important for computer vision, a type of AI that allows computers to see and understand images. When not built and tested intentionally to include a broad range of skin-tones, computer vision systems have been found to not perform as well for people with darker skin.The MST Scale will help us and the tech industry at large build more representative datasets so we can train and evaluate AI models for fairness, resulting in features and products that work better for everyone — of all skin tones. For example, we use the scale to evaluate and improve the models that detect faces in images.Here are other ways you’ll see this show up in Google products.Improving skin tone representation in SearchEvery day, millions of people search the web expecting to find images that reflect their specific needs. That’s why we’re also introducing new features using the MST Scale to make it easier for people of all backgrounds to find more relevant and helpful results.For example, now when you search for makeup related queries in Google Images, you'll see an option to further refine your results by skin tone. So if you’re looking for “everyday eyeshadow” or “bridal makeup looks” you’ll more easily find results that work better for your needs.",
            "Seeing yourself represented in results can be key to finding information that's truly relevant and useful, which is why we’re also rolling out improvements to show a greater range of skin tones in image results for broad searches about people, or ones where people show up in the results. In the future, we’ll incorporate the MST Scale to better detect and rank images to include a broader range of results, so everyone can find what they're looking for.Creating a more representative Search experience isn’t something we can do alone, though. How content is labeled online is a key factor in how our systems surface relevant results. In the coming months, we'll also be developing a standardized way to label web content. Creators, brands and publishers will be able to use this new inclusive schema to label their content with attributes like skin tone, hair color and hair texture. This will make it possible for content creators or online businesses to label their imagery in a way that search engines and other platforms can easily understand.",
            "Improving skin tone representation in Google PhotosWe’ll also be using the MST Scale to improve Google Photos. Last year, we introduced an improvement to our auto enhance feature in partnership with professional image makers. Now we’re launching a new set of Real Tone filters that are designed to work well across skin tones and evaluated using the MST Scale. We worked with a diverse range of renowned image makers, like Kennedi Carter and Joshua Kissi, who are celebrated for beautiful and accurate depictions of their subjects, to evaluate, test and build these filters.

            "What’s next?We’re openly releasing the Monk Skin Tone Scale so that others can use it in their own products, and learn from this work — and so that we can partner with and learn from them. We want to get feedback, drive more interdisciplinary research, and make progress together. We encourage you to share your thoughts here. We’re continuing to collaborate with Dr. Monk to evaluate the MST Scale across different regions and product applications, and we’ll iterate and improve on it to make sure the scale works for people and use cases all over the world. And, we’ll continue our efforts to make Google’s products work even better for every user.The best part of working on this project is that it isn’t just ours — while we’re committed to making Google products better and more inclusive, we’re also excited about all the possibilities that exist as we work together to build for everyone across the web."

            "People have always gathered information in a variety of ways — from talking to others, to observing the world around them, to, of course, searching online. Though typing words into a search box has become second nature for many of us, it’s far from the most natural way to express what we need. For example, if I’m walking down the street and see an interesting tree, I might point to it and ask a friend what species it is and if they know of any nearby nurseries that might sell seeds. If I were to express that question to a search engine just a few years ago… well, it would have taken a lot of queries.But we’ve been working hard to change that. We've already started on a journey to make searching more natural. Whether you're humming the tune that's been stuck in your head, or using Google Lens to search visually (which now happens more than 8 billion times per month!), there are more ways to search and explore information than ever before.Today, we're redefining Google Search yet again, combining our understanding of all types of information — text, voice, visual and more — so you can find helpful information about whatever you see, hear and experience, in whichever ways are most intuitive to you. We envision a future where you can search your whole world, any way and anywhere.Find local information with multisearchThe recent launch of multisearch, one of our most significant updates to Search in several years, is a milestone on this path. In the Google app, you can search with images and text at the same time — similar to how you might point at something and ask a friend about it.Now we’re adding a way to find local information with multisearch, so you can uncover what you need from the millions of local businesses on Google. You’ll be able to use a picture or screenshot and add “near me” to see options for local restaurants or retailers that have the apparel, home goods and food you’re looking for.",
            "For example, say you see a colorful dish online you’d like to try – but you don’t know what’s in it, or what it’s called. When you use multisearch to find it near you, Google scans millions of images and reviews posted on web pages, and from our community of Maps contributors, to find results about nearby spots that offer the dish so you can go enjoy it for yourself.Local information in multisearch will be available globally later this year in English, and will expand to more languages over time.Get a more complete picture with scene explorationToday, when you search visually with Google, we’re able to recognize objects captured in a single frame. But sometimes, you might want information about a whole scene in front of you.In the future, with an advancement called “scene exploration,” you’ll be able to use multisearch to pan your camera and instantly glean insights about multiple objects in a wider scene.",
            "Imagine you’re trying to pick out the perfect candy bar for your friend who's a bit of a chocolate connoisseur. You know they love dark chocolate but dislike nuts, and you want to get them something of quality. With scene exploration, you’ll be able to scan the entire shelf with your phone’s camera and see helpful insights overlaid in front of you. Scene exploration is a powerful breakthrough in our devices’ ability to understand the world the way we do – so you can easily find what you’re looking for– and we look forward to bringing it to multisearch in the future.These are some of the latest steps we’re taking to help you search any way and anywhere. But there’s more we’re doing, beyond Search. AI advancements are helping bridge the physical and digital worlds in Google Maps, and making it possible to interact with the Google Assistant more naturally and intuitively. To ensure information is truly useful for people from all communities, it’s also critical for people to see themselves represented in the results they find. Underpinning all these efforts is our commitment to helping you search safely, with new ways to control your online presence and information."

            "First, can you tell us about the Google News Initiative and the work that your team does?",
            "The Google News Initiative is the part of Google that works with journalists and entrepreneurs to drive innovation in news — from surfacing factual information to helping local publishers to digitize their content.As part of that, the News Lab offers partnerships and training in 70 countries around the world to bring Google technology to journalists and news publishers. We want to help strengthen digital skills to help journalists verify sources, fact check and explore different forms of storytelling for audiences searching for accurate information.",
            "Tell us about your background and what led to working at Google.",
            "I worked for a number of years at BBC in various roles, including reporting from the East London multimedia newsroom in the build-up to the 2012 Olympic Games. We gave members of the audience access to small cameras, which got me thinking about the potential of digital storytelling. So when the opportunity came along at Google, I seized it! I’m coming up to my 10th anniversary here.",
            "What tips can you give readers searching for credible news and information?",
            "News comes to us in so many different ways and formats these days so it can sometimes be hard to tell what's authoritative and accurate. But there are tools available to help, and there are five things I would recommend when it comes to checking authenticity:If you’ve stumbled across something surprising, check the source. The About This Result feature provides details about a website before you visit it, including its description, when it was first indexed and whether your connection to the site is secure.If an image looks suspicious you can go to Google Images and do a reverse image search by clicking on the camera icon and dragging in your picture. An example of an obvious fake, that many will have seen and that recurs, is the shark swimming up a flooded street.Again if a story is surprising, look at other news sources to see if they’re covering it too. If they’re not, that could give you some pause for thought. Stories on Google news have the option for ‘full coverage,’ which means you can see how others are reporting the same story.We have something called the Fact Check Explorer which allows you to type in a search term and then it shows you counterclaims and debunks of that theory by fact checking organisations.Google Maps, Google Earth and Street View can all help you verify whether an image that you are seeing is from the reported location. This can be done by checking for shadows of, for example, mountains or nearby buildings on Street View, and by matching them up with Google Earth.There are some amazing and painstaking examples of work from BBC Africa Eye with video verification. It shows that by combining digital tools with great journalism, you can get to the heart of what’s really going on.",
            "How are you tackling deep fakes?",
            "Technology evolves fast, but our engineering teams and trust and safety teams are working hard to make sure that our technology stays ahead of emerging threats, and we’re working closely with industry partners too to understand how they’re engaging with verification and misinformation. It’s an industry-wide effort.Progress is being made, for example YouTube has something called Content ID which allows organisations to detect their IP copyright and content.",
            "How does Google make sure that organisations don’t game the algorithm?",
            "We update the search algorithm thousands of times a year and work hard to make sure that the information people find is the most accurate, authoritative and relevant to what they’re looking for. We have policies in place to prevent spam and any deceptive practices — there’s more information here about how Search works. And I’d also add that we place a lot of importance on people finding good quality local news from reliable sources as well.",
            "How do you make sure that search literacy isn’t confined to the few and privileged?",
            "Over the last few years we’ve spent a lot of time with media literacy experts to provide newsroom style lessons for primary and secondary school students across the UK, a good example is Be Internet Legends which has reached over 70% of primary schools in England.And there’s more that can be done outside the classroom. Last year, we contributed €25 million to the European Media and Information Fund, which supports funding for publishers, academics and researchers to research and implement media literacy.",
            "What excites you about Search?",
            "One of the things that my team works with is a tool called Google Trends, which shows you anonymised, indexed data on what people are searching for across a given location or a given time.We collaborate with broadcasters, journalists, academics and non-profits to see what emerging patterns and trends in search reveal. What’s really interesting is how changing questions reveal changing attitudes across time. It’s useful for journalists, or indeed anybody who’s interested, to see what preoccupations people have around major news events.For example, if you're looking for the latest design trends, we can see that Search interest for 'japandi interior design' has increased by 973% in the last 12 months. Similarly, if you're wondering what people in the UK are reading, we can share that between 2017 and 2021, Search interest for books on neurodiversity has increased by 1280%.",
            "What’s your most loved search feature that everybody should know about?",
            "Some of the more Advanced Search features can really save time. So if you’re searching for information about an institution or a public figure, often you’ll have to wade through lots of information. If you want to delve deeper you can start to remove repetitive information, simply by putting a minus symbol in front of a word. For example, I travel a lot for work so if you’re looking for information about UK airports but you don’t want to focus on Heathrow you can type in ‘UK airports -Heathrow.’ It is simple, but saves lots of time!On Google Street View, my favourite desktop tool is the little clock at the top of the screen. This allows you to go back in time so you can see how things have changed. For example, when Britain was getting ready to host the 2012 Olympic Games, you can see all the flags and banners up in central London. And where cities change fast, for example East London, you can see how new developments have taken the place of old buildings. Take a look!"

And to help you answer those questions, we’ve got plenty of travel-related Google trends that can guide you through settling on your next journey.",
            "Who should go on the trip with you?So far in 2022, search interest in “girls trip destinations” is up 300% and “good bachelor party ideas” is up 200%, so group trips are certainly on our minds. Expecting parents would be wise to take one last couples trip — in fact, in the U.S., search interest in “best babymoon destinations usa” increased 170% in the first four months of 2022. And there’s nothing wrong with going solo; look no further than the 600% spike in “singles cruises” from January through April 2022.What’s the goal of your getaway?Once you’ve settled on who you want to travel with, the real fun can start and you can decide what kind of trip this will be. Well…is this a trip, or a vacation? Do you want to rest up, or rev up? Are you treating yourself or trying new adventures? Or maybe a little of all the above!According to Google Trends, lots of people are looking to experience the outdoors: The top-searched summer attractions in the U.S. include Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, as well as Lake Tahoe and the Grand Canyon.Glamping is also a popular option for those who want to get outside without totally roughing it (that’s glamorous camping, for the uninitiated). From January 2019 to April 2022, search interest in “glamping near me” spiked more than 500%. Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Tennessee are the most-searched destinations for glamping.Where should you go?Whatever kind of traveler you are (or plan to become this summer!), landing on the right destination is key. And if you’re excited about an international adventure, you’re in great company! Search interest in “passport appointments” increased 300% over the first four months of 2022, and Google Flights trends show that five of the top 20 destinations people in the U.S. are searching for are in Europe — London, Paris, Rome, Athens and Lisbon.

So if you want to hit the trendy spots, you know where to go…and if you want to avoid the trendy spots, you know where not to go.Traveling isn’t stress-free, and for anyone who’s already feeling overwhelmed by the options, there’s nothing wrong with indulging in a staycation. In fact, looking at January through April 2022, “luxury hotels near me” has over two times the search interest it had during the same period in 2019. No passport required."

            "Ninety-six years ago on April 30th, one of the original highways in the U.S. Highway System was assigned its numerical designation of 66, creating what we know today as Route 66. But to say Route 66 is just a highway is a grave understatement. After all, it is the most-searched U.S. highway of all time.One of the perks of working as a Doodler (I promise, it’s a real job) was getting to drive the 2,448-mile journey from Chicago to Los Angeles in my ‘72 Chevelle. I got to experience this captivating road trip firsthand, to create a Doodle celebrating Route 66.This Doodle, which is essentially an animated sketchbook of various historic spots along the route, is the product of more than 100 paintings and sketches I created from the side of the road and countless U-turns. I remember being utterly lost one day, driving further and further down an old dirt road, when I finally saw an old man sitting on a lawn mower. “Is this Route 66?” I enquired. “Boy, this isn’t even Route 6!” he responded. Even the dead ends were interesting.",
            "If this Doodle has you feeling inspired to take a trip across Route 66, we also caught up with a member of Google Maps’ Local Guides community who has some tips of his own to help you hit the road and explore.Local tips from a Local GuideRhys Martin is a Level 6 Local Guide from Tulsa, Oklahoma who also serves as the President of the Oklahoma Route 66 Association. Having driven all 2,400 miles of the existing route, Rhys is passionate about adding photos and reviews to Google Maps that help raise awareness for the variety of experiences — from big cities and rural communities, to farmland, mountains, deserts, mom-and-pop motels and kitschy roadside attractions — a road trip down the historic highway provides. We asked him to share his best tips, tricks and recommendations to discover and experience his favorite spots along the route.Discover local businesses along the route: By searching for something like “U.S Route 66 Restaurants” on Google Maps you can virtually explore restaurants or other businesses across all eight states along the route. This way, you can familiarize yourself with attractions, view how much certain restaurants cost, read reviews and even see popular menu items to help you choose places you want to visit.Plan your road trip with Lists in Google Maps: Once you discover the places you’re interested in visiting, save them to a list that can serve as an itinerary so you can support local businesses — and help preserve history – along the route. You can even share your list with others, or make them collaborative so you can plan together!A picture is worth a thousand words: Photographing the details of a place — like the decades-old neon signage or the original menus hanging behind the counter — and sharing them through reviews on Google Maps helps capture the essence of an establishment and helps others discover places they want to visit.While Oklahoma has the most drivable miles of Route 66, Rhys says there’s so much to see in all eight states along the route. If you’re itching to plan the perfect summer road trip, check out a list of his must-see spots across Route 66 from Illinois to California."

            "Can you tell us a bit about how Google Trends works?What Google Trends does is take a sample of the searches people make on Google to figure out how high the search interest for a given keyword is at any given time — relative to the total amount of searches. For example, after the now infamous Will Smith Oscars incident, we saw searches for “Will Smith Oscars” increased by 500 times.We also make an educated guess about where the searches are coming from, and that’s how we are able to display a map of search interest in different places. We do this based on the data flowing through Google Search day in and day out — so we’re able to see the search interest from 2004 all the way up to just a few minutes ago. This is really helpful in understanding how the interest in different topics changes over time and in different places.A lot of researchers and journalists use Trends as sort of an anthropological tool to give them a view into what interests people in private, but may not be in the collective consciousness. For example, you can use Google Trends to help detect local disease outbreaks long before disease control centers detect them, simply by looking at where people were using Google to look up their symptoms.",

It can be surprising to see some of your own searches there. There were also a lot of cryptocurrency terms among the top trending searches — things like “ethereum” and “dogecoin.”",

We process a sample of the billions of searches that are made every day around the world, and the amount of daily searches just keeps on growing. We also have to be able to make all of this available to Trends users so that they can look up whatever keywords they want for any time and any place.It’s pretty crazy the amount of engineering work that has gone into making all this run smoothly over the years — the amount of data grows faster and faster because people are searching more on Google every year. It always amazes me that of the trillions of searches we see every year, 15% are brand new every day.",
            "Looking at Search as a whole, what direction do you see the product taking in the future? I can certainly talk about what I’d like to see. I love it when it feels like the technology just gets me and knows what I’d like to do next. For example, when searching for a TV show, Search brings up the cast because it just knows that it’s something I might instinctually be interested in.I’d like to see this mature into other areas. For example, Search could suggest related topics or other things I might be interested in based on my habits and what I just searched. Essentially anything that helps me to continue exploring my curiosities around a particular search I would love.So if I searched for “weekend hike” it would suggest “local wildlife field guide” and then “baby deer season” because it’s possible I might be interested in that without even knowing that I was. So for me, I’d love to see a continuation of timely, topical suggestions as you go."

            "Staying on top of your finances can be tricky and confusing. With a ton of information available, it’s tough to know where to start — or what information to trust — when it comes to managing your money and learning about finance.People come to Google to ask questions about a wide range of financial topics, from budgeting, home ownership and unemployment benefits to digital currencies and investment trends. April marks Financial Literacy Month, so here are some quick and easy ways Google can help you take stock of your money.Check the sourceSearch interest in “how to become a crypto millionaire” increased by 3,500% in the past year across the U.S. There’s a lot of buzz about ways to make money and new investment options, and it can be difficult to decide what information is trustworthy. If you’re looking into a new digital currency, searching for investment tips, or just want some peace of mind about financial topics, it’s important to get information from a reliable source. With the About This Result feature on Google Search, you can quickly and easily learn about sources to get a sense of how they describe themselves, and how other people on the web describe them. You can also get additional context about the topic you’re looking up, like top news coverage, to see what a wide range of sources have to say.",
            "Balance your budgetIn the last year, many of our top “how to” money questions on Search were asking how to do important life tasks — like eat healthy, plan a wedding or travel — on a budget. One of the best places to start is by looking at how much you’re spending. Google Sheets can be a great tool for recording your monthly expenses, income and investments, and more to understand your financial footprint. You can start from scratch on a Sheet or use templates to do things like build your budget from the ground up, manage a financial to-do list and track your finances.Take it one step further by using the Google Pay app to track your spending in real time. You can see your spending by category or business. For example, if you search for “food,” you will see a list of all your transactions related to food. You can get even more specific, for example searching for “juice” or for a specific business like your favorite juice or smoothie bar. You can also quickly see which bills you have coming up and keep track of all your recurring subscriptions, to help you trim your expenses for that dream vacation. Google Pay also lets you pull receipts from your Gmail or Google Photos accounts, keeping all your finances organized in one place.",

            "Joe Impressions is a graphic designer based in Nairobi, Kenya. In honor of what would have been the 71st birthday of the late professor Okoth Okombo of Nairobi University, Joe served as a local guest artist to create a Google Doodle reflecting Professor Okombo’s contribution and legacy that launched on November 8, 2021. Professor Okombo was one of the founders of the scientific study of sign language in Africa and a distinguished scholar in Nilotic language study. Here, we speak to Joe about using Search in his design process and how curiosity fuels how he works.",
            "Thanks for chatting with us, Joe. So, how does one go from doodling for fun to being a Google Doodle guest artist?",
            "Curiosity has driven my whole creative journey. I grew up doodling Bible stories for children back at home as a child. In high school, I began secretly doodling on the back pages of my school books. That's when I discovered my love for art, so I enjoyed using my free time to doodle for fun.Afterwards, I went to university and studied a non-art-related course. My mother bought me my first laptop which spurred my interest in creating digital art. This curiosity led me to discover computer software that enabled me to create my own art. Midway, I was tempted to switch courses and study art, but I chose not to. Instead, I decided to utilize my free time every day to practice and learn how to use software such as Adobe Illustrator through online tutorials.After graduation, I had greatly improved my skills, but then the COVID pandemic started. I went back home and since there wasn't much going on, I had a lot of free time. As remote working became a thing, I slowly started to get freelance jobs and clients from freelance platforms. This gave me valuable experience working with clients on actual real-life projects.Over time, my online portfolio on Behance (a social media platform for designers) grew, and eventually people noticed me and my work. I was honored when Google approached me to create a Doodle for Professor Okoth Okombo's 71st birthday. This still motivates me to keep moving forward and find new opportunities to expand my skills.",
            "You spoke about ‘curiosity being your guide’ in the creative process. What was your starting point with creating this Doodle?",
            "I start my creative process long before I begin the drawing bit. I am always curiously observing and absorbing the people, art, and world around me to ignite my creativity. As I walk, travel, or dream, I am always ready to be inspired.Once I have been inspired, I begin the research phase. I begin my research by brainstorming keywords derived from my imagination and feelings. I like to list down keywords and ideas that are easy to search for on Google, such as \"lecturer\" and \"student.\" Next, I Google Searched the internet for relevant photographs, images, paintings and illustrations in order to get a realistic setting in perspective and composition. Additionally, looking at previous Doodles by other artists helped me form my general expectations. Having a rough idea of­ what I would like to search for before starting research helps me stay focused.Having done all this, I felt comfortable to start the sketching phase. I came up with three rough sketches to present to Google for feedback. We selected the best concept based on the feedback. The next step was to refine the sketch into accurate outlines. I usually make my outlines look organic and hand-drawn by varying the stroke width using custom brushes in Adobe Illustrator.The final stage is the coloring and rendering stage. The colors for this Doodle are inspired by the Kenyan Flag (black, red, green, and white). I save hundreds of nice images that I come across so that I can reference their colors later. I do this to enlarge the library of colors that I use in my work.",
            "How do you use Search in your day-to-day life in Kenya? For information, escapism or something else?",
            "Throughout my journey, Search has been like a giant key that I use to unlock doors of information. Every day, Search makes it effortless to access a vast amount of information for free. I started out illustrating by searching for art tutorials on my phone and laptop using school Wi-Fi. Many college and university students are dependent on search to complete assignments and do research.These days, I use Search more than ever. I search daily for everything, like resources, entertainment, and ways to connect with others and keep myself informed. With the current increasing internet penetration rate, the search continues to provide young Kenyan creatives with resources that could have been inaccessible before. Search is contributing to the rising access to online jobs as the source of work opportunities is shifting to digital platforms.",
            "Any advice for aspiring Doodle artists out there?",
            "The best way for aspiring Doodle artists to improve their craft is to stay inspired, be consistent, and do lots of practice. The creative process is often cloudy, filled with doubts and revisions. Keep hunting down those elusive ideas every day. You will eventually find them, and people will start to notice you and your work.Don’t let insufficient resources stop you from following your dreams. Use everything you have at your disposal to learn, and it will pay off in the long run.",
            "What does the Google Doodle mean to you?",
            "This Doodle gave me a massive chance to fuse my illustration skills, former university experiences, and the inspiration that I got from other Google Doodles. All my previous interactions with other Doodles left me with a piece of information that I did not know before. It was my moment to celebrate Professor Okoth Okombo by showing my vision of what I imagined Professor Okoth Okombo’s lectures would feel like.Moreover, my mom, now a lecturer, was once Professor Okoth Okombo's student at the University of Nairobi. That makes this Doodle very meaningful to me."

            "When the weather changes, so do our fashion preferences. Out with the sweaters and flannel, in with the swimsuits and florals — to celebrate the closet switch-up, we’re sharing some interesting fashion trends and queries from Google Shopping. For starters, people are looking to history for inspiration: The most-searched fashion trends over the past 30 days in the U.S. are “80s fashion,” followed by “90s fashion,” “y2k fashion,” “2000s fashion” and “70s fashion.”If you’re not ready for your closet to go back in time, there are a few other springtime-related search trends that might fit a bit better (pun intended) — starting with florals. (We know, we know: groundbreaking.)“Sunflower bathing suit” is a breakout search over the past 30 days in the U.S., as is “floral handbag,” which saw a +140% spike over the same period of time. Nail art search trends included the phrases “sunflower,” “daisy,” “summer” and “spring,” as well.",
            "And while it’s not a floral per se, the color green — which is definitely garden adjacent — is also having a moment: “Green glitter nails” spiked more than 130% over the past 30 days in the U.S. “Green Prada shoes” saw nearly the same rise (+100%) within the last month, too. Green was also the most-searched nail polish color, and the second-most popular color in searches for handbags after black. Which obviously raises the question: Is green the new black!? Keep an eye on spring fashion to find out."

            "People shop across Google more than a billion times a day — and we have a pretty good sense of what they’re browsing for. For instance, our Search data shows that the early 2000’s are having a moment. We’re seeing increased search interest in “Y2k fashion” and products like bucket hats and ankle bracelets. Also popular? The iconic Clinique “Happy” perfume, Prada crochet bags and linen pants.While we know what’s trending, we also wanted to understand how people find inspiration when they’re shopping for lifestyle products. So we surveyed 2,000 U.S. shoppers of apparel, beauty and home decor for our first Inspired Shopping Report. Read on to find out what we learned.",
            "Shopping isn’t always a checklistAccording to our findings, most fashion, beauty and home shoppers spend up to two weeks researching products before they buy them. Many, though, are shopping online just for fun — 65% say they often or sometimes shop or browse online when they’re not looking for anything in particular. To help make online shopping even easier and more entertaining, we recently added more browsable search results for fashion and apparel shopping queries. So when you search for chunky loafers, a lime green dress or a raffia bag on Google, you’ll scroll through a visual feed with various colors and styles — alongside other helpful information like local shops, style guides and videos.",
            "Inspiration can strike anywhereWe know shopping inspiration can strike at any moment. In fact, 60% of shoppers say they often or sometimes get inspired or prompted to buy something even when they aren’t actively shopping. That can come from spotting great street style: 39% of shoppers say they often or sometimes look for a specific outfit online after they see someone wearing it. Or it can come from browsing online: 48% of shoppers have taken a screenshot of a piece of clothing, accessory or home decor item they liked (and 70% of them say they’ve searched for or bought it afterwards). Google Lens can help you shop for looks as soon as you spot them. Just snap a photo or screenshot and you’ll find exact or similar results to shop from.",
            "Sometimes words aren’t enoughWe know it can be hard to find what you’re looking for using words alone, even when you do have an image — like that multi-colored, metallic floral wallpaper you took a photo of that would go perfectly with your living room rug. Half of shoppers say they often or sometimes have failed to find a specific piece of clothing or furniture online after trying to describe it with just words. And 66% of shoppers wished they could find an item in a different color or print.To help you track down those super specific pieces, we’re introducing an entirely new way to search — using text and images at the same time. With multisearch on Lens, you can better uncover the products you’re looking for even when you don’t have all the words to describe them. For example, you might be on the lookout for a scarf in the same pattern as one of your handbags. Just snap a photo of the patterned handbag on Lens and add the query “scarf” to complete your look. Or take a photo of your favorite heels and add the query “flats” to find a more comfortable version.",
            "Trying before you buy mattersIt’s not always possible to make it to the store and try something on before you buy it — but it matters. Among online beauty shoppers, more than 60% have decided not to purchase a beauty or cosmetic item online because they didn’t know what color or shade to choose, and 41% have decided to return an item because it was the wrong shade. With AR Beauty experiences, you can virtually discover and “try on” thousands of products from brands like Maybelline New York, M.A.C. and Charlotte Tilbury — helping you make more informed decisions. And now, shoppers can try on cosmetics from a variety of brands carried at Ulta Beauty right in Google Search. Just search for a product, like the Morphe Matte Liquid Lipstick or Kylie Cosmetics High Gloss, and find the best shade for you.",

            "Every day, people come to Google looking for ways to keep themselves and their families safe. From highlighting resources in the wake of a natural disaster to providing time-sensitive health information, we’re constantly working on new features and improvements to help you quickly find what you need. And advancements in AI can power new technologies, like flood forecasting, to help people stay out of harm’s way.Here’s a look at how our AI systems are helping us connect people to critical information while avoiding potentially shocking or harmful content — so you can stay safe, both online and off.",
            "Finding trustworthy, actionable information when you need it mostWe know that people come to Search in the moments that matter most. Today, if you search on Google for information on suicide, sexual assault, substance abuse and domestic violence, you’ll see contact information for national hotlines alongside the most relevant and helpful results.But people in personal crises search in all kinds of ways, and it’s not always obvious to us that they’re in need. And if we can’t accurately recognize that, we can’t code our systems to show the most helpful search results. That's why using machine learning to understand language is so important.Now, using our latest AI model, MUM, we can automatically and more accurately detect a wider range of personal crisis searches. MUM can better understand the intent behind people’s questions to detect when a person is in need, which helps us more reliably show trustworthy and actionable information at the right time. We’ll start using MUM to make these improvements in the coming weeks.",
            "Steering clear of unexpected shocking contentKeeping you safe on Search also means helping you steer clear of unexpected shocking results. This can be challenging, because content creators sometimes use benign terms to label explicit or suggestive content. And the most prevalent content that matches your search may not be what you intended to find. In these cases, even if people aren't directly seeking explicit content, it can show up in their results.One way we tackle this is with SafeSearch mode, which offers users the option to filter explicit results. This setting is on by default for Google accounts for people under 18. And even when users choose to have SafeSearch off, our systems still reduce unwanted racy results for searches that aren't seeking them out. In fact, every day, our safety algorithms improve hundreds of millions of searches globally across web, image and video modes.But there’s still room for improvement, and we’re using advanced AI technologies like BERT to better understand what you’re looking for. BERT has improved our understanding of whether searches are truly seeking out explicit content, helping us vastly reduce your chances of encountering surprising search results.This is a complex challenge we’ve been tackling for a while — but in the last year alone, this BERT improvement has reduced unexpected shocking results by 30%. It’s been especially effective in reducing explicit content for searches related to ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender, which can disproportionately impact women and especially women of color.",
            "Scaling our protections around the worldMUM can transfer knowledge across the 75 languages it’s trained on, which can help us scale safety protections around the world much more efficiently. When we train one MUM model to perform a task — like classifying the nature of a query — it learns to do it in all the languages it knows.For example, we use AI to reduce unhelpful and sometimes dangerous spam pages in your search results. In the coming months, we’ll use MUM to improve the quality of our spam protections and expand to languages where we have very little training data. We'll also be able to better detect personal crisis queries all over the world, working with trusted local partners to show actionable information in several more countries.Like any improvement to Search, these changes have and will continue to go through rigorous evaluation — with input from our search raters around the world to make sure we’re providing more relevant, helpful results. Whatever you’re searching for, we’re committed to helping you safely find it."

            "My years spent caring for patients at the bedside and in the clinic inspired me to find ways to improve health for them and their communities at scale. That passion eventually brought me to Google where I could help solve the world’s most significant health challenges.I joined the company just weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded. At the time, most people hadn’t heard of “flattening the curve” or “mRNA vaccines.” But what they did know was that they could turn to Google with their questions. The COVID-19 pandemic strengthened our resolve that Google could and should help everyone, everywhere live a healthier life. It also accelerated our company-wide health efforts.We embed health into our products to meet people where they are. Our teams apply their expertise and technological strengths and harness the power of partnerships to support our 3Cs – consumers, caregivers and communities around the world.Today, we’re hosting our second annual Google Health event, The Check Up. Teams from across the company — including Search, YouTube, Fitbit, Care Studio, Health AI, Cloud and Advanced Technologies and Projects team — will share updates about their latest efforts.Among the areas of progress, I’m delighted at the ways our teams are working to support consumers with helpful information and tools throughout their health journeys.",

In the past year, YouTube has focused on building partnerships with leading health organizations and public health leaders to increase the volume and visibility of authoritative health content through new features.Starting this week in Japan, Brazil and India, YouTube is adding health source information panels on videos to provide context that helps viewers identify videos from authoritative sources, and health content shelves that more effectively highlight videos from these sources when people search for specific health topics. These context cues help people easily navigate and evaluate credible health information.",

Fitbit makes it easy and motivating for people to manage their holistic health, from activity and nutrition to sleep and mindfulness. Fitbit co-founder James Park shared how Fitbit believes wearables can have an even greater impact on supporting people with chronic conditions, including heart conditions like atrial fibrillation (AFib).In 2020, the team launched the Fitbit Heart Study, with nearly half a million people who use Fitbit. The goal was to test our PPG (Photoplethysmography) AFib algorithm, which passively looks at heart rate data, to alert people to signs of an irregular heart rhythm.We presented the study results at the most recent American Heart Association meeting, showing that the algorithm accurately identified undiagnosed AFib 98% of the time. We’ve submitted our algorithm to the FDA for review. This is one of many ways we’re continuing to make health even more accessible.",

            "“The only way to truly educate ourselves is to ask questions. Questions that sometimes aren’t comfortable,” says Marcus Rashford, a hero to so many, and the person who spearheads our #ItsOktoAsk campaign here in the UK.The campaign encourages us to be unafraid to ask the questions closest to our hearts. The questions that can help us to better understand one another and bring us closer together. Post pandemic, many have been taking stock of what’s important, re-evaluating relationships and considering career changes. We partnered with YouGov to find out more about what people were seeking to understand, but were hesitant to ask friends and family. The search data revealed some fascinating results:64% of UK adults say being able to ask questions without judgment makes it easier to ask a search engine like Google first, specifically on questions that define societal norms.50% of UK adults say the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns led them to re-evaluate friendships, relationships, family and work.Friendships – calling time and setting boundariesBoth YouGov and Google Search Trends data shows that we’re thinking carefully about who we want to spend time with, with YouGov research indicating that 44% of UK adults are actively seeking new friendships, 46% want to end negative or non-useful friendships and 42% are looking to set more boundaries around their time.Many of us are evaluating our networks, with one in 10 UK adults turning to Google to ask “How to make a more ethnically or gender diverse friendship group'' according to YouGov, and the same number questioning the gender of their friends, for example whether it’s “OK to have only male or female friends.”Tellingly, we see Google trending searches over the last year including questions such as, “How can I make friends?” and “Is it normal to not have any friends?”Romance and relationshipsWith IRL dating back on the cards, many UK adults are re-circling previous debates such as who pays the bill, which was a breakout search over the last year. Other trending searches were, “Is it OK to date two guys at the same time?” alongside, “Is it normal to want an open relationship?”For 31% of those surveyed aged 45-54 looking for a fresh start after a relationship, correlating Google searches for “Should I split up with my partner?” and “When should I date again after a breakup?” saw a spike at the beginning of the year.Many in relationships are reconsidering what that means, with searches like, “How to tell my boyfriend I’m polyamorous” and “How to meet polyamorous couples” spiking over the last year.Other trending questions over the last two years using Google Search reveal our very human vulnerabilities:“Is it OK to be single?”“How long after a date should I text?”“Is it OK to have sex on a first date?”“Is it OK for woman to be taller than man?”“Is it OK to split the bill on a date?”Parenting – whether to and how toPeople are questioning what parenthood looks like as we enter 2022, with a surge in searches for “How do you know if you want children?” and “Is it OK to not want children?” over the past year.We are also turning to Google Search for parenting advice. Questions that have spiked over the last year show it’s been a preoccupation, and unsurprisingly given the circumstances for many parents. They included:“How to be the best dad”“How to be the best mum”“How to balance being a mum and working”“How to work full time and be a single mum”“I always doubt my parenting abilities”“How does society affect child rearing?”Work life shake upsGoogle Trends shows that 23% of searches indicate that many people want to make big lifestyle changes when it comes to their work-life balance. Searches spiked around terms such as “How to make extra money from home” and “Flexible work from home jobs.”Many are also looking into creative vocations, with increases in searches over the last year including:“Film director courses”“Interior design apprenticeship”“DJing course”“Sign language courses”Jewellery making course UK”More than ever before, women are looking to support each other in the workplace too, with Google Search interest in female mentorship increasing by 130% in the past 12 months in the UK — more than any other European country during this time. Peer mentoring for women was also on the rise, spiking by 250% in the UK in the past 12 months compared to the previous year. We’ve reason to be proud here.What will you be searching for to improve your conversations and understanding about life and relationships?"

            "People search on Google billions of times every day. Our Search systems are designed to sort through all the information that could be a good match, and we’re always updating our ranking systems to make sure they’re working well.Sometimes the improvements we make are broad and affect all types of queries. Others are more specialized, designed to improve results for more specific searches and the types of information we know people like to see.Take product reviews, for instance. We know people appreciate reviews that share in-depth research, rather than simply summarize a bunch of products. That’s why over the past year, we’ve been working to improve the product reviews we display in Search, with the latest update launching today.Our first updates were designed to, among other things, help ensure reviews come from people who demonstrate expert knowledge and first-hand research about products. Today’s update builds on this work to make sure that product reviews in Search meet certain criteria, such as:Include helpful in-depth details, like the benefits or drawbacks of a certain item, specifics on how a product performs or how the product differs from previous versionsCome from people who have actually used the products, and show what the product is physically like or how it’s usedInclude unique information beyond what the manufacturer provides — like visuals, audio or links to other content detailing the reviewer’s experienceCover comparable products, or explain what sets a product apart from its competitorsOur work to improve product reviews will continue, including expanding these updates to more languages beyond English. Ultimately, our goal is to help people find trustworthy, reliable advice when they come to Search — no matter what they’re looking for.For those who create reviews on the web, check out our tips for writing high quality product reviews."

            "Danny Sullivan is Google’s Public Liaison for Search — meaning he explains the ins and outs of Search to the world, and tells the people who work on Search what the world is saying about it. On an average day, you might find Danny answering questions on Twitter, giving a presentation at an event or responding to feedback somewhere on the web. You might also find him at a Star Trek convention, but that’s a story for another day 🖖.Before Danny became our Search Liaison in 2017, he followed the world of search engines for more than two decades, and was one of the leading experts on the subject. In fact, it’s been 25 years since he launched one of the earliest online publications about search engine marketing. To celebrate this milestone, we talked to Danny about how he’s seen search engines evolve over the years, from both inside and outside of Google.How did you get interested in search technology?When I was in college, my idea of fun was to use our library search system, “Melvyl,” to see all the books that matched words like “history” or “science.” The searches would crash because there were so many results. But finding books digitally, rather than flipping through a card catalog, was amazing at the time. Later as a journalist, I had to craft intricate queries on LexisNexis to locate past articles. It could be a lot of work, but it was still exciting to see how tech made it easier to find useful material.By the time the internet and early search engines arrived, I was still captivated with search — only now it was possible to find content from anywhere in the world and get results within seconds, without formal search commands. It blew my mind, and I never got over that sense of awe. I’m still fascinated by search and the power it gives anyone to find information quickly and learn more about anything you dream up.How have you seen people's perceptions of search engines change over time?In the 1990s, I taught classes on search. Search engines weren’t always good at handling natural language queries, and learning special search commands could sometimes produce better results. People often felt it was their fault, rather than the search engine’s, if they didn’t find what they were looking for.Today, it feels like people are born knowing how to search. You just type what you want into a magic box, and poof! It delivers results — no classes needed. It also feels like people are less likely to blame themselves if they don’t find what they’re looking for. Perhaps it’s because search has become so advanced that people’s tendencies have changed. It’s so much easier to find what you need that people have developed higher (and well-justified!) expectations.People may not always remember the many times Google gets them exactly what they’re looking for, but they may notice the outliers — the times we don’t get it right. At Google, we see this as a positive. It suggests we've built and earned a reputation for delivering what people want, and we strive to do just that.What do you wish more people knew about Google Search?I don’t think most people realize how much work goes into regularly improving Search. We make thousands of improvements throughout the year — more than 5,000 in 2021 alone.Once we’ve decided on a change, we carefully evaluate it with quantitative feedback from live experiments and qualitative feedback from our human reviewers. If everything looks good, we ship it. For example, today we’re updating how we rank product reviews in Search to prioritize in-depth, first-person content.Last year, we conducted more than 800,000 experiments and ongoing quality tests to make sure the results we deliver — and changes we launch — actually make Search more useful for people. And we feel pretty confident this process is working. Over the last seven years, our internal metrics based on quality rater data show we’ve decreased the number of irrelevant results by over 50%.",
            "How have you seen Google Search evolve over the years?Search has evolved along with the web and the way people access Search. There are more types of information — from AR to images and videos — and more features to help people find what they need, in the rich visual formats they want.We’ve even introduced more ways to search, like searching visually with Google Lens. The other day on a hike, I saw an insect on a flower, pointed Lens at it and it quickly identified the type of bee it was. I never could have imagined this when Search was just starting out.A less obvious way Search has evolved is in its understanding of what people are looking for. In 2019, we launched BERT, a neural network-based ranking improvement that can better understand natural language and longer queries. Interestingly, as we’ve used AI to improve our understanding of language over the years, we’ve seen people’s Search queries evolve, too. Since 2015, we’ve seen a more than 60% increase in natural language queries in Search. This means people can find what they need more easily, and using language that’s closer to the way we normally write and speak.What’s next for Search?Our deep understanding of information and the world around us — made possible by advancements in AI — is helping us reimagine what it means to “search.” Soon, you’ll be able to search with images and text simultaneously using Google Lens, helping you learn about the physical world and ask questions about what you see in a more intuitive way.I’m also really excited about how we can help people with all those questions that don’t have a single answer. Google’s great at finding answers to simple questions — but we also want to help people more easily navigate topics they’re not familiar with, or if they don’t even know where to start.After more than two decades thinking about Search, what’s most exciting to me is that it’s never a solved problem. We’ve only started to scratch the surface of how Google can help make information accessible and useful."

            "March is synonymous with college basketball. Though my basketball career peaked in middle school, I still find myself cheering for the underdog and watching replays of buzzer beaters night after night. As college basketball heats up, we’ll fill out our brackets (I’m partial to Carolina Blue!), and follow along to the latest women’s and men’s games. Here are some ways to use Search to keep up with your favorite teams and athletes, and catch the best plays from all 100+ games across the tournaments.Stats leaderboard, trends additionAcross Search we are seeing that people can’t wait for the games to tip off. Search interest in the United States for “when does march madness start” increased +1,700% in the past month. But with bragging rights on the line, people are also searching for “Bracketology,” which has been a breakout search topic all throughout the regular season in the US. In the spirit of friendly competition, we’ve decided to share ours with you, because who needs a high NET ranking when you have search interest to help pick a winner?",
            "Keeping up with every play on SearchNow, if it's hard for you to catch every game or maybe you just need an excuse to relive every play, you can do just that. We partnered with Turner Sports, CBS and the NCAA to help you tune-in live with March Madness Live and bring you in-game highlights and post-game recaps, all accessible through Search. Simply look up or click on a specific game and you will have access to real-time content, ensuring you don’t miss a single moment of nail-biting basketball.",
            "Understanding which team you meanAnd with so many great women’s and men’s teams to keep track of, Search tries to understand what you’re looking for. When you come to find sports information for your favorite professional team, it's easy to just search for them by name. But with college sports, women's and men's teams often share the same name. Simply searching for a school name plus the word \"basketball\" doesn't necessarily specify a league. And if you want to find information for a women's game and only see men's game times or scores, that's not a great experience.That’s why, just in time for the tournament, we’re rolling out an improvement to how we understand sports searches and showcase team information in Search. Now, when you search for your favorite college basketball team, we’ll take into account different factors like trending searches and even game times to help us better understand which team you’re searching for.Even with these improvements, what Search predicts as likely the most relevant game or team may not be quite what you wanted. But you shouldn't have to do yet another search to ask to see women's or men's scores. So we're adding a carousel with the same kind of information for the other team.",

Listening to their stories has challenged me to identify blind spots in our design process and make sure the features we build have real-world impact. For example, we know that timely access to different communication modes is essential, so we prioritized the simplicity and visibility of phone, chat and text services when designing our hotline features.How do the skills you learned in ER translate to your current job?In the emergency room — much like with crisis hotlines — you never know who will walk through the door or what their situation will be. In this environment — where time is of the essence — the ability to solve problems outside of your comfort zone, work together as a team, and be agile can save lives.

            "Woman to woman, what’s the best career advice you’ve gotten?Women in tech often avoid talking about feelings for fear of coming across as “too emotional.” So, I really appreciated it when a female mentor helped me flip that narrative. Feelings are just another data point, and if you pay attention they can reveal a lot. Feelings alone don’t give you much information, but if you take the time to ask yourself, “Why am I feeling funny about this?” you can figure out if something going on is not aligned with your values, priorities or goals. Then you can then shift from the feelings space to the logic space to figure out what to do about it.What impactful things are you working on with Street View?Street View is immensely valuable for getting a sense of a new place before you visit — whether for vibe, navigation or safety. Understanding what to expect when you go somewhere new can give anyone more comfort as they get things done.

            "Every February, I tell myself I’m going to make homemade Valentine’s Day cards for my family and friends…and every February 13, I realize I’m nearly out of time. Add the fact that these days it’s ultimately easier to deliver digital gifts, and I’m ready to give up on the whole thing.This year I’ve come up with a few new ideas, courtesy of apps and tools from Google. They might be made for the office or school, but there are some truly impressive ways you can use these apps for your creative endeavors. Here are five ways you can make Valentines with Google products.Use Google Sheets to make some lovely pixel art (emphasis on love). You might think of invoices and project tracking when you think of Google Sheets, but it can also be a pixel art palette. These can be as simple or as complex as you want — do it yourself by selecting and coloring in Sheets cells to make an image, or search the Google Workspace Marketplace by hitting the right-hand sidebar and selecting “add ons.” (If words are more your thing, you could even try making a cute crossword puzzle.)",
            "2. Create a digital card with Google Slides. This is an especially useful option if you aren’t able to see someone on Valentine’s Day. Make a digital slideshow full of photos, videos and notes; then you can either send the file or publish it to the web.3. Set up a shared library with Google Photos. Use partner sharing in Google Photos to create a shared library of photos and videos for you and your better half. You can choose if you want to share all your photos or just shots of specific loved ones or pets, as well as the date you want to start sharing and Google Photos will automatically take care of the rest.4. Send a fun Google Form to your partner. More than a couple of Google Forms used for dating purposes have gone viral, and you can put your own spin on one for the big day. Be sure to check out the Template gallery to find a look you like, or add your own images and choose a different font to make your form stand out.",
            "5. Reminisce on romantic trips with Google Maps. Feeling nostalgic? Take a walk down memory lane with the Trips tab in Timeline to see all of the places — from beaches to cute cafes - that you visited on your last vacay.6. Get some material from Google Assistant. Ask Google Assistant how to say “I love you” in another language, or ask for a Valentine’s Day joke or a “fact about love” to impress someone.Or maybe you’re more interested in watching a few rom-coms on February 14. According to Google Trends, the most-searched types of romantic movies in the U.S. since 2004 are:Teen romance moviesBlack romance moviesRomance comedy moviesSad romance moviesChristmas romance moviesYou could take some inspiration from a few of Google Search’s trending Valentine’s Day terms from the past week — like “chick fil a valentines day tray” (+1,650%), “valentine lovebirds lego” (+600%) or “valentines crocs” (+400%). A few more breakout terms from the past month include: “valentines converse,” “starbucks valentines 2022,” “valentines coloring pages” and “nike valentines day shoes 2022.”And if you’re still not quite sure how to celebrate, there’s one fail-safe option: chocolate. According to Google Trends, Godiva just barely took the lead over Ghiradelli in search interest in the U.S. this past week.",
            "Also in the U.S., Google Maps searches for flower shops spike nearly 120% leading up to February 14. And if you’re thinking about celebrating with a date night…maybe start planning early: In the U.S., February 13 marks the day people most use Google Maps to search for “romantic restaurants.”"

            "Lots of people quit in 2021. Like, a lot. Month after month, a record number of people put their tools away, shut their laptops, took off their badges, handed in their two week’s notice or simply walked out the door and didn’t go back.We were curious — what did people leave their jobs to do next? What careers piqued their interest, what training programs did they pursue? We looked at Google Search trends to get an idea.The first thing we noticed was how global this experience has been. The “Great Resignation” of 2021 is usually talked about as an American phenomenon, but Search trends suggest that people everywhere were looking to leave their jobs. The top countries searching for “how to leave your job” come from five different continents: The Philippines is at the top, followed by South Africa, then the U.S., Australia and the U.K.Search trends also reveal what career paths people are interested in. To find this out, we looked at the jobs people searched for alongside the phrase “how to become,” such as “how to become an astronaut.” Trends showed us that over the past year, people were most interested in jobs that involve helping others, travel and working in real estate — ideally in a role that doesn’t require a traditional boss. .Most-searched “how to become” jobs — January 2021-January 2022Real estate agentFlight attendantNotaryTherapistPilotFirefighterPersonal trainerPsychiatristPhysical therapistElectricianWhen drilling down to look at the most-searched “how to become…” jobs in each U.S. state, there were some distinct regional trends. People in the South and Midwest were interested in becoming a notary (with the exception of several Appalachian states). Large portions of the Northeast, Northern Midwest and Western U.S. were interested in real estate careers.Notably, only two states’ most-searched jobs did not include notary, real estate agent, electrician or pilot: New Mexico, where people were most interested in becoming a flight attendant, and Montana, where people sought information about personal training over any other profession.",
            "We also looked at Search trends related to professional certifications and training programs. Similar to the “how to become” trends, these showed that people are interested in real estate. We also learned that people are interested in jobs involving hair and beauty, medical assisting and data analytics.Top trending professional certifications and training programs in the U.S. — January 2021-January 2022Google data analytics professional certificateNCMA certificationChild development associate certificationEyelash technician training programElectrician training programReal estate training programBarber training programFinding a new job on SearchIf you’re one of the many people who left their job in recent months, here are some tips for finding your next gig on Search:Search for any job and a dedicated section will appear with opportunities from employers and job boards across the web. Use filters to sort by title, location, date posted and more.Customize your job search to your experience level, or to the benefits or job environment you want. Try searching “WFH jobs” or “no experience jobs near me.”See jobs specific to your educational background by adding your field of study to your job search, such as “jobs for history majors.” And try “no degree jobs” to see opportunities that don’t require a bachelor’s.Keep a lookout for the “Actively Hiring\" filter that shows jobs from employers that are hiring a lot right now.Save jobs you want to come back to by tapping the bookmark icon on any posting. Find jobs you’ve saved in the “Saved” tab of the job search tool on the web, or in the Collections tab of the Google app on iOS and Android.",

            "Do you ever wonder how Google understands what you’re looking for? There’s a lot that goes into delivering helpful search results, and understanding language is one of the most important skills. Thanks to advancements in AI and machine learning, our Search systems are understanding human language better than ever before. And we want to share a behind-the-scenes look at how this translates into relevant results for you.But first, let's walk down memory lane: In the early days of Search, before we had advanced AI, our systems simply looked for matching words. For example, if you searched for “pziza” — unless there was a page with that particular misspelling, you’d likely have to redo the search with the correct spelling to find a slice near you. And eventually, we learned how to code algorithms to find classes of patterns, like popular misspellings or potential typos from neighboring keys. Now, with advanced machine learning, our systems can more intuitively recognize if a word doesn’t look right and suggest a possible correction.These kinds of AI improvements to our Search systems mean that they’re constantly getting better at understanding what you’re looking for. And since the world and people’s curiosities are always evolving, it’s really important that Search does, too. In fact, 15% of searches we see every day are entirely new. AI plays a major role in showing you helpful results, even at the outermost edges of your imagination.",
            "How our systems play togetherWe’ve developed hundreds of algorithms over the years, like our early spelling system, to help deliver relevant search results. When we develop new AI systems, our legacy algorithms and systems don’t just get shelved away. In fact, Search runs on hundreds of algorithms and machine learning models, and we’re able to improve it when our systems — new and old — can play well together. Each algorithm and model has a specialized role, and they trigger at different times and in distinct combinations to help deliver the most helpful results. And some of our more advanced systems play a more prominent role than others. Let’s take a closer look at the major AI systems running in Search today, and what they do.",
            "RankBrain — a smarter ranking systemWhen we launched RankBrain in 2015, it was the first deep learning system deployed in Search. At the time, it was groundbreaking — not only because it was our first AI system, but because it helped us understand how words relate to concepts. Humans understand this instinctively, but it’s a complex challenge for a computer. RankBrain helps us find information we weren’t able to before by more broadly understanding how words in a search relate to real-world concepts. For example, if you search for “what’s the title of the consumer at the highest level of a food chain,” our systems learn from seeing those words on various pages that the concept of a food chain may have to do with animals, and not human consumers. By understanding and matching these words to their related concepts, RankBrain understands that you’re looking for what’s commonly referred to as an “apex predator.”",
            "Thanks to this type of understanding, RankBrain (as its name suggests) is used to help rank — or decide the best order for — top search results. Although it was our very first deep learning model, RankBrain continues to be one of the major AI systems powering Search today.",
            "Neural matching — a sophisticated retrieval engineNeural networks underpin many modern AI systems today. But it wasn’t until 2018, when we introduced neural matching to Search, that we could use them to better understand how queries relate to pages. Neural matching helps us understand fuzzier representations of concepts in queries and pages, and match them to one another. It looks at an entire query or page rather than just keywords, developing a better understanding of the underlying concepts represented in them. Take the search “insights how to manage a green,” for example. If a friend asked you this, you’d probably be stumped. But with neural matching, we’re able to make sense of it. By looking at the broader representations of concepts in the query — management, leadership, personality and more — neural matching can decipher that this searcher is looking for management tips based on a popular, color-based personality guide.",
            "When our systems understand the broader concepts represented in a query or page, they can more easily match them with one another. This level of understanding helps us cast a wide net when we scan our index for content that may be relevant to your query. This is what makes neural matching such a critical part of how we retrieve relevant documents from a massive and constantly changing information stream.",
            "BERT — a model for understanding meaning and contextLaunched in 2019, BERT was a huge step change in natural language understanding, helping us understand how combinations of words express different meanings and intents. Rather than simply searching for content that matches individual words, BERT comprehends how a combination of words expresses a complex idea. BERT understands words in a sequence and how they relate to each other, so it ensures we don’t drop important words from your query — no matter how small they are. For example, if you search for “can you get medicine for someone pharmacy,” BERT understands that you’re trying to figure out if you can pick up medicine for someone else. Before BERT, we took that short preposition for granted, mostly sharing results about how to fill a prescription. Thanks to BERT, we understand that even small words can have big meanings.",
            "Today, BERT plays a critical role in almost every English query. This is because our BERT systems excel at two of the most important tasks in delivering relevant results — ranking and retrieving. Based on its complex language understanding, BERT can very quickly rank documents for relevance. We’ve also improved legacy systems with BERT training, making them more helpful in retrieving relevant documents for ranking. And while BERT plays a major role in Search, it’s never working alone — like all of our systems, BERT is part of an ensemble of systems that work together to share high-quality results.",
            "MUM — moving from language to information understandingIn May, we introduced our latest AI milestone in Search — Multitask Unified Model, or MUM. A thousand times more powerful than BERT, MUM is capable of both understanding and generating language. It’s trained across 75 languages and many different tasks at once, allowing it to develop a more comprehensive understanding of information and world knowledge. MUM is also multimodal, meaning it can understand information across multiple modalities such as text, images and more in the future.While we’re still in the early days of tapping into MUM’s potential, we’ve already used it to improve searches for COVID-19 vaccine information, and we’ll offer more intuitive ways to search using a combination of both text and images in Google Lens in the coming months. These are very specialized applications — so MUM is not currently used to help rank and improve the quality of search results like RankBrain, neural matching and BERT systems do.As we introduce more MUM-powered experiences to Search, we’ll begin to shift from advanced language understanding to a more nuanced understanding of information about the world. And as with all improvements to Search, any MUM application will go through a rigorous evaluation process, with special attention to the responsible application of AI. And when they’re deployed, they’ll join the chorus of systems that run together to make Search helpful."

            "Intimate partner violence (IPV), also known as domestic violence or relationship abuse, is a pattern of behavior used to gain or maintain power and control over a partner, and it affects more than 12 million people in the United States every year. One in four women and one in seven men aged 18 and older in the U.S. will be the victim of severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime. Relationship abuse comes in many forms — apparent or invisible; emotional, financial, digital or physical; in families, in couples and in relationships of all kinds — and the risk has only grown during the COVID-19 pandemic.The National Domestic Violence Hotline (The Hotline) is a vital service. Our mission is to answer the call to support and shift power back to those affected by relationship abuse — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Now, The Hotline is working with Google to help provide quicker access to domestic violence information and 24/7 support to those who need it.Starting today, when people in the U.S. search for information related to domestic violence on Google, they will see a box at the top of the search results displaying the contact information for The Hotline – with direct access to our phone and chat services. This will help survivors, especially those in crisis, get the information and connection to the 24/7 support they need quickly and with less scrolling. Finding the right information quickly is essential for survivors, as their window to safely reach out for support may be limited.",
            "The Hotline is the only national 24-hour domestic violence hotline providing compassionate support, life-saving resources and personalized safety planning via phone, online chat and text. Services are provided in English and Spanish through bilingual advocates and in more than 200 other languages through interpretation.As always, the safety of survivors is our primary concern. Our advocates are available 24/7 to answer questions and give advice about internet safety for survivors. They can suggest things like:Managing your search and browsing historyUsing computers found at your local library, Internet cafe, shelter, workplace or computer technology centerSetting up an alternate email account that a partner doesn’t know aboutSwiftly connecting survivors with support is critical right now, because the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated risk factors for domestic violence. More people are experiencing isolation and are limited in their ability to go to work, go to school or see friends and family. The pandemic has also accelerated an increase in economic and housing instability for many experiencing abuse: Since 2016, housing instability as a concern has grown by an average of 20% annually among those contacting The Hotline.All these factors heighten the risk of relationship abuse, and limit the ability of survivors to reach out for support. COVID-19 has left many survivors feeling trapped in their homes with an abusive partner – with limited time to get resources or information. To learn more about how the pandemic has affected survivors, read our Year One report.Through this partnership with Google, we want to ensure the first resource people see when searching for domestic violence is reliable, helpful information that empowers them to get support as quickly as possible."

            "I love New Year’s resolutions, and because of the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, I had plenty of time to focus on them. In 2020, I decided I might as well finally train for and run a marathon…and then because, well, I still had the extra hours in 2021, I decided to try to do it again, only faster. I also resolved to give back, so I began fostering dogs (and when you already have two, trust me, it’s a challenge). My husband and I also finished remodeling our basement, turning it into a separate studio apartment.Honestly, that’s a lot of doing. And as 2022 approaches, I think instead of using any extra time or spare motivation I have to come up with another challenge, maybe it’s time for a New Year’s non-resolution for me — a year where I focus on resting and recharging, instead of on constant doing.I’m likely not the only one feeling this way. In 2021, search interest in “anxiety” and “therapy” reached all-time highs, as did “how to maintain mental health” and \"self care ideas.\" And every year, “yoga” and “journaling” spike in January. In 2022, I want to do less and focus on taking care of myself, and here are a few tools I’m going to use to do that.Rest more2022 is going to be my year of sleep. The Nest Hub’s new Sleep Sensing will offer a better look at the quality of sleep I’m getting, and already the message I’ve received is: Get more of it. One piece of advice Sleep Sensing has given me based on my sleeping patterns is to try and get less light in my room — and I’m going to try waking up a little less abruptly by using Nest’s Gentle Wake Up feature, which slowly brightens my lights. And in stark comparison to my running goals from the past two years, in 2022 I’m going to try and run…less. Fitbit’s Daily Readiness feature tells me when it’s time for a rest day, a reminder I definitely need. (I blame running endorphins!)Practice mindfulnessFor me, mindfulness and meditation are more difficult than jumping up to physically do something. Search has a quick fix: Search “breathing exercise” and use the one-minute meditation.",
            "Take a solo tripI tend to over-plan trips — ask my family (there are a variety of Google Sheets dedicated to my vacations). In 2022, I’m not sure I can drop the side hustle of being my own personal travel agent, but I’m going to do the planning for a solo vacay. I like to think of myself as a Google Flights power user, and since I only have myself to think about, I only have to take my calendar into consideration when I set up a price alert for destinations I’m interested in. And I’ll use the Explore feature to select “outdoors” to narrow it down.Maybe I’ll decide on a low key break, though and just stay home. In 2021, searches for staycation reached an all-time high — if I truly want to “do less,” maybe I’ll consider that option instead…but the year is young, so I have plenty of time to decide."

            "There’s a lot to think about at the end of each year. What we accomplished, what we didn’t — what we made time for, or what we took a break from. At Google, the Search team looks at what sort of questions the world asked, and what answers we really needed. And of course, what momentary trends completely captivated us (looking at you, “tiktok pasta”).As a writer, something I’ve been thinking about in the last few weeks of 2021 are the words we used this year. 2020 was the year of “now more than ever,” a phrase that began to feel meaningless as the “now more than ever”-worthy moments kept coming (and admittedly, as we all kept calling them that). If 2020 was the year of “now more than ever,” then what was 2021?",
            "Once again, I turned to Ngrams, a Google tool launched in 2009 by part of the Google Books team. Ngrams shows how books and other pieces of literature have used certain words or phrases over time, and you can chart their popularity throughout the years. One caveat: Ngrams currently tracks data from 1800 to 2019 — prior to 2020, Ngrams’ data ranged from 1800 to 2012, but the team added a huge new dataset about two years ago. So while it remains to be seen how some sayings took over writing throughout 2020 and 2021, I wanted to see how the words we’re hearing and saying and writing today have shown up over time.My first nomination: “new normal.” This is a phrase that I personally have heard…well, now more than ever, I suppose. This isn’t the first time “new normal” appeared in the lexicon, though: You can see it began to see small bursts of usage in literature and other writing in the mid-19th century — though if you use Ngrams to see some of the examples of how it showed up, “new normal” was often in reference to types of academic institutions. And then “new normal” just sort of faded away…until the aughts, when it dramatically rose. Michael Ballback, who works on Google Books, told me that a lot of post-2000s data added comes from e-books, whereas older data mostly came from libraries, so perhaps this could account for some of the jump. In any case, today it now completely permeates our writing. (Which raises the question: Is there such a thing as normal if they’re constantly new?)",
            "Then of course, I thought of “vaccine,” which actually began its Ngrams debut on a high, falling sharply between 1800 and 1813…only to rise again in the early to mid 1900s, when many scholarly articles were published about things like typhoid, cholera and pertussis vaccinations. Then it goes up and down, up and down, to an all-time high in 2003. It’s since slightly fallen off — but remember, Ngrams’ data goes up until 2019, so I have my own assumptions about how it’s fared the past two years.",
            "Lastly, I took a look at “hybrid.” Obviously it’s a word that’s been around for awhile (according to Ngrams, it’s been in use since at least the year 1800, which is how far the tool’s data goes back) and has gently, steadily risen since. It spiked in the early ‘80s, though, but in browsing snippets from Google Books from this time period, it was used similarly to how it is now. Later in the aughts, we start seeing it used to describe cars, and today…well, you probably already know.",
            "What “hybrid” means hasn’t really changed, but it’s the situations we’re applying it to that have — there’s a much wider scope of daily life that falls under this category. “Hybrid” didn’t change, but how we live has. 2020 felt in many ways like a pause on life, and this year we began finding new, creative ways to adapt — a little of our old methods, mixed with the new. And that, to me, feels distinctly 2021."

            "When Dave Holmes started at Google nearly 10 years ago, he couldn’t have known how many projects he’d work on or things he’d help build. One of them he’s loved working, though, is Santa Tracker. “I’ve been working on Santa Tracker…well, I think for nearly as long as I’ve been at Google.”Santa has his own history with Google, too. A 2004 mapping software acquisition brought a new team to Google, and that team wondered: Could we put Santa’s flight on the map?So we did. Santa Tracker launched in 2004, and has been an important project at Google ever since. While there’s a small core team dedicated to Santa, up to 20 or so Googlers volunteer to help make it happen every year, and it’s become a true community effort. It’s also a way for our developers to try things and see what Google products can do. Sam Thorogood, who’s led our work with Santa for the last seven seasons, thought he’d try it out and work on showing off cool new web technologies for a bit. “Turns out I enjoyed it a lot, and I kept coming back to keep improving it,” he says.",
            "“We figured out how to do so many different things because of Santa Tracker — how to build things, how to launch things, how to make things accessible, how to improve web design, how to optimize tools,” Dave says. “I like to say that everything I’ve learned at Google, I learned from Santa.” And those lessons have benefited other areas at Google, like Doodles and apps developers create for events like Google I/O.Some years the Santa Tracker team adds lots of new functions and fun interactions, and other years they simply tweak what’s already there. Santa Tracker, like so many things at Google, has adjusted throughout the years: For instance, the elves ride bikes instead of driving cars now, and last and this year Santa wears a mask to protect himself and others against COVID-19. Also this year, when you ask “Where is Santa?” on Search, you’ll see a fun surprise (no spoilers here!).",
            "Among Dave’s favorite Santa Tracker projects is the Google Assistant integration, where people can ask to hear stories about Santa’s journey. He also enjoyed updating Santa’s soundtrack. He admits the team got a bit weary of hearing Santa’s same song on replay, so they came up with multiple tunes. “We ended up making a video similar to the crackling yule log ones, but featuring Santa.” (Go ahead and give it a listen.)Some highlights for Sam over the years include adding Google Maps Local Guides’ photos to Santa’s route, and Code Boogie, a coding game where you can teach elves to dance. He’s also personally responsible for Elf Maker, in which you can create your own elf. “I’m really proud of that!” And he points out Snowball Storm, too, which another developer made that he was particularly impressed by.There have also been little updates, like asking the creator of the Santa Tracker font to adjust the type so people all over the world could read it better. Of course, not everything Santa’s team worked on…worked. “One engineer who focused on AI and human movement came up with this idea for a game where you could enable tracking on your computer and teach the elves to dance,” Dave says, “and they would mimic your movement.” But just before launch…they found a glitch. “If the tracker lost you for a second…the elves' heads and arms would go flying off!” Santa and the team decided not to launch the game. “That game was sent back to Elf engineering for further work,” Dave says.Once all of this work is done, there’s the job of bringing Santa to everyone else. Part of Rachelle Lacroix’s work at Google for the past five holiday seasons has been doing exactly this. “Using marketing channels and social media, I help make sure people around the world can easily find and experience Santa Tracker,” she says. Rachelle says she’s loved seeing the creativity from teams come out in our work with Santa, but simply being a part of this group is one of the best parts for her. “Technical and creative Googlers alike really tap into their childhood when they work with Santa,” Rachelle says. “So much thought and care goes into every detail — and the team takes this work very seriously! Still, we find ways to have fun ... it's hard not to smile at all of the playful holiday puns that pop into our meetings and emails.”Dave and Sam both feel the same. “It's been the most fun meeting people — virtually or, in the ‘before times,’ by cycling around campus — who I wouldn't otherwise interact with,” Sam says.As the team prepares to help Santa launch this year, the work is winding down, and Dave and the rest of the group will return to their normal jobs. Still, the once-a-year project comes with its benefits. “It’s like a minor celebrity status,” Dave says. “I’ve loved telling my son I work with Santa.”"

            "Every day, millions of people come to Google Search to ask important questions about their wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic drove even more concern for our health and the health of our loved ones – and this year, searches for ways to heal reached record highs. We saw questions about vaccinations, therapists, body positivity and mental wellbeing, to name a few. Today, we launched our annual Year in Search, which takes a look back at the top-trending searches of the year. Here’s a glimpse into some of the trending searches of 2021, a year we looked for ways to feel better and heal together.Finding resources near meAcross the world, people searched for information on COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. The top trending \"near me\" queries in 2021 were \"covid vaccine near me\" and \"covid testing near me.” To help people find credible, timely testing and vaccine information, we updated Google Search information panels, and worked with national and international partners to help people get vaccinated and tested.Learning how to helpHelping ourselves and our communities was a priority for many of us. We asked questions about how to help others with anxiety and depression, and we also looked for help with our own mental wellbeing. Search interest for “therapists near me” hit record highs in 2021, and the phrase \"why do I feel anxious for no reason\" also hit an all-time high this year, spiking more than 400%. In addition to providing mental health resources and helplines, a quick Google Search also surfaces self-assessments to help you learn more about mental health topics like depression, anxiety, PTSD and postpartum depression.Evaluating information effectivelyIs it allergies or COVID? A sinus infection or COVID? Pfizer or Moderna? As many of us searched for health related information online, we wanted to know what we found was trustworthy. Connecting people with critical, timely and authoritative health information has been a crucial part of our role over the last year, and our team is constantly working to find ways to help people everywhere find credible and actionable information to help manage their health. To help people evaluate information online, we launched a new tool called About This Result, so you can learn more about the pages you see across a range of topics. About This Result helps people evaluate the credibility of sources, and decide which results are useful for them.Search continues to be one of the first stops people make when making decisions, big and small, about their health — and so much more.

            "Every year, the Search team takes a step back to look at the big picture to bring us Year in Search, a fascinating exercise in analyzing global trends. This year, Search showed us how people prepared to leave quarantine fashion behind as well as what celebrities, movies, TV shows and moments fascinated us. Here's a look at pop culture trends that really popped in 2021, according to Google Trends data.1. This year we saw search interest for “Millennial” and “Gen Z” go neck and neck, with interest in “Gen Z” reaching an all-time high and surpassing “Millennial” in March. So we decided to give the people what they want and looked at some of the trending Gen Z-related searches . The top trending Gen Z related search was for “Gen Z fashion.”",
            "2. This was followed by “Gen Z side part,” evidence of the oh-so-contentious hair debate.3. Another top trending hair-related search was for “are bangs in style?”4. Of course, with all this interest in Gen Z, it’s only natural that people were searching “Gen Z slang.”5. On that subject…what exactly is cheugy? You weren’t the only one wondering. It was the top trending definition search this year.6. We also saw people searching for “Gen Z jeans.” 👖(Asking for a friend: Are skinny jeans cheugy now?)7. In related searches: Many of us asked “how to style straight leg jeans.”",
            "8. Red carpets also returned this year, and “Megan Fox” 🦊 took the top trending red carpet look.9. “Adam Sandler” was this year's top trending source of celebrity outfit envy…so maybe some quarantine style is here to stay.10. Have you ever binge-watched a show so hard that you ended up wanting to dress like your favorite character? Well you wouldn’t be the only one. This year’s top trending fictional character outfit inspo came from “Outer Banks” character Sarah Cameron.11. Speaking of TV! No yearly recap is complete without the top trending TV shows, movies, songs and celebrities. The most-searched TV Show was “Squid Game” 🦑12. Kids of the 90s likely appreciate that “iCarly” was the top trending TV Reboot.13. Step aside, Hamilton: “In the Heights” was the top trending drama movie.14. The aptly titled “Halloween Kills” 🎃 stole the top spot among thriller movies.15. And another reboot — “Space Jam” — was the top trending comedy movie.16. For action movies, “Black Widow” was our winner.",
            "17. Movies weren’t the only kind of entertainment that hooked us, though, and there was one song in particular that drove (pun intended) many a search: That’s right, “drivers license” by Olivia Rodrigo. 🚥18. Ball is life! This year’s top trending overall search was the NBA. 🏀19. To round out this list, we had to include a few trends that were going, going, gone…viral. It’s been nearly a year since Bernie Sanders took Washington, D.C. by storm with his infamous winter wear, but “Bernie Sanders mittens” was the top trending meme for all of 2021. 🧤20. Ah yes, in 2021 we were introduced to the eternal question: Is it a Bones day or No Bones day? 🦴 Only Noodles knows.21. And there was another kind of noodle we were very interested in. You feta believe “tiktok pasta” 🍝 was the top trending recipe this year.If you can’t get enough of these trending queries, be sure to check out our full Year in Search list and film for more."

            "This year, searches for \"how to heal\" reached an all time high. Across the world, we were looking for ways to come back stronger.We reflected on difficult times that continued to test our resolve. We thought about those we lost, asking “how to honor someone.” We looked inward, searching for “how to take care of your mental health” and asking the big questions, like “how to be yourself” and “what is my purpose?”We looked outward, too – thinking about how we could help rebuild and strengthen our communities. We searched for how to make sustainable choices, how to help Afghan refugees, how to stop Asian hate and how to support people in need across the world – from communities in India battling the pandemic to communities in Texas facing severe weather.And we looked to move forward, searching, “how to make a come back.”As the world asked “how to be hopeful,” 2021 brought us hope. This was the year that search interest for “covid vaccine” officially surpassed interest in “covid testing.” Searches soared for “covid vaccine near me” – just as people eagerly asked when they could visit their family or eat in a restaurant again.Like last year, people continued to search for ways to stay connected and entertained at home (“Squid Game” took the top spot this year for searches for TV shows to watch). But we also started to navigate a return to life outside the house, wondering how we should go about ditching the sweatpants (the top trending search for “how to style…” was “how to style straight leg jeans”).As this year of comebacks comes to a close, we’re taking a closer look at trending topics across searches, news, people, “how to’s,” entertainment, trends and more from across almost 70 countries. Search can help you find a world of information – and what people search for can be a window into the world.

            "As a native Oregonian, I thought living in California would be an incredible break from the nine months of rain I’d endured growing up. What I didn’t realize was that 70-degree winters felt…wrong. Where were the mittens? The down jackets? The occasional snowy days? I’ve since moved back to the Pacific Northwest, and I’ve had a renewed appreciation for winter weather.In fact, I enjoy the chilly months of the year so much, I’ve put together a few ways to make the most of the cold weather.I love snowshoeing, and I always want to find new trails. I use Google Maps to look for mountain biking and hiking trails that are covered in snow in the winter. (Just look for the hiking icons, or the light dash lines that indicate trails.) If I come across a good one, I label it on Maps so I know how to get back.",
            "2. I’m a year-round runner, but once the temperature dips below 50 Fahrenheit and the roads get wet or icy, I need new gear — all of which I can find in one place using Google Shopping. You can select the Sports & Outdoors tab to browse — and turn on the deals filter for discounts.3. And when I’m returning from a chilly run, I can use the Google Home app to turn on my Nest Thermostat before I get home, so I know I’m not wasting energy while I’m out and the house will be toasty when I come in. I also use Home & Away Routines so that Nest knows when I’m out and can adjust my temperature automatically.4. OK fine, there’s one downside of winter weather, and that’s how early it gets dark. I use Google Assistant to notify me an hour before sunset so I can get outside for some sunshine before the sun goes down.5. We’ve started cutting down our own Christmas tree, which is actually pretty easy to do. A quick Google Search for cutting down a tree on federal land will help you find a map (and how you can purchase a permit). Then you can just use Google Maps to take you to the right area. 6. If I’m feeling really adventurous and ready to hit the slopes, I’ll check out the Explore tool on google.com/travel. I can set my home as the point of origin and then select “skiing” under the Interests filter and see what ski towns I can visit.",
            "7. I love a good Google Alert to stay up to date on what’s going on locally. Once November rolls around, I set one for “Oregon winter festivals.”8. Pixel cameras take incredible photos in dimly lit areas, so using Night Sight for shots of light displays or snowy nights is a no-brainer. And if you’ve already snagged a Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro, those photos will look even better: The new Pixel camera lets in 2.5 times as much light as the Pixel 5, and you can try out the new Motion Mode setting to capture an artsy falling snow pic.",

By providing timely and authoritative health information, plus relevant resources and tools on Google Search, we’re always exploring ways to help people make more informed choices about their health.

            "In Google’s early days, around this time every year, a group of us would run to Costco and buy supplies to take to Bay Area food banks and pantries. It was a grassroots effort that was scrappy and meaningful — and it introduced a lot of Googlers to how rewarding giving back can be. It made me want to learn what more we could do to have an even bigger impact.Inspired by our small and mighty food donation operation, I became a passionate supporter of Second Harvest Food Bank in Silicon Valley. And with guidance from food assistance experts, we established a dedicated team at Google in 2020 to work on tackling issues of food waste and food insecurity. Too many families are having to make difficult decisions no one should be forced to make: paying rent, bills, healthcare costs — or keeping food on their table. These challenges have only been compounded by the COVID-19 crisis, which has left more than 54 million working Americans struggling to find a meal. That’s nearly 16% of the country.Google co-founder Larry Page once said \"people are starving in the world not because we don't have enough food. It's because we're not yet organized to solve that problem.\" The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) reports that the world produces more than we need to feed every person on this planet. This isn’t a problem of supply, it’s a problem of distribution. And while solving this issue will require work from government, businesses, nonprofits and individuals working together, one way Google can help is to give people easy access to the information they need, when they need it.Helping people find food pantriesWhen you look at Google Search trends, you can see that searches for \"food bank\" and “food pantry” spike during the month of November.",
            "Food banks have always been critical to making sure people have regular access to nutritious food, but the ongoing pandemic has drastically increased their role as a crucial lifeline in so many communities. With the need for their services doubling or even tripling in some areas, we want to make sure that the people who need them most can find them.That’s why we’ve launched a new initiative to expand the information about food banks and pantries in Google Search and Maps. We’ve augmented existing coverage with data from two initial nonprofit partners: WhyHunger and Hunger Free America, and we’ve added information to make sure people searching for food support can find what they need. These changes are being made directly in Google Maps so food banks, food pantries and soup kitchens can focus on what matters most — getting people food.Still, some of these locations don’t yet have websites or phone numbers available on Google. So over the last two months, we've worked to update this information in Search and Maps, making 85,000 plus calls to verify local food banks and pantries. These efforts will continue through the holidays.",
            "We’ve also developed new Google Business Profile features specifically for food banks, pantries and soup kitchens. They can now provide details on their profile, like whether an appointment is needed, if there are eligibility requirements to receive food and what languages are spoken. They can also add information about their services, like whether prepared meals are available or if grocery delivery is an option. Additionally, pantries can specify whether they’re accepting new volunteers or soliciting food or monetary donations.Helping people access benefitsBeyond working with food pantries, we’re also helping people use Search to find out how to get and use food assistance benefits.Federal programs like the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP) feed more than 40 million Americans each year. We heard from users that information about these programs is often hard to find, especially for people who are using them for the first time. Today, if you search on Google for “SNAP benefits,” or the name of your local SNAP program, you’ll find direct links to each state’s eligibility guidelines and application process, including contact information for local food assistance agencies.",
            "Once approved, many people use Electronic Benefits Transfer cards (also known as EBT) to pay for their groceries. Now, if you search for “grocery stores that accept EBT” you can easily find USDA-approved stores that accept this form of payment — saving time and potential confusion.Supporting hunger relief organizations – and the communities they serveI’m also proud to announce that we’re contributing financial support as well. Since the COVID-19 crisis began, Googlers have stepped up – giving more than $22 million in personal donations and company-match to hunger relief organizations in the U.S. Today, Google is contributing an additional $2 million in support ($1 million in cash funding and $1 million in donated ads from Google.org) to 20 food banks, pantries and innovative hunger relief organizations across the country.There is no easy solution to these large-scale challenges that face our communities, but I’m hopeful that increasing access to information about local food support programs and services can help. Our teams are hard at work and committed to building new tools and features that support economic recovery in the U.S. – and around the world – as we weather the COVID-19 crisis. And I personally am really looking forward to getting back to sorting and distributing food with my family at our local food bank.You can make an impact by volunteering your time, making a donation, using your voice, or a combination of each — there are a number of ways we can all give back. If you need a place to start, you can donate to the largest national network of food banks, Feeding America. Or you can get involved locally: just search for your nearest food pantry on Google and contact them to see what they need. And if you know someone who might need food assistance, you can simply help by sharing resources. Spreading the word not only about what you’re doing to help, but why can make a huge difference."

Because while we already provide a range of options for people seeking to remove content from Search, we know that kids and teens have to navigate some unique challenges online, especially when a picture of them is unexpectedly available on the internet.With a newly implemented policy, anyone under the age of 18, or their parent or guardian, can now request the removal of their images from Search results, following a few simple steps. This means these images won’t appear in the Images tab or as thumbnails in any feature in Google Search.",
            "How to request the removal of images of minors from Google search resultsIf you’re under 18 and there’s an image of yourself that you want removed from Google results, you – or your parent, guardian or authorized representative – can follow these steps to request that it be removed:Visit the help page for this new policy to understand the information you’ll need to provide when using the request form.Start your removal request using the form at this support link.Fill out the form to report the imagery that is appearing in results. In the form, include information like:Image URLs of any images that you want removedURLs of any search results pages that contain the imagesSearch query terms that surface the images.After you submit the request, our teams will review it and reach out for any additional information we might need to verify it meets the requirements for removal. And we’ll notify you once we’ve taken down the image, if it meets the requirements.It’s important to note that removing an image from Google results doesn’t remove it from the internet. That’s why you might want to contact a site’s webmaster to ask that they remove the content, too. You can learn more about how to do that on our support page.We believe this change will help give young people more control over their digital footprint and where their images can be found on Search.

            "In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, people across the United States were losing their jobs or experiencing job insecurity. Over the course of the year, one in four people in the U.S. would apply for unemployment. People were looking for information on government assistance — in fact, searches for “unemployment benefits” increased by more than 5,000% in 2020.While the pandemic caused a spike, people have long been searching for this kind of information. Back in 2019, a team at Google wanted to look into helping people navigate government services online. The team, led by User Experience Research (UXR) Manager John Webb, started looking into how Google could help. Initially, John explains, the team was seeking users’ input to build a Search feature that would explain civic services and government quickly and easily. “Obviously, things became more complex — and urgent — very quickly,” he says.Sydney Hessel is also one of the leads on the project. She’s been a UX researcher for more than five years. As a result of COVID-19, she saw close friends lose their jobs suddenly. She knew how important this research could be. “We approached our work with empathy,” she says, “so we could deeply understand people’s experiences and how we could support them in the products we design.” The Google Experience Research Program recently relaunched its site, so more people can sign up to participate in future research like this to inform all kinds of products.",
            "As 2019 became 2020, the User Research team began recruiting study participants from a diverse group of people from different backgrounds and industries who’d been laid off, furloughed or had their shifts cut during COVID’s early days. Then, they used Google Meet for in-depth, one-on-one interviews. “We asked about their job situation, what they saw as their next steps to make ends meet and how Search could be designed to better support them,” Sydney says. Everyone from product managers to engineers joined the sessions.“Our team also conducted both in-person and remote studies with more than 100 people,” John says. “Before COVID-19, we had teams in many different places, working to understand what people in these places needed.” On-the-ground research was cut short and interviewing moved to Google Meet, which John says went pretty smoothly. Being able to continue interviews via video calls was essential, and meant that people could offer insight about employment conditions as they developed. Plus, the early, in-person research had its benefits, too. “Being proactive and doing interviews in person before COVID became more serious is what allowed us to jump into building the product so quickly,” John explains. “It helped us create a more empathetic tool — we were more aware of cultural nuances, and how people in different countries with different government benefits would need different kinds of help.”Information about unemployment benefits eligibility and other government services can be hard to understand, making it difficult to navigate the process and make informed decisions. “We actually found that a lot of the people we talked to didn’t even know there were benefits they qualified for,” John says. So UXR took what they learned back to product teams at Google — which soon led to the launch of new, dedicated information panels in Search for Unemployment and other benefits. These information panels include robust local information about eligibility, as well as direct links and information about how to apply in each state.",
            "Sydney says seeing the team’s research inform the design of the product — and such an important one — was incredibly encouraging. “It was a really moving and motivating experience for the whole team,” she says. “These interviews fired us up to build quickly and intentionally for the many people facing economic hardship during this time.”We encourage everyone to help shape the future of Google and our products. Sign up to lend your insights to the Google Research team."

            "At Google, we like to say that Search is not a solved problem: We’re constantly making improvements (more than 4,800 last year alone). These changes can be big launches or small tune-ups, but they’re all designed to make Search work better for you, and to make sure you can find relevant, high quality information when you need it.One of the key ways we determine if an improvement to Search works well is through the help of search quality raters. This group of more than 10,000 people all over the world work from a common set of search quality rater guidelines used to evaluate the quality of search results — which are publicly available. Today, we wanted to give you an idea of how these guidelines work, and how — just like Search itself — they improve over time.",
            "What are the search quality rater guidelines?The quality rater guidelines are more than 170 pages long, but if we have to boil it down to one phrase, we’d say they help make sure Search is returning relevant results from the most reliable sources available.Information quality is at the heart of Search, and our systems fundamentally work to surface high-quality information. The rater guidelines help raters determine if a planned improvement is meeting that goal by providing a clear, uniform definition that all raters use to assess the results they see.More specifically, high-quality information is content which demonstrates expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness on a topic, or E-A-T for short. For example, a health site with content from doctors and produced by a medical institution would have a high level of what many would consider to be expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness. The rater guidelines also define low-quality content on the web, such as content that spreads hate or seeks to deceive users.",
            "Who uses the guidelines?As we noted, the changes we make to Search are rigorously tested and evaluated by real people. Our search quality raters provide us with insights and evaluate pages against our guidelines to help make sure our systems — and proposed improvements — are working as intended.What that looks like in practice is often a “side-by-side” test where a rater will look at two sets of Search results, one from the current version of Google and the other from an improvement we’re testing. Raters will review the pages in each set of results, and evaluate if the pages are a helpful match for the query based on our rater guidelines.The ratings they provide don’t directly impact how a page or site appears in Search. Instead, they help us measure how well our systems are working to deliver great content.",
            "How often are the rater guidelines updated?Just like we make improvements to Search, we update the rater quality guidelines from time to time to make sure they’re working as intended.Some changes are meant to tackle issues we’ve identified in Search, and may include expanded sections and new examples to help guide raters. For example, in 2017, we updated our guidelines to provide more detailed examples of low-quality web pages that included misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes or other content.Sometimes, we identify concepts that are especially challenging for raters. We then make changes to the guidelines to improve ratings. In 2020, for instance, we provided new guidance on how to tell if a result from a dictionary or encyclopedia would be useful for a certain query.Other changes focus on things like refreshing the language for clarity and updating organization. That’s what made up most of our October 2021 update, which included clarifications of what constitutes lowest quality content, and refreshed and modernized guidance on researching the reputation of websites.We rigorously review, test and evaluate all changes to ensure they’re helpful and having the intended effect. And we have a publicly available log at the end of our guidelines describing in detail any changes we make. Ultimately, these updates are designed to make Search work better for you."

Earlier this year, we launched a redesign of the Search results page on mobile for a more modern experience that’s easier to scan and navigate. Today, we’re making browsing search results more seamless and intuitive with the introduction of continuous scrolling on mobile devices. Now, when you reach the bottom of a search results page on your phone, the next set of results will automatically load with relevant information.",

In fact, most people who want additional information tend to browse up to four pages of search results. With this update, people can now seamlessly do this, browsing through many different results, before needing to click the “See more” button.For example, for broader, more open-ended questions like “What can I do with pumpkins?” you may want to consider more results and inspiration before deciding how to move forward. Scrolling through a wider range of results may show you tons of options you hadn’t considered, like no-carve pumpkin decor ideas for Halloween, pumpkin seed recipes that make your pumpkin worth carving and more ideas for how to make the most out of your gourd.So for everyone with a little extra curiosity, this new Search experience is starting to gradually roll out today for most English searches on mobile in the U.S."

            "According to the UN, more plants and animals are threatened with extinction now than in any other period of human history — approximately 1 million species globally. The accelerating pace of extinction is an urgent matter, and at this week’s UN biodiversity conference representatives from countries all over the world are coming together virtually to set out a plan for how to combat the challenge of better protecting our endangered ecological ecosystem.Sweden, which is home to much of the iconic wildlife in the northern hemisphere — from moose and bears to reindeer and wolverines— currently has 2,249 threatened species, according to the IUCN Red List. Each of these animals plays a vital role in the ecosystem we are all a part of, yet according to a recent study by Kantar Sifo, 30% of Swedes don’t believe or know if there are animals currently at risk of becoming extinct in Sweden.Meet five endangered species in 3DToday, in collaboration with the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, and in an effort to raise awareness of endangered animals, we are bringing five new Swedish endangered species to Search in augmented reality. Now, by simply searching for the lynx, arctic fox, white-backed woodpecker, harbour porpoise or moss carder bee in the Google App and tapping “View in 3D”, people from all over the world will be able to meet the animals up close in a life-size scale with movement and sound.",
            "Experts from the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation have selected these specific animals for their varying types of reasons for endangerment in the country and relevance to certain types of habitats, based on the IUCN’s Red List. The white-backed woodpecker and the harbour porpoise (in the Baltic sea) are “critically” endangered, with only a few individuals left of each species. The arctic fox has an “endangered” threat status due to its decreasing population, and the lynx and the moss carder bee are considered “vulnerable” - meaning that their natural habitats need to be protected for these species to be able to continue to reproduce in the wild. These animals also exist in other regions and outside of the Nordics, with varying threat levels from none to urgent.Reasons for endangermentThe white-backed woodpecker is affected by loggingThe harbour porpoise is affected by toxins and noise pollutionThe arctic fox’s habitat is at risk due to climate changeThe lynx is affected by traffic and illegal huntingThe moss carder bee is contending with a decreasing number of flowersPreserving endangered animals is a complex effort that requires collective action. Everyone can do something, and by launching this new Search experience we hope that we can help people in and outside of Sweden learn more about the issues at hand and experience some of nature's beloved creatures up close.Whether you want to take a photo with the arctic fox or teach your family about the moss carder bee, the #Google3D animals are available for anyone to try out starting today through Google Search."

            "Today, there’s more information accessible at people’s fingertips than at any point in human history. And advances in artificial intelligence will radically transform the way we use that information, with the ability to uncover new insights that can help us both in our daily lives and in the ways we are able to tackle complex global challenges.At our Search On livestream event today, we shared how we’re bringing the latest in AI to Google’s products, giving people new ways to search and explore information in more natural and intuitive ways.Making multimodal search possible with MUMEarlier this year at Google I/O, we announced we’ve reached a critical milestone for understanding information with Multitask Unified Model, or MUM for short.We’ve been experimenting with using MUM’s capabilities to make our products more helpful and enable entirely new ways to search. Today, we’re sharing an early look at what will be possible with MUM. In the coming months, we’ll introduce a new way to search visually, with the ability to ask questions about what you see. Here are a couple of examples of what will be possible with MUM.",
            "With this new capability, you can tap on the Lens icon when you’re looking at a picture of a shirt, and ask Google to find you the same pattern — but on another article of clothing, like socks. This helps when you’re looking for something that might be difficult to describe accurately with words alone. You could type “white floral Victorian socks,” but you might not find the exact pattern you’re looking for. By combining images and text into a single query, we’re making it easier to search visually and express your questions in more natural ways.",
            "Some questions are even trickier: Your bike has a broken thingamajig, and you need some guidance on how to fix it. Instead of poring over catalogs of parts and then looking for a tutorial, the point-and-ask mode of searching will make it easier to find the exact moment in a video that can help.Helping you explore with a redesigned Search pageWe’re also announcing how we’re applying AI advances like MUM to redesign Google Search. These new features are the latest steps we’re taking to make searching more natural and intuitive.First, we’re making it easier to explore and understand new topics with “Things to know.” Let’s say you want to decorate your apartment, and you’re interested in learning more about creating acrylic paintings.",
            "If you search for “acrylic painting,” Google understands how people typically explore this topic, and shows the aspects people are likely to look at first. For example, we can identify more than 350 topics related to acrylic painting, and help you find the right path to take.We’ll be launching this feature in the coming months. In the future, MUM will unlock deeper insights you might not have known to search for — like “how to make acrylic paintings with household items” — and connect you with content on the web that you wouldn’t have otherwise found.",
            "Second, to help you further explore ideas, we’re making it easy to zoom in and out of a topic with new features to refine and broaden searches. In this case, you can learn more about specific techniques, like puddle pouring, or art classes you can take. You can also broaden your search to see other related topics, like other painting methods and famous painters. These features will launch in the coming months.",
            "Third, we’re making it easier to find visual inspiration with a newly designed, browsable results page. If puddle pouring caught your eye, just search for “pour painting ideas\" to see a visually rich page full of ideas from across the web, with articles, images, videos and more that you can easily scroll through. This new visual results page is designed for searches that are looking for inspiration, like “Halloween decorating ideas” or “indoor vertical garden ideas,” and you can try it today.Get more from videosWe already use advanced AI systems to identify key moments in videos, like the winning shot in a basketball game, or steps in a recipe. Today, we’re taking this a step further, introducing a new experience that identifies related topics in a video, with links to easily dig deeper and learn more.",
            "Using MUM, we can even show related topics that aren’t explicitly mentioned in the video, based on our advanced understanding of information in the video. In this example, while the video doesn’t say the words “macaroni penguin’s life story,” our systems understand that topics contained in the video relate to this topic, like how macaroni penguins find their family members and navigate predators. The first version of this feature will roll out in the coming weeks, and we’ll add more visual enhancements in the coming months.Across all these MUM experiences, we look forward to helping people discover more web pages, videos, images and ideas that they may not have come across or otherwise searched for. A more helpful GoogleThe updates we’re announcing today don’t end with MUM, though. We’re also making it easier to shop from the widest range of merchants, big and small, no matter what you’re looking for. And we’re helping people better evaluate the credibility of information they find online. Plus, for the moments that matter most, we’re finding new ways to help people get access to information and insights. All this work not only helps people around the world, but creators, publishers and businesses as well.  Every day, we send visitors to well over 100 million different websites, and every month, Google connects people with more than 120 million businesses that don't have websites, by enabling phone calls, driving directions and local foot traffic.As we continue to build more useful products and push the boundaries of what it means to search, we look forward to helping people find the answers they’re looking for, and inspiring more questions along the way."

            "Ver abajo versión en españolAt the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which I have the honor to lead as president and CEO, helping Latino-owned businesses succeed is at the center of our mission. Our responsibility to the more than 4.7 million Latino-owned businesses and our growing network of 260 local chambers and business associations nationwide is to pursue and advocate for inclusive economic growth and development that build shared prosperity.We represent the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in the U.S., and we don’t take that responsibility lightly. The number of Latino business owners has grown by 34% over the last 10 years compared to just 1% for all other businesses, according to a recent study by the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative, and much of this growth has been driven by Latinas. These new businesses are invigorating, highlight our potential and are what motivates me everyday.In 2020, with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, our chambers became emergency rooms for small businesses. We quickly mobilized and awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants directly to Latino owners and our local chambers to provide assistance. These funds were a lifeline for Latino businesses to keep the lights on, make payroll, rent and meet other critical needs.We also provided technical assistance, established online resource hubs in English and in Spanish and graduated more than 200 Latino-owned small businesses through our accelerator program.Last year was also our most active year in Washington, D.C. We raised $850 billion to provide assistance for our Latino small business members. We advocated for access to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for both Latino-owned businesses and 501(c) (6) Chambers of Commerce.As we take a moment to reflect on our progress to date, we have our eyes on the future. There is no denying that the world has dramatically changed, and we need to adapt and thrive, not just to survive. And technology is driving change forward faster than ever before.We got a glimpse of the transformational power of technology through our partnership with Google last year. We collaborated to provide extra funding and Grow with Google curriculum support to 40 of our chambers across the country. Together, we trained 10,000 Latino small businesses and the initial results and impact we've seen is truly remarkable.Google and the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce share a deep commitment to economic opportunity, development and advocacy for Latinos. This is why today, we are sharing that Google will be making a $5 million investment in Latino-owned businesses and community organizations.  Together we are also unveiling a new Latino-owned attribute that will be available across Google Search, Maps and Shopping. All this is part of Google's $15 million investment in economic equity for Latinos.",
            "Building more resilient Latino businessesToday, we are deepening our partnership with Google with an additional investment that will allow us to create Grow with Google digital resource centers and train an additional 10,000 Latino business owners on how to use digital tools to grow their business. This work is critical to setting up Latino business owners for success for the long haul. These new skills, training and resources will help them be competitive in today's digital economy and allow us to help aspiring entrepreneurs to think digital-first. Google.org is also providing funding to support the Latino Community Foundation's Entrepreneurship Fund, an initiative that strengthens Latino-led small businesses and micro-entrepreneurs across California. It will directly invest in 150+ micro-entrepreneurs to support the tireless work of street vendors, cleaning services, landscapers, childcare providers and other micro-entrepreneurs. For Latino-owned businesses, running a business is often a family affair, and the Entrepreneurship Fund will increase and improve the online presence for Latino-owned small restaurants through the creation of websites and social media accounts designed and managed by youth participating in tech skills building programs.This is in addition to Google's ongoing support of nonprofits through $3 million in donated ads to Latino organizations. This includes the Hispanic Access Foundation, which uses Google.org's support to advertise internships for Latino college students, fundraise for DACA fee scholarships, and more — all in service of enabling more Latinos in the U.S. to achieve economic success.Identify and buy from Latino-owned businessesToday, we are partnering with Google to unveil a Latino-owned attribute that will be available on Search, Maps and Shopping, in the coming weeks, so businesses can easily identify as Latino-owned on Google. This update builds on the Black-owned, Veteran-owned and Women-owned business attributes, and is another way people can support diverse businesses across Google’s products and platforms.",
            "For more than 20 years, Google has been at the forefront of democratizing access for all —  it's one of its core values. Underrepresented groups have been beneficiaries of that mission, which is still alive today. This is why we deeply believe Google's open platforms, digital training, tools and resources are critical to advancing economic equity for the Latino community.  Today's investments and product updates will provide our members, chambers and our communities a much needed boost. We are glad to help spotlight Latino-owned businesses in a new light, showcase our resilient spirit and invoke action. We are energized by our momentum and are eager to get back to business. I believe our future is bright - and today thanks to Google, it's a little brighter.",

            "For over two decades of Search, we’ve been at the forefront of innovation in language understanding to help deliver on our mission of making the world’s information more accessible and useful for everyone. We’ve seen how critical these advancements are to making information more helpful, and being able to better connect people to creators, publishers and businesses on the web. It’s this constant improvement in understanding human language that’s enabled us to send more traffic to the web every year since Google was created.",
            "We’ve also seen how AI models have significantly improved language innovation. Each successive milestone, from neural nets, to BERT, to MUM, has blown us away with the step changes in information understanding they’ve offered. But with each step forward, we look closely at the limitations and risks new technologies can present.",
            "Across Google, we have been examining the risks and challenges associated with more powerful language models, and we’re committed to responsibly applying AI in Search. Here are some of the ways we do that.",
            "Training on high quality dataWe pretrain our models on high-quality data to reduce their potential to perpetuate undesirable biases that may exist in web content. In the case of MUM, we ensured that training data from the web was designated as high-quality based on our search quality metrics, which are informed by our Search Quality Rater Guidelines and driven by our quality rating and evaluation system. This substantially reduces the risk of training on misinformation or explicit content, for example, and is key to our approach.",
            "And as part of our efforts to build a Search experience that works for everyone, MUM was trained on over 75 languages from around the world.",
            "Rigorous EvaluationEvery improvement to Google Search undergoes a rigorous evaluation process to ensure we’re providing more relevant, helpful results. Our Search Quality Rater Guidelines are our north star for how we evaluate great search results. Human raters follow these guidelines and help us understand if our improvements are better fulfilling people’s information needs.",
            "This evaluation process is central to the responsible application of any improvement to Search, whether we’re introducing powerful new systems like BERT or MUM, or simply adding a new feature.",
            "Some changes are bigger than others, so we have to adjust our process accordingly. At the time of its introduction to Search, BERT impacted 1 in 10 English-language queries, so we scaled our evaluation process to be even more rigorous than usual. We subjected our systems to an unprecedented amount of scrutiny, increasing both the scale and granularity of quality testing, to help ensure they weren’t introducing concerning patterns into our systems.",
            "While our standard evaluation process helps us judge launches across a representative query stream, for some improvements, we also more closely examine whether changes provide quality gains or losses across specific slices of queries, or topic areas. This allows us to identify if concerning patterns exist and pursue mitigations before launching an improvement to Search.",
            "Search is not perfect, and any application of AI will not be perfect — this is why any change to Search involves extensive and constant evaluation and testing.",
            "Responsible application designIn addition to working with responsibly designed and trained models, the thoughtful design of products and applications is key to addressing some of the challenges of language models. In Search, many of these critical mitigations take place at the application level, where we can focus on the end-user experience and more effectively manage risk in smaller models designed for specific tasks.",
            "When we adopt new AI technologies such as BERT or MUM, they’re able to help improve individual systems to perform tasks more efficiently and effectively. This approach allows us to focus the scope of our evaluation and understand if an application is introducing concerning patterns. In the event that we do find concerning behavior, we’re able to design much more targeted solutions.",
            "Minding our footprintTraining and running advanced AI models can be energy consumptive. Another benefit of training smaller, application-specific models is that the energy costs of the larger base model, such as MUM, are amortized over the many different applications.",
            "The Google Research team recently published research detailing the energy costs of training state-of-the art language models, and their findings show that combining efficient models, processors, and data centers with clean energy sources can reduce the carbon footprint of a model by as much as one thousand-fold — and we follow this approach to train our models in Search.",
            "Language models in practiceNew language models like MUM have enormous potential to transform our ability to understand language and information about the world. And while they may be powerful, they do not make our existing systems obsolete. Today, Google Search employs hundreds of algorithms and machine learning models, none of which are wholly reliant on any singular, large model.",
            "Amongst these hundreds of applications are systems and protections designed specifically to ensure you have a safe, high quality experience. For example, we design our ranking systems to surface relevant and reliable information. Even if a model were to present issues around low quality content, our systems are built to counteract this.",
            "As we’re able to introduce new technologies like MUM into Search, they’ll help us greatly improve our systems and introduce entirely new product experiences. And they can also help us tackle other challenges we face. Improved AI systems can help bolster our spam fighting capabilities and even help us combat known loss patterns. In fact, we recently introduced a BERT-based system to better identify queries seeking explicit content, so we can better avoid shocking or offending users not looking for that information, and ultimately make our Search experience safer for everyone.",
            "We look forward to making Search a better, more helpful product with improved information understanding from these advanced language models, and bringing these new capabilities to Search in a responsible way."

            "Today’s Google Doodle celebrates the life and legacy of Swedish DJ, record producer and songwriter Tim Bergling — also known by his stage name, Avicii — on what would have been his 32nd birthday. From producing hit songs that topped international charts to headlining festivals around the world, Tim will forever be remembered as one of the pioneers and most influential visionaries of electronic dance music.In 2018, Tim passed away at 28-years-old from suicide after struggling with mental health issues. In his memory, Tim’s father Klas and his mother Anki started a foundation to raise awareness and address the stigma of mental health among young people — Tim Bergling Foundation. To remember Tim on this day as well as learn more about mental health, we talked to Tim’s father Klas Bergling.Tell us about Tim in your own words — how do you remember him? Klas: Tim was a kind and open person, full of energy, stubbornness and integrity. He had a special set of attributes, and if you watched the documentary about his life, I think you can also tell he wasn’t really built for fame in the way he was exposed to it. Despite his success and fame, he remained humble and treated people with kindness and equal respect. Was there a moment when you understood how musically talented he was? Klas: When Tim was about 10-years-old, he sang the Swedish national anthem at full capacity. He really lived in the moment when doing that, and it was times like this I initially understood there was something special there. Being part of a generation that didn’t grow up with house music, I used to view it as a monotonous, repetitive beat. When I started taking power walks back in the early days of Tim’s career, listening to his music, I realized what beautiful melodies were captured within the songs. It was an “aha moment” —  this is really music — and I started needing it to get me going. Tim produced more melodic songs over the years, with “Bromance” being one of the big eye-openers to his talent for me personally.Were there any moments you were especially proud of Tim during his career? Klas: Tim was such a special person, I was always proud of him for just being the person he was. In terms of his musical accomplishments, I will never forget when he played in a park called Strömparterren in Stockholm in the early days of his career. He’d told me explicitly to not come — maybe because it wasn’t very cool to have your father around at that age — but I went anyway and hid behind a tree. It was a great evening and I remember feeling surprised, amazed and very proud. When I came to find him backstage afterwards, he was so glad I came. An especially proud moment was also when Tim played in Globen Arena, today named Avicii Arena in effort to bring more attention to mental health, and I decided to sit completely by myself to take in the experience, as well as when the whole family went to watch him play at the festival “Summerburst” at Stockholm Olympic Stadium. He performed brilliantly at both shows — they were such great evenings.",
            "After Tim passed away, you and your wife Anki started the Tim Bergling Foundation. Can you tell us about this work? Klas: After Tim’s suicide, a lot of people reached out to us. Some who were in similar situations, but also a lot of fans who’d been following him throughout the years. Many people told us that Tim and his songs meant a lot to them and they felt like they knew him, which I think they did in a sense.The scale of mental health issues among young people is staggering. Tim was always interested in psychology and spirituality, and we wanted to honor him by doing what we could to help others. That’s how we brought the Tim Bergling Foundation to life, with the goal of contributing to young people’s mental health, lowering the rate of suicide among young people as well as removing the stigma around it. It’s not something you can do on your own, you need to cooperate broadly, and that’s what we try to do. We’re interested in bringing music into the picture as well, and have started working with organizations to spark young people's creativity by giving them better access to creating and remixing music of their own. What advice would you give to someone who has a friend or family member experiencing anxiety, depression or mental illness? Klas: It’s not always easy, not least due to the stigma around these topics; it can be hard to talk about. But that’s what we need to do — talk about it. Simple things like asking questions can go a long way in helping someone heal. And if you see someone moving in the wrong direction, you should encourage or help them seek support. I also think it’s very important for companies to get more engaged in these conversations and enable their employees to talk more openly about mental health. People everywhere grieved Tim’s passing and celebrated his legacy — what has that been like for your family? Klas: It’s given us great support in our sorrow and grief, a privilege we understand few in the same situation experience. You’ll always feel alone in a sense, but the love we’ve received from all around the world has meant a lot. I truly believe the small things — a smile, a short note — mean so much to people who are grieving. It can be hard to know what to do, and you often feel like whatever you do it’s not enough, but a few words often go a long way. Is there a song of Tim’s that has a special meaning to you?Klas: I always come back to the song “Bromance.” The song stands for so much that Tim was, and sends a message of friendship, which was always important to Tim."

            "Wherever your kids will be learning from this year, one thing is undeniable: The school year is fast-approaching. Over the past two years, my family's adopted a few new routines — some that will stick, and others we'll need to adjust. Here's how I'm using Google Assistant and the latest educational Search features to help keep my family on track and connected — while still making time for some fun.Make mornings more funI already use Family Bell on my smart speakers and smart displays to help us stay on top of our routines throughout the day, with bells that remind me when it's time for family dinner or to water the plants. In several weeks, Family Bell will be available to ring on mobile devices, making it even easier to set up and use throughout your day. Also coming soon, Family Bell will offer new, customizable bells that will initiate a checklist on your Nest Hub. I’ve been testing this feature and it’s been a great way to remind my kids what they need to do before heading out the door for school in a fun way— things like making their beds, getting dressed and brushing their teeth. When a task is completed, my kids enjoy the fun, on-screen celebratory animations and sounds that appear. I’m also planning to make a checklist for bedtime since it’s been working so well!",
            "To start my own day, I’ll use a new feature coming soon that will automatically start my morning routine, check the weather and play the news, once I dismiss my morning alarm. To set this up, I’ll simply add \"dismiss an alarm\" as the start to my morning Routine.Feeling close to my kids, even when we’re not togetherFor the first time in a long time, my kids won't be home with me all day. I made sure my family group was set up so I could have peace of mind knowing where everyone is during the day. I can say \"Hey Google, where's my family?\" to make sure they made it to school safely or are still at soccer practice. I can also send messages to the group throughout the day with Family Broadcast. When I head back to the office later this year and I’m running a bit late, I'll be able to say “Hey Google, tell my family: I’m leaving in five!” to send a message to our personal and home devices so they know I’m on my way home.Keep the learning going at homeI always carve out time for story hour with my kids. For Harry Potter fans, Assistant will soon have new stories from Pottermore Publishing that you can access from a smart display or Android device. Just say “Hey Google, talk to Fantastic Beasts Story” to enjoy the magic of the Wizarding World beasts. Discover a world map of beasts and wander the globe while you listen to audiobook highlights.",
            "Having grown up in various countries, it’s important to me that my kids have access to all kinds of stories. I'm thrilled that we've partnered with The English Schoolhouse, an award-winning, Black woman-owned publishing house, to bring more diverse teaching tools and stories to Assistant in the coming weeks. Soon you’ll be able to say, “Hey Google, talk to ‘Tallulah the Tooth Fairy CEO’ story” — or “Hey Google, talk to ‘Elijah Everett, Kid Principal’ story.” I’ll even play one of my favorite guessing games with the kids by saying “Hey Google, talk to Guess the Drawing for Kids” on my Nest Hub. Discover more fun stories by asking, “Hey Google, tell me a story” or find other fun family activities by saying “Hey Google, teach my family something new.” (With a parent's permission, children under 13, or the applicable age in their country, can have a personalized Google Assistant experience, powered by Family Link.) While my own young kids aren’t quite ready for advanced math, chemistry and physics, older learners can use different Search tools to understand complex concepts — Search’s new interactive periodic table is a great example. Using a phone or computer, these Augmented Reality and 3D models help anyone quickly visualize an atom. Zoom in and see the electrons orbiting the nucleus and the protons and neutrons that make it up.",
            "I can even brush up on my own Spanish with the “Live Translation” Assistant button in Search on my phone when I need to remember a specific word or phrase. Hopefully this school year goes smoother than the last, but it’s a tough transition every year. These new tools can help make the switch to the school year an easy one for the whole family."

        "heading": "15 tips for getting the most out of Google Trends",
        "imp_heading": "Search",
        "Publish Date": "Aug 11, 2021",
        "article_paragraphs": [
            "To celebrate Google Trends’s 15th anniversary, we took a look at what questions about it have…well, trended. “How to use Google Trends?” and “how does Google Trends work?” were among the most-searched. So we decided to answer them with these 15 tips to help you get the most out of the tool and uncover interesting insights. 1. Data by date: Google Trends can tell you what people were searching for at any date from 2004 to a few minutes ago. It’s also based on two datasets: historic (2004-three days ago) and real-time (past week). Real-time is more granular, right down to minute-by-minute.2. Trending versus top-searched: Trending (or rising) searches are those that are accelerating the fastest, while top-searched, or “most-searched,” are the most-searched queries in a specific time frame. Trending searches are useful for seeing how things have changed.3. Choose topics when you can: When you start on Google Trends, you get the option to either search for a “term” or “topic.” We recommend choosing “topic” when possible. Topics are language agnostic and account for spelling variations (and mistakes!), as well as multiple names for the same thing.",
            "4. Compare big places to small: How do you compare searches for the same thing in two different locations? Well, Google Trends normalizes Search data to make comparisons between terms easier. Search results are normalized to the time and location of a query. This means that Search results by geography are comparable, so you can see that the metro area most  searching for brunch this year is a tie between Charleston, South Carolina and Miami, Florida. Whereas the top metro area searching for breakfast is Panama City, Florida.5. Today’s trends: For a number of countries around the world, you can see what is trending each day. It’s also where you will get a sense of the volume of searches.6. Find out what’s trending right now: Real-time search trends are great for seeing what’s happening in the moment and in the context of news coverage.",
            "7. Always compare: If you want to understand the scale of a trend, use relative comparisons to gauge popularity. Weather is one of my favorite topics to use as a point of reference. It is one of the largest and most consistently searched for topics everyday.",
            "8. See how different places search for the same thing: This is one of my favorite hidden features of Trends. You can compare up to five topics or search terms, and for each one, you can specify the geography. For example, you can see how searches for COVID-19 varied in different countries around the world over the past 12 months.",
            "9. Trends can help us visualize common interests: Google Trends is truly a human-centric dataset. We search for what we are interested in. Even if those interests may feel obscure at times, you’re likely not alone in wanting more information on a given topic. Google Trends helps us visualize and explore our dreams, dogs and cats and even how to fix a toilet.  10. Trends are not polls: Google Trends is not a tool for creating scientific polls and shouldn’t be confused with polling data. It merely reflects the search interest in particular topics during a specified duration of time. 11. …But they can tell you a lot: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) uses Trends to track GDP each week, in between its quarterly releases, to get a more granular view of what’s happening to the world’s economy.12. Autocomplete is not the same as Trends data: Autocomplete tries to predict what you're typing so you can get to what you're looking for faster. But because it's a predictive feature, we don't want to surprise people with predictions. So even though you can search for whatever you want, we have policies for what can appear in Autocomplete. Trends, on the other hand, is a tool where you can look up search interest in any query. Because you're typing it in and asking to see the results, we'll show you available Trends data for almost any query.13. See what’s Trending near you: Another interesting feature on Trends in the U.S. is the ability to see what’s been trending in a metro area without even putting in a search term. You can see what was trending over the past month, or even year. For example, here’s what was trending in San Francisco over the past month.",
            "14. Download your data: Just click on the download button next to each chart. For a bigger dataset, check out this new daily trending searches dataset from the Google BigQuery team.15. And remember: Have fun with Google Trends! Around 15% of queries on Google Search each day have never been seen before. It’s a great way to peek behind the curtain at the constantly changing interests of people around the world."

            "When we initially launched an experimental version of Trends 15 years ago, we pointed out ways people could use  data to look at things like ice cream flavor popularity  and singing competition contestants, or how much people searched for certain politicians. Since then, Google Trends has become an important resource for journalists, researchers, scholars, brands — and anyone else who wants to use it. I’ve been working on Google Trends for almost five years as a Data Editor. I wanted to catch up with Yossi Matias, VP of Engineering and Research, who led the team that launched Trends. I took some time to talk about those early days with Yossi, as well as where we see Trends heading.",
            "Simon: Where did the idea for Google Trends come from? Yossi: Google Trends was initially an experimental tool in Google Labs designed to help us understand trends on Google Search. For the first time, we were able to leverage this aggregated data to better understand what people were interested in and what they were looking for when they came to Search. We realized how useful it would be to launch Google Trends as a full product providing insights into what people are searching for in the aggregate and make it available to everyone. This was one of the first projects for the newly established Google site in Israel, and our team worked closely with other teams across Google. Our focus was on large scale data analytics, so it was exciting to build something that shared our insights with the world.",
            "Simon: Do you remember what launching it was like? What were the reactions like? Yossi: Since the full public launch of Google Trends was  one of the first led by the Israel team — it felt like it really set a tone for what we would go on to do. I just remember it was exciting to be a part of this huge opportunity for learning and sharing about what people were interested in at large and small scales. I also remember being excited to see how Google Trends could be used to identify trends early — before they were huge, or how it could be used to predict what could happen as a result of something like a health outbreak or economic event. Simon: How have you seen this tool change? Were there any updates that stick out to you?Yossi: As Google Search has evolved, so has Google Trends, starting with daily trends and the ability to organize data into categories. We’ve also added more languages,  better visualizations and expanded trends to include new ways of searching, such as Image Search and videos. When Search started adapting to the semantic meaning of queries with our Knowledge Graph, Google Trends also brought entities to the tool so that Trends better reflects what people are interested in, regardless of the exact wording they used when searching. And as Search became fresher and more real-time, so did Trends — gaining insights on what’s trending “right now,” from sporting events to natural disasters.  Google Trends often reflect real-world phenomena in real-time and it’s become a basis for “nowcasting,” or predicting the present, for trends in economics, health and social sciences. Since its inception, we’ve seen Google Trends inform numerous papers across many research disciplines.Yossi: One thing I’m interested to hear from you is how you think journalists and researchers can best use Google Trends?Simon: The great thing about Trends is it’s the only tool out there that can give you both a real-time sense of what people actually care about as well as a view of how those trends have shifted over time. We’ve seen journalists use Trends to generate stories and to see what people want to know about the news to really compliment existing coverage.Yossi: I have to imagine working on Trends in 2020 was an unusual experience…Simon: It was an unforgettable year — but also one where Trends really felt like it helped us understand  the complex emotions and events we all went through. Health searches showed exactly what people were worried about as a result of the pandemic. And we also experienced the most-searched U.S. election in Google history, plus huge demonstrations around racial equity, which also showed up in Search. There was anxiety and insecurity around unemployment — which was searched at an all-time high. At the same time, we saw these really human searches around how to make things or how to help others.Yossi: Why do you still like working on Trends? What does it tell us about the world?Simon: It’s such a unique tool. It’s the world’s largest free-to-use dataset of its kind; it’s incredibly honest and reveals what people as a group really care about. There’s nothing like it."

            "Editor’s note: July is Bebe Moore Campbell National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. To bring awareness to mental health, Asad Abdullah II — a Google engineer, trauma-informed meditation instructor and mental health advocate — chatted with licensed psychologist Dr. Ghynecee Temple about mental health trends, how they affect communities of color and ways to cope.  Search interest for anxiety reached a record high across the U.S. this year. As we begin to reintegrate into life after an extended period of social distancing and self-isolation, people across the country are looking for ways to cope. Marginalized communities in particular have been disproportionately affected and continue to face challenges and stigmas when it comes to accessing resources and talking openly about mental wellbeing. According to Mental Health First Aid, 48% of White Americans with mental illness received mental health services, compared to 31% of Black Americans and Latino/Hispanic Americans and 22% of AAPI populations.Curious to talk more about the mental health trends we’re seeing for marginalized groups, I sat down with Dr. Ghynecee Temple of the Ladipo Group, a Black-owned company dedicated to the emotional wellness of Black and African-American people and communities. Dr. Temple sifted through these trends, discussed lingering mental health stigmas and shared ways we can take care of our wellbeing and support others.",
            "Search interest for “why do I feel anxious for no reason” spiked 400% in 2021 U.S. compared to 2020. How is this affecting communities of color specifically? There's always a reason you feel anxious, you just may not have uncovered it yet. For communities of color, both before and during the pandemic, there are unique experiences that affect their mental wellbeing. You may deal with navigating daily discrimination, feel a lack of autonomy being in a system that suppresses or grapple with intersecting identities.Fast forward to COVID-19, and you have a massive loss of control. You can’t see, smell or touch it, but it’s ever-looming and ever-present. So of course you’re going to feel anxious.Still in some communities, getting mental health help is stigmatized. What I tell people is: Your brain is your control center for your entire body. If your thoughts are off,  it's going to impact every facet of your functioning. And if something is off and not feeling right, why wouldn't we get help? As people prepare to return to work and school, what would you say to those who are experiencing uneasiness or anxiety? Your feelings about the transition are valid. Some people are excited to socialize again,  others are relieved as home may not always be the safest place for them, and still others are nervous about interacting with people outside of their bubble. Don’t judge your feelings, and accept that you’re going to experience different moods each day.What are some practical steps we can take to manage those feelings?There’s still a lot of uncertainty, but part of what we can do to weather that storm is to be present. Instead of thinking about what’s happening in two months or 12 months, ask yourself how you are feeling right now and what you need at this moment. Set boundaries and goals for yourself. For example, if you feel safer wearing a mask, continue to do so even if it’s not required. If you’re struggling with social anxiety, set a goal to socialize for 15 minutes at lunch before allowing yourself to go back to your desk to decompress. Exposure is one of the most helpful things to improve social anxiety. Start small and challenge yourself to build upon it every day.A lot of people are turning to therapy, and search interest for “black therapists” spiked last summer. How can people within the BIPOC community go about finding a therapist?A quick Google search will show you resources near you — and even a self-assessment to help you learn more about anxiety. When finding a therapist, many therapists will have an online bio where they can talk about their own identities that feel salient or what communities they’ve worked with before — start there. Then ask for a consultation and evaluate them for yourself. I love when new clients ask me questions! You don’t have to pick the first therapist you find. Remember that you’re shopping and want to feel comfortable and safe.I’m a Blue Dot Listener at Google. Our aim is to de-stigmatize mental health conversations in the workplace through allyship, peer support and education. I’d love to know from you, how we can be better mental health allies at work?As allies, we need to check our own beliefs and biases, and embrace a continuous posture of learning and unlearning. I’d also encourage people to know their limits. There are often instances where we try to support people, but it’s out of our scope. Know when to connect people to the right resources.You’ve been in the mental health space for almost a decade, what makes you hopeful for mental wellbeing for historically underrepresented groups?The fact that people are even searching for mental health topics is encouraging. It makes me hopeful that people are willing to learn and unlearn things."

But maybe you’ve found yourself wondering how Google connected those results to the words you typed, especially if you didn’t get exactly what you were expecting to find. Now, there’s a quick and easy way to see useful context about how Google returned results for your query, and to find helpful tips to get more out of Google Search. Starting today, when you visit an About This Result panel — the three dots next to most results — you’ll get even more information about your results to help you make sense of the information and figure out which result will be most useful.",
            "Relevant, useful resultsWith the vast amount of information available on the web, it would be nearly impossible to find what you need without some help sorting through it. Google’s Search systems are designed to do just that: sort through hundreds of billions of webpages to find the most relevant and reliable results, and present them in a helpful way. The way Google determines what is relevant and reliable information for a given query is based on a lot of different factors. While it can seem complex, some of these fundamental concepts are actually quite simple, and can be useful for people to understand when they start searching.Starting today, About This Result will show searchers information about some of these most important factors used by Google Search to connect results to their queries. Because just as these factors help Google decide if a result may be relevant, they may also help people decide what result is useful for them.",
            "We already give some visual indications of some of these relevance factors on the results page, but we’re now bringing this context to the About This Result panel, so people can easily evaluate whether a result might be the one they’re looking for. Here are some of the factors that you’ll see:Matching keywords: A simple, but important, factor Google uses to determine if information is relevant is when a webpage contains the same keywords as your search. Related terms: Google also looks for terms that our systems determined are related to the words in your query. If you search “how to cook fish in the oven,” we’ll also look for pages that have related terms like “bake” and “recipe.” Looking at links: When other pages link to a page using similar words as your query, that page might be relevant to your search. It can also be a helpful indicator of whether online content creators tend to regard the page as useful for that topic.Local relevance: Our systems also look at factors like the language you’re using to search as well as your country and location, to deliver content relevant for your area. For example, if you search \"what day is trash pickup?,” it’s helpful to get results that are applicable to your city or state.",
            "Get the most out of your searchSometimes, the results you see in Search might not be quite what you’re looking for. Now, the About This Result panel will also spotlight useful search tips to help Google better understand what you’re trying to find. The panel will show you search techniques or settings you can use to modify your search to get the results you’re after. For example, if you usually search in English, but want to find results in a different language, or from a different region, About This Result makes it even easier to adjust your settings. You may even want to adjust your search. Imagine you search for “best jogging shoes.” While it’s usually helpful for Google to return results about related concepts, in this case “running shoes,” you’re really after shoes that are optimized for jogging.",
            "About This Result will show you tips for how you can get to what you really wanted. For example, you can put quotes around a word or phrase to get results that mention those words exactly, or use a minus sign to exclude certain words from your search. This new tool is another helpful way to get more context about the results you’re seeing on Search. From being able to quickly check information about a source via About This Result to getting helpful notices if we feel results aren’t particularly relevant or if they’re rapidly changing, this set of features aims to help you find what you’re looking for and also be equipped to better evaluate the information that you find. This expansion of About This Result is rolling out in English in the U.S. to start, and we look forward to bringing this and other related features to more people in the coming months."

            "People around the world turn to Google Search to find information and make important decisions. We’re deeply committed to making sure you can do that safely and with the privacy you expect. Today, we’re announcing a new tool to add extra protection to the Search history saved to your Google Account. And we’re sharing a few reminders about the features we offer to keep your searches safer and more private.",
            "A new privacy protection for your Search history If your Web & App Activity setting is on, your Search history is saved to your account to enable more personalized experiences across Google services. You can view and delete that Search history any time at My Activity.But maybe you share a device, and want to make sure others who use it can’t go into My Activity and look at your Search history. Now, we’ve given you a way to put extra protection around the searches saved in your account. When you’re signed in, you can now choose to require extra verification for My Activity.",
            "With this setting, you’ll need to provide additional information — like your password or two-factor authentication — before your full history can be viewed.",
            "You’re in control It’s easy for you to control how you want your Search history to be saved to your Google Account — including if you don’t want it saved at all. With auto-delete controls, you can choose to have Google automatically and continuously delete your Search history, along with other Web & App Activity, from your account after three, 18 or 36 months. For new accounts, the default auto-delete option for Web & App Activity is 18 months, but you can always choose to update your settings if you’d like. You can also try out a new way to quickly delete your last 15 minutes of saved Search history with the single tap of a button. This feature is available in the Google app for iOS, and is coming to the Android Google app later this year.",
            "Security and privacy check-upsWe also offer a range of check-ups to make sure your settings and password practices are giving you the privacy and security you want.",
            "With a Privacy Checkup, we’ll walk you through key privacy settings step by step. When you’re finished, head over to Security Checkup for personalized recommendations to help protect your data and devices, like managing which third-party apps have access to your account data and learning if any of your passwords stored in Google Password Manager are weak. We also proactively notify you if we discover that any of these passwords have been compromised and   whether you’ve reused them across multiple sites.",
            "Private by designOne of the most important ways that Google works to keep your searches private is through encryption. When you search on Google, you get the same protection that banks use, so hackers and other malicious third parties can’t see what you’re searching for. We’ve used this technology for over a decade. And Google never sells the information about what you searched for to third parties.",
            "Secure by defaultIn addition to keeping your data private and secure, we also work to keep you safe while you’re browsing and searching for information on the web. Google Safe Browsing helps protect over four billion devices every day by showing people warnings when they attempt to navigate to dangerous sites or download dangerous files. We also notify webmasters when malicious actors compromise their websites, and we help them diagnose and resolve the problem so their visitors stay safer. And our teams and systems are hard at work keeping dangerous and malicious sites from showing up in Google Search. Every day, our systems detect over 40 billion pages of spam, which we block from appearing in Search. It’s all part of our work to make Google the safer way to search."

            "I live in the Pacific Northwest, a part of North America known for cooler weather and notoriously gray skies. So imagine my surprise when temperatures hit 116 degrees Fahrenheit over the past few days. And did I mention that, like many other PNWers, I don’t have air conditioning? Every morning lately, my Google Assistant delivers the slightly worrying news that the temperature is ticking up.The heat wave is all anyone here — and in other affected areas — can talk about. U.S. searches about heat waves and sunscreen reached all-time record highs this month, and “air conditioner installation service” spiked more than 2,150% over the same period of time. (To little surprise, search interest in air conditioning peaks every summer — but you can see it's been rising every year.)",
            "Since many of us are searching for this kind of information, I decided to take a trip down Ngrams lane to see how exactly we’ve talked about (er, I suppose “written about”) extreme summer weather over time. As a quick refresher, Ngrams was launched in 2009 by the Google Books team. The tool shows how books and other pieces of writing have used certain words or phrases over time, so you can see how popular (or unpopular) they’ve been throughout the years. I started with the classic “heat wave,” which has steadily risen over time. I also tried “a hot one,” and given how that phrase could apply to so many different use cases (outdoor temperatures but also meals, items, etc.), it’s been relatively steady.",
            "I decided to try “scorcher” and the more specific “summer scorcher.”",
            "The semi-consistent dips in “summer scorcher” suggest that the phrase was likely only used much...in the summer. But what about that huge peak in just plain “scorcher” in 1896? Below the graph, there’s an option to choose the time period from 1892 to 1897 and see how the word was used in books that have been uploaded to Google Books vast digital library. To my surprise, “scorcher” at this point in time didn’t refer to a tortuously hot day: In many cases, it was used to talk about someone who raced bicycles.",
            "So now when you hear someone say “today’s going to be a scorcher,” I hope you’ll also tell them about the word’s past life. As for me, I’m heading back to the search bar to learn more about another trending search that really hits home: “how to stay cool without ac.”"

            "Soda, pop; sweater, jumper; soccer, football. So many things go by different names. Sometimes it’s a function of language, but sometimes it’s a matter of cultural trends or nuance, or simply where you are in the world. One very relevant example is COVID-19. As people everywhere searched for information, we had to learn to identify all the different phrases people used to refer to the novel coronavirus to make sure we surfaced high quality and timely information from trusted health authorities like the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A year later, we’re encountering a similar challenge with vaccine names, only this time, we have a new tool to help: Multitask Unified Model (MUM).  Understanding searches for vaccine information AstraZeneca, CoronaVac, Moderna, Pfizer, Sputnik and other broadly distributed vaccines all have many different names all over the world — over 800, based on our analysis. People searching for information about the vaccines may look for “Coronavaccin Pfizer,” “mRNA-1273,” “CoVaccine” — the list goes on. Our ability to correctly identify all these names is critical to bringing people the latest trustworthy information about the vaccine. But identifying the different ways people refer to the vaccines all over the world is hugely time-intensive, taking hundreds of human hours. With MUM, we were able to identify over 800 variations of vaccine names in more than 50 languages in a matter of seconds. After validating MUM’s findings, we applied them to Google Search so that people could find timely, high-quality information about COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.",
            "Transferring knowledge across languagesMUM was able to do a job that should take weeks in just seconds thanks to its knowledge transfer skills. MUM can learn from and transfer knowledge across the 75+ languages it’s trained on. For example, imagine reading a book; if you’re multilingual, you’d be able to share the major takeaways of the book in the other languages you speak — depending on your fluency — because you have an understanding of the book that isn’t language- or translation-dependent. MUM transfers knowledge across languages much like this. Similarly, with its knowledge transfer abilities, MUM doesn’t have to learn a new capability or skill in every new language — it can transfer learnings across them, helping us quickly scale improvements even when there isn’t much training data to work with. This is in part thanks to MUM’s sample efficiencies — meaning MUM requires far fewer data inputs than previous models to accomplish the same task. In the case of vaccines, with just a small sample of official vaccine names, MUM was able to rapidly identify these variations across languages.  Improving Google Search with MUMThis first application of MUM helped us get critical information to users around the world in a timely manner, and we’re looking forward to the many ways in which MUM can make Search more useful to people in the future. Our early testing indicates that not only will MUM be able to improve many aspects of our existing systems, but will also help us create completely new ways to search and explore information."

            "Over the past two decades of building Google Search, we’ve continued to improve and refine our ability to provide the highest quality results for the billions of queries we see every day. Our core principles guide every improvement, as we constantly update Search to work better for you. One area we’d like to shed more light on is how we balance maximizing access to information with the responsibility to protect people from online harassment.We design our ranking systems to surface high quality results for as many queries as possible, but some types of queries are more susceptible to bad actors and require specialized solutions. One such example is websites that employ exploitative removals practices. These are sites that require payment to remove content, and since 2018 we’ve had a policy that enables people to request removal of pages with information about them from our results. Beyond removing these pages from appearing in Google Search, we also used these removals as a demotion signal in Search, so that sites that have these exploitative practices rank lower in results. This solution leads the industry, and is effective in helping people who are victims of harassment from these sites. However, we found that there are some extraordinary cases of repeated harassment. The New York Times highlighted one such case, and shed light on some limitations of our approach.To help people who are dealing with extraordinary cases of repeated harassment, we’re implementing an improvement to our approach to further protect known victims. Now, once someone has requested a removal from one site with predatory practices, we will automatically apply ranking protections to help prevent content from other similar low quality sites appearing in search results for people’s names. We’re also looking to expand these protections further, as part of our ongoing work in this space.This change was inspired by a similar approach we’ve taken with victims of non-consensual explicit content, commonly known as revenge porn. While no solution is perfect, our evaluations show that these changes meaningfully improve the quality of our results.Over the years of building Search, our approach has remained consistent: We take examples of queries where we’re not doing the best job in providing high quality results, and look for ways to make improvements to our algorithms. In this way, we don’t “fix” individual queries, since they’re often a symptom of a class of problems that affect many different queries. Our ability to address issues continues to lead the industry, and we’ve deployed advanced technology, tools and quality signals over the last two decades, making Search work better every day.Search is never a solved problem, and there are always new challenges we face as the web and the world change. We’re committed to listening to feedback and looking for ways to improve the quality of our results."

            "While over half of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated, vaccine uptake is slowing across the country. Research shows a variety of factors are preventing people from getting vaccinated — from physical access issues, like transportation challenges and not being able to take time off work, to concerns about safety and side effects. To help public health officials and researchers in the U.S. reach people facing these challenges, we’re introducing new tools to better understand the vaccination needs of a community. This builds on our work of providing data, insights and tools to public health, epidemiologists, researchers and policymakers since the early days of the pandemic.",
            "Equitable access to vaccinations For some people getting vaccinated is as simple as walking a few blocks to their local pharmacy. For others, it may be much more difficult and involve a long drive or navigating public transit. If public health officials, researchers and healthcare providers can identify areas where vaccination sites are inaccessible or hard to reach, they may be able to implement measures like pop-up vaccine sites or transportation support like ride vouchers.  Our COVID-19 Vaccination Access Dataset, which is available to the public today, calculates travel time to vaccination sites to identify areas where it may be difficult to reach a site whether someone is walking, driving or taking public transportation. We prepared this dataset using Google Maps Platform Directions API, the same API that powers navigation in Google Maps. This dataset does not contain any user data.This dataset will help power a new Vaccine Equity Planner dashboard from Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems innovation at Brigham & Women’s Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and  Boston Children’s Hospital, the primary pediatric teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School. This dashboard integrates our dataset with data from other organizations, such as the CDC’s social vulnerability index, to identify “vaccine deserts,” or areas where people have little or no convenient access to a vaccine site, to inform interventions such as pop-up clinics or new sites.",
            "Understanding vaccine information needs Public health organizations have been the go-to sources for authoritative information throughout the pandemic, and have provided educational campaigns about the safety, efficacy and availability of vaccines. We’ve heard from public health organizations and researchers that they want access to localized and timely data about what information their communities are seeking so they can tailor their communication to people not yet vaccinated. In the coming weeks, we’ll introduce a COVID-19 Vaccination Search Insights tool to help public health officials and researchers explore vaccine-related concerns and the information needs of local communities. The tool will show trends representing the relative search interests across three search categories: all vaccine information, intent to get vaccinated (such as eligibility, availability and sites), and safety and side effects. Insights will be provided at the county and zip code level and updated weekly.  The trends are based on aggregate and anonymized Google Search data so that no user information is included. The process to anonymize the COVID-19 Vaccination Search Insights is powered by differential privacy, a technique that adds noise to the data to provide privacy guarantees while preserving the overall quality of the data. The data can be compared across different regions and over time, without sharing the absolute number of queries in any given area.",
            "Both tools will initially be available in English and for the U.S. As we get more feedback from public health organizations, researchers, and the community at large, we’ll evaluate expanding these tools internationally.With these insights, we hope that public health organizations and healthcare providers can more easily and effectively reach their communities. Google will continue to do its part by providing timely and accurate vaccine information and appointment availability to people in Search and supporting organizations focused on vaccine equity."

            "Our computers, smartphones and apps are regularly updated to help make them better. The same thing happens with Google Search. In fact, Google Search is updated thousands of times a year to improve the experience and the quality of results. Here’s more on how that process works.Why updates are importantGoogle Search receives billions of queries every day from countries around the world in 150 languages. Our automated systems identify the most relevant and reliable information from hundreds of billions of pages in our index to help people find what they’re looking for. Delivering great results at this type of scale and complexity requires many different systems, and we’re always looking for ways to improve these systems so we can display the most useful results possible.Thanks to ongoing improvements, our evaluation processes show we’ve decreased the number of irrelevant results appearing on a search results page by over 40% over the past five years. Google sends billions of visits to websites each day, and by providing highly relevant results, we've been able to continue growing the traffic we send to sites every year since our founding.We also send visitors to a wide range of sites — more than 100 million every day — so we’re helping sites from across the web and around the world get discovered. As new sites emerge and the web changes, continued updates are key to ensuring we’re supporting a wide range of publishers, creators and businesses, while providing searchers with the best information available.How updates make Search betterHere are a few examples of what these updates look like:Last month we launched an improvement we made to help people find better product reviews through Search. We have an automated system that tries to determine if a review  seems to go beyond just sharing basic information about a product and instead demonstrates in-depth research or expertise. This helps people find high quality information from the content producers who are making it.Another example is an update we made several years ago that tries to determine if content is mobile-friendly. In situations where there are many possible matches with relatively equal relevancy, giving a preference to those that render better on mobile devices is more useful for users searching on those devices.In any given week, we might implement dozens of updates that are meant to improve Search in incremental ways. These are improvements that have been fully tested and evaluated through our rating process. People using Search generally don’t notice these updates, but Google gets a little better with each one. Collectively, they add up to help Search continue providing great results.Because there are so many incremental updates, it’s not useful for us to share details about all of them. However, we try to do so when we feel there is actionable information that site owners, content producers or others might consider applying, as was the case with both of the updates mentioned above.Core updates involve broad improvements to SearchPeriodically, we make more substantial improvements to our overall ranking processes. We refer to these as core updates, and they can produce some noticeable changes — though typically these are more often noticed by people actively running websites or performing search engine optimization (SEO) than ordinary users.This is why we give notice when these kinds of updates are coming. We want site owners to understand these changes aren't because of something they've done but rather because of how our systems have been improved to better assess content overall and better address user expectations. We also want to remind them that nothing in a core update (or any update) is specific to a particular site, but is rather about improving Search overall. As we’ve said previously in our guidance about this:There's nothing wrong with pages that may perform less well in a core update. They haven't violated our webmaster guidelines nor been subjected to manual or algorithmic action, as can happen to pages that do violate those guidelines. In fact, there's nothing in a core update that targets specific pages or sites. Instead, the changes are about improving how our systems assess content overall. These changes may cause some pages that were previously under-rewarded to do better.One way to think of how a core update operates is to imagine that in 2015 you made a list of the top 100 movies. A few years later in 2019, you refresh the list. It's going to naturally change. Some new and wonderful movies that never existed before will now be candidates for inclusion. You might also reassess some films and realize they deserved a higher place on the list than they had before.The list will change, and films previously higher on the list that move down aren't bad. There are simply more deserving films that are coming before them.",
            "Core updates are designed to increase the overall relevancy of our search results. In terms of traffic we send, it’s largely a net exchange. Some content might do less well, but other content gains. In the long term, improving our systems in this way is how we’ve continued to improve Search and send more traffic to sites across the web every year.How we help businesses and creators with guidance and tools While there’s nothing specific sites need to implement for core updates, we provide guidance and actionable advice that may help them be successful with Search overall. Following this guidance isn't a guarantee a site will rank well for every query it wants to. That’s not something Google or any other search engine could guarantee.Any particular query can have thousands of pages or other content that's all relevant in some way. It’s impossible to show all this content at the top of our results. And that wouldn’t be useful for searchers, who come to Search precisely because they expect us to show the most helpful information first.By following our core update guidance, businesses, site owners and content creators can help us better understand when they really have the most relevant and useful content to display. We also recommend sites follow our quality guidelines, implement our optimization tips and make use of the free Search Console tool that anyone can use.These kinds of updates, along with the tools and advice we offer, are how we make sure we keep connecting searchers to content creators, businesses and others who have the helpful information they’re looking for."

Nowhere is this clearer than at the core of our mission to make information more accessible and useful for everyone.We've spent more than two decades developing not just a better understanding of information on the web, but a better understanding of the world. Because when we understand information, we can make it more helpful — whether you’re a remote student learning a complex new subject, a caregiver looking for trusted information on COVID vaccines or a parent searching for the best route home.",
            "Deeper understanding with MUMOne of the hardest problems for search engines today is helping you with complex tasks — like planning what to do on a family outing. These often require multiple searches to get the information you need. In fact, we find that it takes people eight searches on average to complete complex tasks.With a new technology called Multitask Unified Model, or MUM, we're able to better understand much more complex questions and needs, so in the future, it will require fewer searches to get things done. Like BERT, MUM is built on a Transformer architecture, but it’s 1,000 times more powerful and can multitask in order to unlock information in new ways. MUM not only understands language, but also generates it. It’s trained across 75 different languages and many different tasks at once, allowing it to develop a more comprehensive understanding of information and world knowledge than previous models. And MUM is multimodal, so it understands information across text and images and in the future, can expand to more modalities like video and audio.Imagine a question like: “I’ve hiked Mt. Adams and now want to hike Mt. Fuji next fall, what should I do differently to prepare?” This would stump search engines today, but in the future, MUM could understand this complex task and generate a response, pointing to highly relevant results to dive deeper. We’ve already started internal pilots with MUM and are excited about its potential for improving Google products.",
            "Information comes to life with Lens and ARPeople come to Google to learn new things, and visuals can make all the difference. Google Lens lets you search what you see — from your camera, your photos or even your search bar. Today we’re seeing more than 3 billion searches with Lens every month, and an increasingly popular use case is learning. For example, many students might have schoolwork in a language they aren't very familiar with. That’s why we’re updating the Translate filter in Lens so it’s easy to copy, listen to or search translated text, helping students access education content from the web in over 100 languages.",

We recently announced we’re on track to launch over 100 AI-powered improvements to Google Maps by the end of year, and today, we’re introducing a few of the newest ones. Our new routing updates are designed to reduce the likelihood of hard-braking on your drive using machine learning and historical navigation information — which we believe could eliminate over 100 million hard-braking events in routes driven with Google Maps each year.If you’re looking for things to do, our more tailored map will spotlight relevant places based on time of day and whether or not you’re traveling. Enhancements to Live View and detailed street maps will help you explore and get a deep understanding of an area as quickly as possible.

Now, when you take a screenshot, Google Photos will prompt you to search the photo with Lens, so you can immediately shop for that item if you want. And on Chrome, we’ll help you keep track of shopping carts you’ve begun to fill, so you can easily resume your virtual shopping trip. We're also working with retailers to surface loyalty benefits for customers earlier, to help inform their decisions.Last year we made it free for merchants to sell their products on Google.

            "When I tell people I work on Google Search, I’m sometimes asked, \"Is there any work left to be done?\" The short answer is an emphatic “Yes!” There are countless challenges we're trying to solve so Google Search works better for you. Today, we’re sharing how we're addressing one many of us can identify with: having to type out many queries and perform many searches to get the answer you need.Take this scenario: You’ve hiked Mt. Adams. Now you want to hike Mt. Fuji next fall, and you want to know what to do differently to prepare. Today, Google could help you with this, but it would take many thoughtfully considered searches — you’d have to search for the elevation of each mountain, the average temperature in the fall, difficulty of the hiking trails, the right gear to use, and more. After a number of searches, you’d eventually be able to get the answer you need.But if you were talking to a hiking expert; you could ask one question — “what should I do differently to prepare?” You’d get a thoughtful answer that takes into account the nuances of your task at hand and guides you through the many things to consider.  This example is not unique — many of us tackle all sorts of tasks that require multiple steps with Google every day. In fact, we find that people issue eight queries on average for complex tasks like this one. Today's search engines aren't quite sophisticated enough to answer the way an expert would. But with a new technology called Multitask Unified Model, or MUM, we're getting closer to helping you with these types of complex needs. So in the future, you’ll need fewer searches to get things done. Helping you when there isn’t a simple answerMUM has the potential to transform how Google helps you with complex tasks. MUM uses the T5 text-to-text framework and is 1,000 times more powerful than BERT. MUM not only understands language, but also generates it. It’s trained across 75 different languages and many different tasks at once, allowing it to develop a more comprehensive understanding of information and world knowledge than previous models. And MUM is multimodal, so it understands information across text and images and, in the future, can expand to more modalities like video and audio.Take the question about hiking Mt. Fuji: MUM could understand you’re comparing two mountains, so elevation and trail information may be relevant. It could also understand that, in the context of hiking, to “prepare” could include things like fitness training as well as finding the right gear.",
            "Since MUM can surface insights based on its deep knowledge of the world, it could highlight that while both mountains are roughly the same elevation, fall is the rainy season on Mt. Fuji so you might need a waterproof jacket. MUM could also surface helpful subtopics for deeper exploration — like the top-rated gear or best training exercises — with pointers to helpful articles, videos and images from across the web. Removing language barriersLanguage can be a significant barrier to accessing information. MUM has the potential to break down these boundaries by transferring knowledge across languages. It can learn from sources that aren’t written in the language you wrote your search in, and help bring that information to you. Say there’s really helpful information about Mt. Fuji written in Japanese; today, you probably won’t find it if you don’t search in Japanese. But MUM could transfer knowledge from sources across languages, and use those insights to find the most relevant results in your preferred language. So in the future, when you’re searching for information about visiting Mt. Fuji, you might see results like where to enjoy the best views of the mountain, onsen in the area and popular souvenir shops — all information more commonly found when searching in Japanese.",
            "Understanding information across typesMUM is multimodal, which means it can understand information from different formats like webpages, pictures and more, simultaneously. Eventually, you might be able to take a photo of your hiking boots and ask, “can I use these to hike Mt. Fuji?” MUM would understand the image and connect it with your question to let you know your boots would work just fine. It could then point you to a blog with a list of recommended gear.",
            "Applying advanced AI to Search, responsiblyWhenever we take a leap forward with AI to make the world’s information more accessible, we do so responsibly. Every improvement to Google Search undergoes a rigorous evaluation process to ensure we’re providing more relevant, helpful results. Human raters, who follow our Search Quality Rater Guidelines, help us understand how well our results help people find information. Just as we’ve carefully tested the many applications of BERT launched since 2019, MUM will undergo the same process as we apply these models in Search. Specifically, we’ll look for patterns that may indicate bias in machine learning to avoid introducing bias into our systems. We’ll also apply learnings from our latest research on how to reduce the carbon footprint of training systems like MUM, to make sure Search keeps running as efficiently as possible.We’ll bring MUM-powered features and improvements to our products in the coming months and years. Though we’re in the early days of exploring MUM, it’s an important milestone toward a future where Google can understand all of the different ways people naturally communicate and interpret information."

            "You know that exhaustion you’re feeling — the one that no amount of espresso shots or power naps can remedy? Well, it turns out you’re not alone. Last month in the U.S. we saw spikes in fatigue-related Google searches, and the question “why do I feel bad?” reached a record high. There’s a collective feeling of exhaustion, and we’re all looking for ways to cope with it. Over the past year, we’ve seen an increase in searches related to meditation, virtual therapy, walking and digital detoxes. Since this week marks the beginning of Mental Health Awareness Month in the U.S., we chatted with two of Google’s experts on the topic: Dr. David Feinberg, a psychiatrist by training and head of Google Health, and Dr. Jessica DiVento, a licensed clinical psychologist and the Chief Mental Health Advisor for YouTube. David and Jessica talk about why we’re feeling this way and what we can do about it. What’s going on with our collective wellbeing at this moment in time? Jessica: Our body’s threat detection system is working in overdrive. We’re constantly making sense of what’s happening so we know what’s causing us stress and can react to it. People don’t realize how much mental energy that takes. Even though you might not be doing much physically, it makes sense to feel fatigued. In the U.S., more people are getting vaccinated and guidelines are changing. Adjusting to this new routine takes a lot of cognitive processing. David: It's a hard transition. Our bodies are good at achieving homeostasis. I’ve become comfortable working from home, eating outside and socializing within my pod — these are abnormal things that I’ve incorporated as normal. In parts of the world, you’re telling me to go back to my old ways. Things that used to require minimal thinking — like meeting a friend for dinner — now require so much processing. How do you expect people’s emotions to change over the coming months? David: Fear is when you open the door and a bear is there. Anxiety is when there’s no bear and you don’t know why you’re feeling that way. We’ve been in a constant state of both with the pandemic. Already, I’ve felt a bit of these heavy feelings lift. When I got my first shot of the vaccine at CVS I felt some of the anxiety and fear I was carrying release — it was almost a spiritual experience. This is a dramatic life experience. It will be part of our narrative and change how we respond to things. When a vase falls and it breaks, you glue it back together. When it falls again it usually breaks in the same spot. When there are triggers — like seeing spikes in India — it brings back emotions from this collective trauma. Jessica: As a global society, there’s a long way to go. Some of us going through the reconstruction phase will ask, “Why am I not feeling better yet?” Transitioning out of this will take time. What have you both done to maintain your own mental health?Jessica: We know all the things to do to minimize stress and anxiety: eat well, exercise, sleep and so on. We also know what doesn’t help. For me, that’s the overconsumption of technology. Digital wellbeing features, like Pixel’s Flip to Shhh and app timers, help me stop scrolling so I can be more present.David: I’ve focused on my sleep. Dreams are a way to consolidate new information. I’ve measured my sleep with my Fitbit smartwatch and now with Sleep Sensing on my new Nest Hub, and have learned that eating or working out late at night negatively affects my sleep. So I’ve made adjustments.As more people search for ways to cope, what are Google and YouTube doing to help?David: Part of coping with anxiety is researching and taking action on the things you can control.  I love seeing Google connect people to actionable information through things like our mental health self-assessments, information on vaccination and testing locations, and authoritative data about things like symptoms and guidelines to stay safe.  Jessica: The rise in searches for mental health content shows that it’s becoming okay to say that you’re not okay. The more conversations we spark and the more places we share content about mental health, the less stigma there will be. At YouTube, we work closely with experts in the mental health space to make sure there are credible and engaging videos out there. When someone searches specifically for anxiety or depression resources, we’ll show information about symptoms, treatment resources and self-assessments. And for searches that may indicate someone in crisis, we’re committed to connecting them with free 24/7 crisis support resources. Also, Fitbit recently teamed up with Deepak Chopra to create an exclusive wellness collection for its Premium members, making it easier for them to create a mindfulness practice. Things like that help make sure anyone can take care of their mental health and wellbeing. I hope that lives on past this moment. What questions do you hope the world is searching for in the next six months?  Jessica: I think we’ll see people searching for ways they can help others — looking at careers in counseling and epidemiology — and how they can keep leaning into wellbeing. David: I hope people are searching “Am I in love?” and “Why do I feel great?”"

            "The web is home to a lot of great things. But it is also a place where bad actors can try to take advantage of you or access your personal information. That's why we're always working to keep you safe while you search, and also to give you the tools to take control of your Search experience.  Here are five ways we're making Google the safer way to search: 1. Fighting spam",
            "The last thing you want to worry about when you’re looking for cake recipes or researching a work project is landing on a malicious website where your identity might get stolen. It’s our job to help protect you from that, and it’s one we take very seriously. In 2020, we detected 40 billion pages of spam every day — including sites that have been hacked or deceptively created to steal your personal information — and blocked them from appearing in your results. Beyond traditional webspam, we’ve expanded our effort to protect you against other types of abuse like scams and fraud. Since 2018, we’ve been able to protect hundreds of millions of searches a year from ending up on scammy sites that try to deceive you with keyword stuffing, logos of brands they're imitating or a scam phone number they want you to call. We’re also providing web creators with resources to understand potential website vulnerabilities and better protect their sites, as well as tools to see if their sites have been hacked. This work is helping the entire web stay safer, and making it easier for you to land on safe sites with great experiences. To learn more about our work to fight spam on Search, read our 2020 Webspam Report.2. Encrypting searches We also safeguard you from more than spam. We use encryption to prevent hackers and unwanted third parties from seeing what you are looking up or accessing your information. All searches made on google.com or in the Google app are protected by encrypting the connection between your device and Google, keeping your information safer.  3. Helping you learn more about your results before you click Another way we protect users is by giving you the tools and context to learn more about your Search results. Let’s say you’re searching for something and find a result from a source you aren’t familiar with. By clicking on the three dots next to your result, you can see website descriptions, when Google first indexed the site, and whether or not a site’s connection is secure. This added context enables you to make a more informed decision about the source before clicking the blue link.4. Browsing safely Sometimes in the excitement of trying to learn more about a topic, you end up clicking on a link to a dangerous site without even realizing it. But with Google Safe Browsing, we’ve got you covered. This feature currently protects over four billion devices and when enabled in Chrome, displays warning messages letting you know that the site you are trying to enter might be unsafe, protecting you and your personal information from potential malware and phishing scams. 5. Protecting you from bad adsProviding you access to high-quality and reliable information on Search also extends to the ads you see while searching for products, services and content. To ensure those ads aren’t scams or being misused, we are constantly developing and enforcing policies that put users first. In 2020, we blocked or removed approximately 3.1 billion ads for violating our policies and restricted an additional 6.4 billion ads, across all of our platforms including Search. All of these tools were created with you in mind, so you can click on that carrot cake recipe knowing that we are working hard to help keep you safe online."

            "Photo by Sthanlee b. Mirador, 2017As a Filipino American born and raised in the Bay Area, I was lucky to easily find people who looked like me. From historic neighborhoods like SOMA Pilipinas and Japantown to the Bay’s deep roots in Black and Latinx culture, I found diversity in people, culture and food. I saw fewer people who looked like me in mainstream media like TV shows, magazines or music videos. How could I be surrounded by so much diversity, especially within my own Asian American community, that wasn’t reflected in the shows I watched or my favorite songs? Where was our story?Fortunately, today looks different. I’ve seen Filipino artists go platinum, reach millions of YouTube views and become household names.Still, there are so many Asian American stories unheard and undiscovered. I’m still searching for storytellers who look like me, and stories that sound like mine.Richie, who also goes by his DJ name TRAKTIVIST, knows what I’m talking about. Richie is a Filipino American Bay Area native like myself.  “I was born in Daly City, grew up as a DJ, and joined a mobile DJ crew around the time when there was a scene for Filipino DJs,” he says proudly. Daly City is nine miles south of San Francisco and nearly 58% of its population identifies as Asian.",
            "“As a DJ you realize you play so much stuff that's on the radio,” he says. “But at some point you realize there's so much music coming out of our community. Why am I not playing that? Why am I not looking for that?”  The Asian American community has faced erasure from popular American narratives and history, and are largely absent from mainstream American media. Partly because of this, Asians in America are seen as a monolith. “When I grew up, being Asian wasn't something that most of us were told to be proud of,” Richie says. This is why Richie spent over a year building TRAKTIVIST.com, a discovery platform dedicated to helping people find music made by Asian North Americans. TRAKTIVIST.com’s catalog also allows people to search for music by filtering ethnicity, instrument, genre and playlists.",
            "“I was trying to figure out who's who and where do they exist? [It starts with] who you know, who people know, but after that, I had to turn to the internet. It was a search.” Richie used Google tools, starting with Search, to find and compile artists. While it was easier to find current musicians, it was challenging to find Asian American artists from the past. He dove deep into archives of forums, blogs, social media, websites and YouTube to find artists and their stories. Through Google Search, Richie and his TRAKTIVIST.com team have discovered over 1,500 Asian American artists across numerous decades and genres, and continue to use Google tools to search for the undiscovered. Richie is committed to surfacing overlooked or forgotten stories. He recently published “Grammy Firsts,” a collection celebrating Asian American firsts of the awards show. And with Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage month approaching, we asked Richie to create a playlist celebrating the diversity of Asian American stories and artists — which he graciously did. Talking to Richie, I find myself coming back to a word that we center the Filipino Googler Network, an employee resource group, around: kapamilya, or belonging. Through music, I hope we can find kapamilya, be able to see one another, find ourselves and have our stories be heard. With the recent rise in anti-Asian sentiment and violence in America, Richie has found the music he’s discovering to be a source of healing. “When we think about our communities and what we go through…” Richie says, “...whether through film, TV poetry, music, any art form, all of it matters. My job is to make sure these stories get broadcast and receive as much attention as possible.”"

            "We all need a bit of escapism sometimes, and there’s nothing like a blast from the pop-culture past to do the trick. Today, we’re bringing characters from classic Japanese anime, games and TV shows to life — from Pac-Man to Hello Kitty — with augmented reality (AR) in Search. Japan’s anime and video game culture emerged between the 1950s and the 1980s, as comic books, gaming arcades and home TVs and consoles boomed. But it wasn’t just a Japanese phenomenon. The most iconic characters caught people’s imaginations around the world, and they’re still hugely popular today. Which animated icon is most searched on Google? Pac-Man leads the pack by a long way: worldwide search interest in the hungry dot-gobbler is more than double the next most-searched character, Hello Kitty. What might surprise you is that the top country for search interest in Pac-Man over the past five years was...Peru. Hello Kitty is most searched in the Philippines. When it comes to the broader trends, anime wins out. It’s more popular than video games worldwide, with interest for anime climbing to its highest peak on record in the past month. That’s pretty amazing — and in fact, search interest for “anime sugoi” (or “anime is amazing”) has spiked 2,300% in the past five years globally.",
            "Now, you can have these characters do their cute thing right in front of your eyes. Take a break to watch ghosts chasing after Pac-Man or Gundam swoop in your living room! Characters that are viewable in AR include Evangelion, Hello Kitty, Gomora, Gundam, Pac-Man and Ultraman. (For die-hard otaku who can read Japanese, check out our Japanese blog with the full list.)",
            "How to access and share:Search for one of the characters on Google using a mobile device and tap “View in 3D” to rotate or zoom in and see it up close. You can then bring the characters from outer space into your space with AR and turn up your volume to hear Hello Kitty deliver a cute message, or Pac-man's retro sound effects.Android: Search for “Hello Kitty” or one of the 14 characters on the Google app or any Android browser and tap “View in 3D.” You can see 3D content on devices with Android 7 Plus and you can see AR content on ARCore-enabled devices.iOS:  Search for “Hello Kitty” or one of the 14 characters on the Google app. 3D and AR content is available on iOS 11.0+ devices.You can also create AR videos — or recreate your favorite scenes — with the recording option. Don’t forget to tag your photos and videos on social with #Google3D."

            "Access to information is at the core of Google’s mission, and every day we work to make information from the web available to everyone. We design our systems to return the most relevant and reliable information possible, but our search results include pages from the open web. Depending on what you search for, the results can include content that people might find objectionable or offensive.While we’re committed to providing open access to information, we also have a strong commitment and responsibility to comply with the law and protect our users. When content is against local law, we remove it from being accessible in Google Search. Overall, our approach to information quality and webpage removals aims to strike a balance between ensuring that people have access to the information they need, while also doing our best to protect against harmful information online. Here’s an overview of how we do that.",
            "Complying with the lawWe hold ourselves to a high standard when it comes to our legal requirements to remove pages from Google search results. For many issues, such as privacy or defamation, our legal obligations may vary country by country, as different jurisdictions have come to different conclusions about how to deal with these complex topics.We encourage people and authorities to alert us to content they believe violates the law. In fact, in most cases, this is necessary, because determining whether content is illegal is not always a determination that Google is equipped to make, especially without notice from those who are affected. For example, in the case of copyrighted material, we can’t automatically confirm whether a given page hosting that particular content has a license to do so, so we need rightsholders to tell us. By contrast, the mere presence of child sex abuse material (CSAM) on a page is illegal in most jurisdictions, so we develop ways to automatically identify that content and prevent it from showing in our results.In the case of all legal removals, we share information about government requests for removal in our Transparency Report. Where possible, we inform website owners about requests for removal via Search Console.",
            "Voluntary removal policiesBeyond removing content as required by law, we also have a set of policies that go beyond what’s legally required, mostly focused on highly personal content appearing on the open web. Examples of this content include financial or medical information, government-issued IDs, and intimate imagery published without consent.These types of content are information that people generally intend to keep private and can cause serious harm, like identity theft, so we give people the ability to request removal from our search results.We also look for new ways to carefully expand these policies to allow further protections for people online. For example, we allow people to request the removal of pages about themselves on sites with exploitative removals policies, as well as pages that include contact information alongside personal threats, a form of “doxxing.” In these cases, while people may want to access these sites to find potentially useful information or understand their policies and practices, the pages themselves provide little value or public interest, and might lead to reputational or even physical harm that we aim to help protect against.",
            "Solving issues at scaleIt might seem intuitive to solve content problems by removing more content — either page by page, or by limiting access to entire sites. However, in addition to being in tension with our mission, this approach also doesn’t effectively scale to the size of the open web, with trillions of pages and more being added each minute. Building scalable, automated approaches allows us to not only solve these challenges more effectively, but also avoid unnecessarily limiting access to legal content online.Our most effective protection is to design systems that rank high-quality, reliable information at the top of our results. And while we do remove pages in compliance with our policies and legal obligations, we also use insights from those removals to improve our systems overall.For example, when we receive a high volume of valid copyright removal requests from a given site, we are able to use that as a quality signal and demote the site in our results. We’ve developed similar approaches for sites whose pages we’ve removed under our voluntary policies. This allows us to not only help the people requesting the removals, but also scalably fight against the issue in other cases.",
            "An evolving webUltimately, it’s important to remember that even when we remove content from Google Search, it may still exist on the web, and only a website owner can remove content entirely. But we do fight against the harmful effects of sensitive personal information appearing in our results, and have strict practices to ensure we’re complying with the law. We’re always evolving our approach to protect against bad actors on the web and ensure Google continues to deliver high-quality, reliable information for everyone. Beyond how we handle removals of web pages, if you’d like to learn more about how we approach our policies for search features, visit this post.

Over the past year or so of quarantine, I've found myself searching for new things to do. I searched for “cheesemaking” when my kids asked me to play sous chef, and for “bird watching” and “how to create container gardens” when we started spending more time outside.  Like so many people, I looked up recipes for baking bread. My quarantine search history feels like a bingo card for hobbies. This made me wonder what other people were searching for during the pandemic — and  how have these interests changed over time? To get an idea, we worked with design studio Polygraph (creators of The Pudding) to create a new interactive tool that allows us to dig deeper into what captivated our year of social distancing.

            "La pandemia de COVID-19. Elecciones alrededor del mundo. Los verificadores de hechos han tenido un año ajetreado. Más de 50.000 verificaciones de hechos aparecieron en la Búsqueda de Google el último año y recibieron aproximadamente 2.400 millones de impresiones en la Búsqueda de Google en dicho tiempo.Una investigación externa sugiere que las verificaciones de hechos son efectivas para corregir percepciones erróneas. En un nuevo informe publicado hoy y con el apoyo de Google News Initiative, los investigadores Ethan Porter, Thomas Wood y Yamil Velez encontraron que las correcciones en forma de la verificación de hechos eliminan los efectos de la información falsa en torno a las creencias sobre la vacuna para COVID-19.Sin embargo, la verificación de hechos no es sólo para los profesionales. Todos los días, las personas buscan evidencia para confirmar o refutar un hecho sobre el que tienen dudas. Durante los últimos 12 meses, el número de búsquedas de Google para \"es cierto que ...\" fue mayor que para \"cómo hacer pan\", y eso es significativo dada la locura por la masa madre del año pasado. Estamos comprometidos en apoyar a todos los usuarios en su búsqueda de información correcta en línea y a compartir nuestros aprendizajes con otras organizaciones para fortalecer la verificación de hechos.Con eso en mente, y en el marco de la celebración del “Día Internacional de la Verificación de Hechos” que se celebra el 2 de abril, compartimos cinco consejos simples que te ayudarán a realizar las preguntas correctas y detectar información errónea en línea. 1. Obtén más información sobre la fuente ¿Alguna vez te has encontrado con una historia sorprendente de un sitio web del que nunca has oído hablar? Primero, revisa si la fuente en sí es correcta. Puedes simplemente buscar el nombre del sitio web, pero si quieres ver sólo lo que otros tienen que decir al respecto, solicita a Google que elimine los resultados del dominio en sí. La consulta se vería así:  -site:youtube.com. ¿Quieres refinar tu búsqueda aún más? Encuentra más consejos en nuestra página de soporte. 2. Comprueba si una imagen se está utilizando en el contexto correctoUna imagen habla más que mil palabras, como dice el viejo adagio. Pero una imagen también se puede sacar de contexto o editar para confundir. Puedes buscar con una imagen haciendo clic con el botón derecho en una foto y seleccionando \"Buscar imagen en Google\". Puedes hacer lo mismo en el móvil tocando y manteniendo presionada la imagen. Esto buscará la imagen para verificar si ha aparecido en línea antes y en qué contexto, para que puedas ver si se ha alterado su significado original.",
            "3. Busca la cobertura de noticias¿Qué es mejor que una fuente? ¡Varias! Ve cómo (y si acaso) diferentes medios de noticias han informado sobre el mismo evento para que puedas obtener un panorama completo. Cambia al modo de noticias o busca un tema en news.google.com. Asegúrate de hacer clic en \"Cobertura total\" si la opción está disponible.",
            "4. Consulta a los verificadores de hechosLos verificadores de hechos pueden haber abordado esa historia aleatoria que tu familiar te envió en el chat grupal, o una similar que te guiará en la dirección correcta para encontrar lo que realmente sucedió. Intenta buscar el tema en el Explorador de verificación de hechos, que recopila más de 100.000 verificaciones de hechos de medios acreditados alrededor del mundo.",
            "5. Utiliza Google Earth o Street View para verificar la locación.Los eventos que suceden en lugares lejanos pueden engañarte o confundirte de manera particularmente fácil. Si la historia que estás leyendo tiene imágenes del evento que te interesa, o cualquier forma de descripción visual, busca ese lugar en Google Earth o en Street View en Google Maps. Digamos que tu amigo te envía una historia sobre Bigfoot paseando por la Torre Eiffel en París, Francia. Buscar por “Torre Eiffel” en Street View al menos te confirma que la torre no tiene un sombrero grande rojo de baquero en la punta (como sucede en Paris, Texas). Si esa parte no funciona, el resto de la historia puede ser sospechosa también.",
            "Estamos comprometidos en ayudar a las personas a detectar información errónea en línea y en apoyar el ecosistema de verificación de datos.Recientemente entregamos  3 millones de dólares a esfuerzos periodísticos enfocados en verificación de datos de información falsa sobre el proceso de inmunización de COVID-19, con un foco especial en proyectos que tienen como objetivo alcanzar audiencias poco representadas.

            "The COVID-19 pandemic. Elections around the world. Fact-checkers worldwide have had a busy year. More than 50,000 new fact checks surfaced on Google Search over the past year, with all fact checks receiving more than 2.4 billion impressions in Search in that timeframe. A growing body of external research suggests that fact checks can help counter falsehoods. In a new report supported by the Google News Initiative published today, researchers Ethan Porter, Thomas Wood and Yamil Velez found that corrections in the form of fact checks reduce the effects of misinformation on beliefs about the COVID-19 vaccine.Fact-checking isn’t just for the professionals, however. Every day, people seek evidence to confirm or refute a piece of information they’re uncertain about. Over the past 12 months, Google searches for “is it true that...” were higher than “how to make bread,” and that’s saying something given last year’s sourdough craze. We're committed to supporting all users as they look for reliable information online, and sharing our insights with other organizations to strengthen fact checking.With that in mind, and ahead of International Fact Checking Day on April 2, here are five simple tips to help you ask the right questions so you can better spot misinformation online. 1. Find out more about the source. Have you ever stumbled across a surprising story from a website you’ve never heard of? First, see whether the source itself checks out.  After searching for the website, you can tap on its menu icon to learn more about the result (in English in the United States only, for now).",
            "If you click on the result, you can see how the site describes itself on its “About” page, but you may want to get a second opinion. You can do that by asking Google to remove results from the domain itself. The query would look something like this: about youtube -site:youtube.com. Want to refine your search even further? Find more tips on our support page. 2. Check if an image is being used in the right context.A picture is worth 1000 words, as the old adage goes. But a picture can also be taken out of context or edited to mislead. You can search with an image by right clicking on a photo and selecting “Search Google for Image.” You can do the same on mobile by touching and holding the image. This will look for the picture to check if it has appeared online before, and in what context, so you can see if it has been altered from its original meaning.",
            "3. Look for news coverage. What’s better than one source? Several! See how (and whether) different news outlets have reported on the same event so that you can get the full picture. Switch to news mode or search for a topic in news.google.com. Make sure to click through to “Full Coverage” if the option is available.",
            "4. Consult the fact-checkers.Fact-checkers may have addressed that random story your relative sent you in the group chat – or a similar one that will point you in the right direction to find out what really happened. Try searching for the topic in the Fact Check Explorer, which collects more than 100,000 fact checks from reputable publishers around the world.",
            "5. Use Google Maps, Earth or Street View to verify the location. False stories about events happening in far-off places can spread due to our lack of familiarity with their location. If you want to get a sense of whether a photo is actually from the place it claims to be from, try checking Google Earth or look at the Street View of a location on Google Maps.Say your friend sends you a story about Bigfoot strolling by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. Searching for the Eiffel Tower on Street View will at the very least confirm that the tower doesn’t have a big red cowboy hat at the top (like it does in Paris, Texas). If that part doesn’t check out, the rest of the story might be fishy, too.",
            "We’re committed to helping people spot misinformation online and supporting the fact-checking ecosystem. Most recently, we provided $3 million to journalistic efforts fact-checking misinformation about the COVID-19 immunization process, with a concentration on projects that aim to reach audiences underserved by fact-checking. We also launched a GNI University Verification Challenge across Asia to help the verification skills among journalism students. In addition, Google.org helped the nonprofit Full Fact through grant funding and seven full-time pro-bono engineering fellows to boost the number of claims they could detect.For more tips and best practices, check out the resources put together by the International Fact-Checking Network at factcheckingday.com.

            "You’d hardly know it from the way Google Search works, but nearly 20 years after introducing our first spell-check system, spelling remains an ongoing challenge of language understanding. Before we can even begin to start looking for relevant results for a search query, we have to know what a user is looking for, spelled correctly. But every day, one out of 10 search queries is misspelled, and new words are constantly being introduced, along with new ways to misspell them. If you’ve ever been guilty of misspelling a search only to get what you were looking for anyway, read on to learn more about the ABCs of spelling in Google Search. A is for All about common spelling mistakesOur spelling mistakes tend to fall into two main categories: conceptual and slip-of-finger mistakes. We make conceptual mistakes when we’re unsure of how to spell something and try to take our best guess. Say you want to look up the meaning of “gobbledygook” and you don’t know exactly how to spell it, which wouldn’t be unusual since it’s both a difficult to spell word and has two commonly accepted spellings, including “gobbledegook.” In this case, we’ll see many best-effort spellings of the word like “garbledygook,” “gobblydegook,” “gobbleygook,” “gobbly gook,” and more.",
            "Slip-of-finger spelling errors happen when we know how to spell what we’re looking for, but accidentally mistype it. Most of us have probably experienced this, especially since the rise of the smartphone, but it happens when we’re typing on full-size keyboards, too. This is why we see over 10,000 variations of queries like “YouTube,” all made by the accidental slip of a finger, such as “ytoube,” “7outub,” “yoitubd” and “tourube.”",
            "B is for Better models to solve for the unknownDespite how common our mistakes are, many misspelled queries appear only once, making spelling a unique challenge for Search. And regardless of what kind of spelling error was made, our systems find ways to understand what you mean. Previously, to solve for these never-before-seen misspellings, our systems found inspiration in the keyboard design. For example, if you tried to type \"u\" but made a mistake, our systems learned you were more likely to have typed \"y\" than \"z\" because \"y\" is adjacent to \"u\" on a standard English language keyboard. Our models applied the general concept to all new misspellings, walking down nearby letter replacements until a popular replacement term was identified. While this may have seemed like an obvious way to solve for slip-of-finger mistakes, this general approach effectively corrected all kinds of spelling errors, including conceptual mistakes. Thanks to advancements in deep learning, we now have a better way to understand spelling. Late last year, we announced a new spelling algorithm that uses a deep neural net that better models and learns from less-common and unique spelling mistakes. This advancement enables us to run a model with more than 680 million parameters in under two milliseconds — a very large model that works faster than the flap of a hummingbird’s wings — so people can search uninterrupted by their own spelling errors. And how do our systems know what someone is looking for, no matter the type of mistake and if we’ve never seen the misspelling before? This is where context comes into play. Our natural language understanding models look at a search in context, like the relationship that words and letters within the query have to each other. Our systems start by deciphering or trying to understand your entire search query first. From there, we generate the best replacements for the misspelled words in the query based on our overall understanding of what you’re looking for. For example, we can tell from the other words in the query “average home coast” that you’re probably looking for information on “average home cost.” C is for Correcting your query — nicelyYou might see these spelling technologies pop up in Google Search in different ways. When we’re pretty sure we know what you’re looking for, we may politely ask, “did you mean…” and show the alternative we think you intended to search for. When we’re very confident that we’ve correctly identified your misspelling, we’ll automatically show results for what we think you’re looking for -- but we’ll always let you know and provide a way to get back to your original spelling. And whether you take our suggestion or not, we’re constantly learning and improving our systems based on that feedback to make Search more helpful.So whether you’re a spelling bee champ or can't quite nail “I before E except after C,” we'll always be working to improve our spelling so you can keep searching."

As practitioners across the search industry have noted, this claim relies on flawed methodology that misunderstands how people use Search. In reality, Google Search sends billions of clicks to websites every day, and we’ve sent more traffic to the open web every year since Google was first created. And beyond just traffic, we also connect people with businesses in a wide variety of ways through Search, such as enabling a phone call to a business. To set the record straight, we wanted to provide important context about this misleading claim.",
            "How people use Search People use Search to find a wide range of information, and billions of times per day, Google Search sends someone to a website. But not every query results in a click to a website, and there are a lot of very good reasons why:People reformulate their queriesPeople don’t always know how to word their queries when they begin searching. They might start with a broad search, like “sneakers” and, after reviewing results, realize that they actually wanted to find “black sneakers.” In this case, these searches would be considered a “zero-click” — because the search didn’t result immediately in a click to a website. In the case of shopping for sneakers, it may take a few “zero-click” searches to get there, but if someone ultimately ends up on a retailer site and makes a purchase, Google has delivered a qualified visitor to that site, less likely to bounce back dissatisfied.Because this happens so frequently, we offer many features (like “related searches” links) to help people formulate their searches and get to the most helpful result, which is often on a website.People look for quick factsPeople look for quick, factual information, like weather forecasts, sports scores, currency conversions, the time in different locations and more. As many search engines do, we provide this information directly on the results page, drawing from licensing agreements or tools we’ve developed. These results are helpful for users, and part of our ongoing work to make Google Search better every day. In 2020, for example, we showed factual information about important topics like COVID and the U.S. elections, which generated some of the most interest we’ve ever seen on Search. Our elections results feature was seen billions of times, delivering high-quality information in real time as people awaited the outcome. We also provided factual information about COVID symptoms in partnership with the WHO and local health authorities, making critical information readily accessible and upholding our responsibility to fight against potential misinformation online. People connect with a business directlyWhen it comes to local businesses, we provide many ways for consumers to connect directly with businesses through Google Search, many of which don’t require a traditional click. As an example, people might search for business hours, then drive to the store after confirming a location is open. Or they find restaurants on Google and call for information or to place an order, using phone numbers we list. On average, local results in Search drive more than 4 billion connections for businesses every month. This includes more than 2 billion visits to websites as well as connections like phone calls, directions, ordering food and making reservations.We also help the many local businesses that don’t have their own website. Through Google My Business, businesses can create and manage their own page on Google, and get found online. Each month, Google Search connects people with more than 120 million businesses that don’t have a website. People navigate directly to appsSome searches take people directly to apps, rather than to websites. For example, if you search for a TV show, you'll see links to various streaming providers like Netflix or Hulu. If you have that streaming app on your phone, these links will take you directly into the app. The same is true for many other apps, such as Instagram, Amazon, Spotify and more.",
            "More opportunity for websites and businessesWe send billions of visits to websites every day, and the traffic we’ve sent to the open web has increased every year since Google Search was first created. Over the years, we’ve worked to constantly improve Google Search by designing and rolling out helpful features to help people quickly find what they’re looking for, including maps, videos, links to products and services you can buy directly, flight and hotel options, and local business information like hours of operation and delivery services. In doing so, we’ve dramatically grown the opportunity for websites to reach people. In fact, our search results page, which used to show 10 blue links, now shows an average of 26 links to websites on a single search results page on mobile.",
            "Building for the future of the webWe care deeply about the open web and have continually improved Google Search over the years, helping businesses, publishers and creators thrive. Some would argue that we should revert back to showing only 10 blue website links. While we do show website links for many queries today when they are the most helpful response, we also want to build new features that organize information in more helpful ways than just a list of links. And we’ve seen that as we’ve introduced more of these features over the last two decades, the traffic we’re driving to the web has also grown — showing that this is helpful for both consumers and businesses."

            "At Google, our mission has always been to make sure that information serves everyone in important moments, whether it’s helping you find a COVID vaccine near you or get a new job that creates a better life for you and your family.For Rey Justo, the last year has been full of important moments. When the pandemic hit, he lost his job installing fireplaces in Sacramento, Calif., and he and his family had to move in with his grandparents. He had always been interested in technology, so he enrolled in the Google IT Support Certificate through Merit America. After completing the program in three months, he was hired as an apprentice at Zennify, a computer software company.With more businesses embracing digital ways of working, it’s estimated that 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025. As U.S. job growth returns with more people getting vaccinated, we are committed to ensuring that all Americans have the skills they need to benefit from greater economic opportunity. To help, today we’re announcing new efforts, including opening up enrollment for our latest career certificates, expanding our employer consortium, and introducing new tools to improve the job search.",
            "Enroll now: More Google Career CertificatesStarting today, enrollment is open for our latest Google Career Certificates, in the fields of Data Analytics, Project Management, and User Experience (UX) Design. We’re also announcing a new Associate Android Developer Certification, which prepares learners for entry level jobs in Android development. With 1.3 million jobs open in these fields right now in the U.S., the opportunity is significant.We’re also providing 100,000 scholarships to be distributed through nonprofits, workforce development boards, and other community organizations such as Per Scholas, NPower and Goodwill. And we’re working closely with the National Association of Workforce Boards to make sure that local workforce programs, one-stop centers, and community employers know how to refer local job seekers to these certificate programs, as well as connect graduates to local jobs. These certificates have already been successful in bringing in more talent from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech: 53% of graduates of the IT Support Certificate in the U.S. have been female, Black, Latino or veterans. And 82% of graduates overall say the program helped them advance their career within six months, including getting a raise, finding a new job, or starting a new business.",
            "Get hired: Expanding our consortium to 130+ employersMore than 130 employers have joined our employer consortium, eager to hire people who have earned these certificates. Graduates can share their resumes directly with employers like Anthem, Verizon, Bayer, Deloitte, SAP, and Better.com, who are joining Accenture, Walmart, Infosys and, of course, Google. We’re also partnering with Guild Education, which works with Fortune 1000 companies, to bring Google Career Certificates to help some of the country’s largest employers upskill their workforce.Not only is Google hiring these certificate graduates, we’re using the certificates themselves to upskill and reskill Google teams, from IT support techs to data analysts. We’re also opening applications for Google's apprenticeship program in our Career Certificate fields in addition to a few other professional tracks. We will hire hundreds of apprentices over the coming years to participate in on-the-job training and applied learning.Globally, we’re sponsoring 100,000 scholarships for our Career Certificates in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In India, we’re working to make certificates more accessible and launch an employer consortium. And in addition to our Career Certificates, today we’re also making our cloud computing, big data and machine learning trainings free for U.S. job seekers to help prepare for jobs in these high-growth fields.",
            "Improving the Job Search experienceFor many job seekers, it can be difficult to find open roles that match their experience and education. Over the past year, Google Search queries like “great jobs without a degree” spiked 850% in the U.S. Now when you search for “no degree jobs” in the U.S., you’ll see a new job carousel highlighting relevant opportunities near you. You can also filter by education and experience requirements, and there will be new labels on positions that do not mention degrees in their requirements. We’re also working with job sites — including Glassdoor, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Snagajob and CareerBuilder — and U.S. employers to make education and experience requirements clearer on job postings.",
            "A more inclusive economic recoverySince launching Grow with Google in 2017, we’ve helped 6 million Americans get training in digital skills and nearly 170,000 Americans get a new job and increase their income. Now, as economic recovery accelerates in communities around the U.S. and across the globe, we have an opportunity to help build an economy that is more inclusive and equitable. That’s what today’s announcements are designed to do, and we’re excited to partner with employers, community colleges, nonprofits and job seekers to make it happen."

            "The pandemic has taken a devastating toll on communities worldwide. While there is much uncertainty still ahead, the development of multiple safe vaccines in such a short time gives us reason for hope. Now the work begins to ensure that everyone can benefit from this triumph of scientific achievement, and quickly.During the pandemic, Google has helped people get the information they need to keep their families safe and healthy. We’ve supported small businesses and partnered with Apple to build exposure notification technology to fight the spread of COVID-19 around the world. Now, as public health authorities ramp up vaccination efforts, we’re finding more ways to help. We recognize that getting vaccines to people is a complex problem to solve, and we’re committed to doing our part. Today we’re announcing that we’re providing more than $150 million to promote vaccine education and equitable distribution and making it easier to find locally relevant information, including when and where to get the vaccine. We’ll also be opening up Google spaces to serve as vaccination sites as needed.",
            "$150 million to promote vaccine education and equitable access Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve helped more than 100 government agencies and global non-governmental organizations run critical public service health announcements through our Ad Grants Crisis Relief program. Today, we’re announcing an additional $100 million in ad grants for the CDC Foundation, the World Health Organization, and nonprofits around the globe. We’ll invest another $50 million in partnership with public health agencies to reach underserved communities with vaccine-related content and information.Our efforts will focus heavily on equitable access to vaccines. Early data in the U.S. shows that disproportionately affected populations, especially people of color and those in rural communities, aren’t getting access to the vaccine at the same rates as other groups. To help, Google.org has committed $5 million in grants to organizations addressing racial and geographic disparities in COVID-19 vaccinations, including Morehouse School of Medicine’s Satcher Health Leadership Institute and the CDC Foundation.",
            "Highlighting authoritative information and local vaccination sites on Search & MapsTo help find accurate and timely information on vaccines, we’ve expanded our information panels on Search to more than 40 countries and dozens of languages, with more rolling out in the coming week. We’ll begin showing state and regional distribution information on Search so people can easily find when they are eligible to receive a vaccine. Soon we’ll launch a “Get The Facts'' initiative across Google and YouTube to get authoritative information out to the public about vaccines. Searches for “vaccines near me” have increased 5x since the beginning of the year and we want to make sure we’re providing locally relevant answers. In the coming weeks, COVID-19 vaccination locations will be available in Google Search and Maps, starting with Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, with more states and countries to come. We’ll include details like whether an appointment or referral is required, if access is limited to specific groups, or if it has a drive-through. We’re working with partners like VaccineFinder.org, an initiative of Boston Children's Hospital, and other authoritative sources, such as government agencies and retail pharmacies, to gather vaccination location information and make it available.",
            "Opening our spaces for vaccination clinics To help with vaccination efforts, starting in the United States, we’ll make select Google facilities—such as buildings, parking lots and open spaces—available as needed. These sites will be open to anyone eligible for the vaccine based on state and local guidelines. We’ll start by partnering with health care provider One Medical and public health authorities to open sites in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area in California; Kirkland, Washington; and New York City, with plans to expand nationally. We’re working with local officials to determine when sites can open based on local vaccine availability.",
            "Using our technology to improve vaccine distribution Google Cloud is helping healthcare organizations, retail pharmacies, logistics companies, and public sector institutions make use of innovative technologies to speed up delivery of vaccines. For example, logistics companies are using our AI to optimize trucking operations by adapting to traffic or inclement weather, and detect temperature fluctuations during transport. Once vaccines reach their destination, our tools help facilitate pre-screening, scheduling, and follow up. And our Intelligent Vaccine Impact Platform is helping states like New York and North Carolina manage distribution and forecast where vaccines, personal protective equipment, and hospital staffing will be most needed.The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected every community all over the world. It’s also inspired coordination between public and private sectors, and across international borders, on a remarkable scale. We can’t slow down now. Getting vaccines to billions of people won’t be easy, but it’s one of the most important problems we’ll solve in our lifetimes. Google will continue to support in whatever way we can."

        "imp_heading": "Search",
        "Publish Date": "Jan 22, 2021",
        "article_paragraphs": [
            "The beginning of a new year inspires people everywhere to make changes. It's when many of us take stock of our lives, our careers or even just our surroundings and think about what improvements we can make. That's also been the case for Google designer Aileen Cheng. Aileen recently led a major visual redesign of the mobile Search experience, which rolls out in the coming days. “We wanted to take a step back to simplify a bit so people could find what they’re looking for faster and more easily,” she says. “I find it really refreshing. To me, it’s a breath of fresh air!” Like all organizing efforts, this one came with its challenges. “Rethinking the visual design for something like Search is really complex,” Aileen says. “That’s especially true given how much Google Search has evolved. We’re not just organizing the web’s information, but all the world’s information,” Aileen says. “We started with organizing web pages, but now there’s so much diversity in the types of content and information we have to help make sense of.”",
            "We recently had the chance to learn more about the new look from Aileen, as well as the process. Here are five things that drove the redesign: 1. Bringing information into focus. “We want to let the search results shine, allowing people to focus on the information instead of the design elements around it,” says Aileen. “It’s about simplifying the experience and getting people to the information they’re looking for as clearly and quickly as possible.” 2. Making text easier to read. One way the team did this was by using larger, bolder text, so the human eye can scan and understand Search results faster. “We’re making the result and section titles bigger, as well,” Aileen says. While we’re on the subject of text: The update also includes more of Google’s own font, which already shows up in Android and Gmail, among other Google products. “Bringing consistency to when and how we use fonts in Search was important, too, which also helps people parse information more efficiently,” Aileen explains.",
            "3. Creating more breathing room. “We decided to create a new edge-to-edge results design and to minimize the use of shadows, making it easier to immediately see what you’re looking for,” says Aileen. “The overall effect is that you have more visual space and breathing room for Search results and other content to take center stage.”4. Using color to highlight what’s important. Aileen says that some other iterations of the redesign experimented with using lots of bold colors, and others tried more muted tones. They weren’t quite right, though, and ultimately the team focused on centering content and images against a clean background and using color more intentionally to guide the eye to important information without being overwhelming or distracting. “It has an optimistic feel, too,” Aileen says.  5. Leaning into that “Googley” feeling. If you’re noticing the new design feels a little bubblier and bouncier, you’re onto something. “If you look at the Google logo, you’ll notice there’s a lot of roundness to it, so we’re borrowing from that and bringing it to other places as well,” says Aileen. You’ll see that in parts of this redesign, like in rounded icons and imagery. “That form is already so much a part of our DNA. Just look at the Search bar, or the magnifying glass,” Aileen points out.",
            "Part of the work is also in refreshing the look while remaining familiar. “My three-year-old recently dropped a handful of Legos in my hand, red, yellow, green, blue, and he told me, ‘Mama, this is Google,’” Aileen says. “That’s how playful and well known we are to people. And when we redesign something, we want to bring that familiarity and approachability with us, too.”"

            "In a year unlike any other, we knew Google’s 2020 Year in Search campaign would need to take a unique approach. Each year, Google Trends data reflects not only everyday queries, but also the moments, people and ideas that defined that year. Inspired by the year’s Trends data, music producer Peter CottonTale created the song highlighted in Year in Search.Peter is a GRAMMY–winning producer and musician for his work with Chance the Rapper.  He self released his first solo album, CATCH, earlier this year. He’s also collaborated with artists all over the world over the past decade as a composer, producer, and music director, as well as a featured artist primarily on keys. And the Chicago native has a special place in his heart for working with artists from his hometown.",
            "Peter wrote and produced the song “Together” in collaboration with Chance the Rapper, Cynthia Erivo, the Chicago Children’s Choir, Matt Jones (of Re-Collective Orchestra,) and Rachel Robinson and Jamila Woods. “Together” acknowledges 2020’s heartaches and challenges, as well as the need for communities to come together. Ultimately, Peter’s song delivers a message of hope.We sat down with Peter to learn more about his creative process, why this song meant so much to him and the importance of lifting Black voices.",
            "What inspired Together?After hearing about the plans for Year in Search, the context and vision for the project really stood out. From health concerns to the spotlight on the Black struggle, it felt like the right way to help contextualize, increase representation and create opportunities for all of those involved through Google’s Year in Search campaign. My hope is that showcasing opportunities for Black artists with Google will lead to more opportunities and other projects down the road.",
            "Tell us about your creative process. We had initial meetings discussing what 2020 has meant to people. The cast of people involved in creating the music and the film were, if not leaders themselves, surrounded by leaders who in their own way are pushing for change in the community. It was also about giving everyone hope and a bit of celebration too. We wanted to show that by working together, growing together, we will get through this.",
            "How did you select the talent that helped bring your vision to reality?In a year where the focus has been on Black women, I wanted to showcase and highlight amazing Black women artists and writers.  I worked with Jamila Woods and Young Chicago Authors to develop some of the early concepts for the record. Cynthia Erivo, an amazing artist and Black woman,  was the featured female vocalist on the track. And we also included Black artists from a variety of different genres and experiences. To really capture the essence of this year, we asked the Chicago Children’s Choir to join the project. The organization’s social justice history and effort to bring young voices of different backgrounds together through song truly inspired me.",
            "What impact has this year had on you, both personally and professionally? This year has been the craziest year of my life so far for sure, and I’m sure others feel the same way too. I learned how to run and operate my recording studio in the middle of shutdowns, with virtual sessions and other offerings. I had to get really creative about how I rolled out my own music and merchandise. I was in the streets most of the summer alongside community leaders, serving and amplifying the work of friends around me who spent their summer protesting and fighting for Black Lives. And of course, I’ve had to navigate and work around production delays caused by COVID-19, so I’ve found different ways of getting things done, and grown in patience. As tough as this year has been, it has been full of blessings and so many great lessons. I’m really excited for the future.",
            "What is your wish for the future of diversity and representation in creative fields and the music industry?Wow, I have to pick one wish? I always wish for the progression of diversity and the advancement of authentic representation in writers rooms, media and development of culture-based environments.  So often, equity gets lost somewhere, for non-creatives and creatives alike. Black people are a disenfranchised minority who are affected by misrepresentation on a daily basis on macro and micro levels. I couldn’t possibly solve [this] with one wish.As 2020 comes to an end, we are excited to share “Together” with the world. Thank you, Peter and everyone involved the making of this much needed piece of music."

If Google couldn’t consider location in search ranking, our results might display random pizza restaurants that are nowhere near you. With location information, we can better ensure you’re getting webpages and business listings about pizza places that are local and relevant to you.The same is true for many types of businesses and services with physical locations, such as banks, post offices, restaurants or stores. Consider two people who search for zoos—one in Omaha, Nebraska and the other in Mobile, Alabama. Location information helps both get the right local information that they need:",

If you search for “hurricane,” our Crisis Response features can show you local shelter information if there’s a hurricane close by, rather than just generic information about what a hurricane is.Of course, just because some searches have local results, it’s not the case that everyone gets completely different results just because they are in different cities (or even different countries).

            "Twenty years ago, Google published its very first end-of-year list, called the Year-End Google Zeitgeist. Looking back, it’s clear how much some things have changed (please see the list of the top 10 MP3 music resources), and how much they stay the same (decades later and we’re still watching some of these sitcoms). Originally, these year-end lists evolved out of an internal project, eventually becoming the annual, public-facing report in 2001. “It's not a million miles away from what we do now,” says Google Data Trends editor Simon Rogers, looking back on that very first site. The original year-end collection wasn’t just created as a way for people to reflect on Search trends; it was also a way for people, including those who work in marketing or media, to find interesting stories and understand more about the events, people and moments of a certain year. These days, Year in Search is accompanied by a film that showcases the emotion behind the searches and trends of the year. “We also started finding a theme—this year it’s ‘why,’ which was at an all-time high in Google Trends history,” says Simon.  Engineer Roni Rabin has been working on Year in Search for the past eight years and she’s seen it become increasingly sophisticated over time. “It’s always a really special moment once Year in Search launches and we see the world discovering the video and the lists.” And this year, there’s been plenty to discover. Simon calls 2020 a “dramatically interesting year for Search.” Past topics he remembers as significant for Search trends include weather events and the 2016 election—but nothing quite compares to the communal global interests of 2020. “These big, shared moments that affect everybody, they’re pretty rare,” he says. “And just to see so many crammed into such a short period of time, one year, is pretty unusual. I haven’t really seen anything like this.”",
            "While Year in Search has changed over the years, there’s a hopefulness about the project that’s remained. “One of the things that makes me happy every year is how alike we are,” Simon explains. “Despite how different and divided we can be, this year especially, the data really showed how much we have in common.”"

            "Since the outbreak of COVID-19, teams across Google have worked to provide quality information and resources to help keep people safe, and to provide public health, scientists and medical professionals with tools to combat the pandemic. We’ve launched more than 200 new products, features and initiatives—including the Exposure Notification API to assist contact tracing—and have pledged over $1 billion to assist our users, customers and partners around the world. As the world turns its focus to the deployment of vaccines, the type of information people need will evolve. Communities will be vaccinated at an unprecedented pace and scale. This will require sharing information to educate the public, including addressing vaccine misperceptions and hesitance, and helping to surface official guidance to people on when, where and how to get vaccinated. Today, we’re sharing about how we’re working to meet these needs—through our products and partnering with health authorities—while keeping harmful misinformation off our platforms.",
            "Raising authoritative informationBeginning in the United Kingdom, we’re launching a new feature on Search so when people look up information for COVID-19 vaccines, we will surface a list of authorized vaccines in their location, as well as information panels on each individual vaccine. As other health authorities begin authorizing vaccines, we’ll introduce this new feature in more countries.",
            "Launched in March, our COVID-19 information panels on YouTube have been viewed 400 billion times, making them an important source of authoritative information. These panels are featured on the YouTube homepage, and on videos and in search results about the pandemic. Updates to the panels will connect people directly to vaccine information from global and local health authorities. Because YouTube creators are a trusted voice within their communities, we’re also supporting creators by connecting them with leading health experts to make helpful and engaging content for their audiences about COVID-19 and vaccines. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve given $250 million in Ad Grants to help more than 100 government agencies around the world run critical public service announcements about COVID-19. Grantees can use these funds throughout 2021, including for vaccine education and outreach campaigns, and we’re announcing today an additional $15 million in Ad Grants to the World Health Organization (WHO) to assist their global campaign.",
            "Supporting quality reporting and information on vaccinesJournalism continues to play a crucial role in informing people about the pandemic, sharing expert knowledge about vaccines, and proactively debunking misinformation about the immunization process. In April, we gave $6.5 million to support COVID-19 related fact-checking initiatives, which have provided training or resources to nearly 10,000 reporters around the world.Now, the Google News Initiative is providing an additional $1.5 million to fund the creation of a COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub and support new fact-checking research. Led by the Australian Science Media Centre, and with support from technology non-profit Meedan, the hub will be a resource for journalists, providing around-the-clock access to scientific expertise and research updates. The initiative includes science media centers and public health experts from Latin America, Africa, Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, with content being made available in seven languages. To better understand what type of fact-checking can effectively counteract misinformation about vaccines, we’re funding research by academics at Columbia, George Washington and Ohio State universities. This research project will survey citizens in ten countries to find out what kinds of formats, headlines and sources are most effective in correcting COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and whether fact checks that follow these best practices impact willingness to get vaccinated.",
            "Protecting our platforms against misinformation Across our products, we’ve had long-standing policies prohibiting harmful and misleading medical or health-related content. When COVID-19 hit, our global Trust and Safety team worked to stop a variety of abuses stemming from the pandemic: phishing attempts, malware, dangerous conspiracy theories, and fraud schemes. Our teams have also been planning for new threats and abuse patterns related specifically to COVID-19 vaccines. For example, in October, we expanded our COVID-19 medical misinformation policy on YouTube to remove content about vaccines that contradicts consensus from health authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control or the WHO. Our teams have removed more than 700,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 medical information. We also continue to remove harmful COVID-19 misinformation across other products like Ads, Google Maps, and the Play store.The fight against the pandemic and the development of new vaccines has required global collaboration between the public health sector, and the scientific and medical communities. As work begins to vaccinate billions of people, we’ll support these efforts with additional products and features to ensure people have the right information at the right time."

            "It’s been over a month since polls closed in the U.S. 2020 election, and more Americans voted in this election than in any recent Presidential race. In the months—and years—leading up to this cycle, our teams worked hard to create tools that help voters find authoritative information about the election, educate campaigns on how to connect with voters and equip them with best-in-class security features, and protect our platforms from abuse. After Election Day, as votes were still being counted, we continued this work to show timely election results from The Associated Press (AP) on Google. We also enforced a Sensitive Events ads policy after polls closed, temporarily pausing more than 5 million ads referencing the U.S. 2020 election, the candidates, or its outcome as election results were certified. This week, we are lifting this pause and allowing advertisers to continue running election-related ads on our platforms, as long as they comply with our global advertising policies.",
            "Record numbers of voters engaged with Google toolsWe know that people turn to Google to look for information on a variety of topics, and the U.S. 2020 election would be no different. In fact, this U.S. election cycle saw all-time highs in searches for civics-related topics. We worked to create and launch features that would help people find the information they needed to participate in the democratic process. We introduced several features to help voters find information about how to register and how to vote in their states, and as the election neared, we also helped people find polling and ballot drop off locations. Across our products, these features were seen nearly 500 million times. We worked with non-partisan, third-party data partners, such as Democracy Works, which aggregates official data directly from state and county election administrators, and we linked to state government official websites for more information. Using this data, we also made it easy for people to quickly find nearby voting locations in Google Maps, along with information about how far they were, how to get there, and voting hours. From mid-October through Election Day, we added more than 125,000 voting locations in Google Maps. We also showed “how to register” and “how to vote” reminders to all our U.S. users directly on Google Search, Maps and YouTube, to help everyone across the country find the information they needed to register to vote, find their voting locations, and cast their ballots. These reminders were seen over 2 billion times across our products. And starting on Election Day, we worked with the AP to provide real-time election results for relevant searches on Google. This results feature had more than six times the number of views in 2020 as in 2016. Additionally, YouTube linked to this results feature in its election results information panel, which was shown over 4.5 billion times.",
            "How we helped educate and protect campaignsWe also focused on helping campaigns and elected officials effectively use Google and YouTube products to reach voters and on helping them enhance their election security. As part of our Civics Outreach Virtual Training Series, Google held 21 training sessions for over 900 candidates, campaigns, public officials, and nonprofit leaders. Overall, we held 45 group and individual trainings to help more than 2,900 election workers learn to use Google tools to amplify their message and better connect with voters through events like digital town halls, debates and virtual campaign rallies.And as a part of our Election Cybersecurity Initiative with the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School, nearly 4,000 elected officials, secretaries of state, campaign staffers, political party representatives, and state election directors in all 50 states received training on ways to secure their information and protect their campaigns against cyberattacks. At the start of the 2020 election season, we partnered with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to give any federal campaign access to free security keys—the strongest form of two-factor authentication. We helped DDC distribute more than 10,500 Advanced Protection kits. Now, we continue to educate campaigns and newly elected officials about digital security and encourage them to enroll in our Advanced Protection Program.",
            "Protecting our platforms from abuseIn the years leading up to the 2020 election, we made numerous enhancements to protect the integrity of elections around the world and better secure our platforms: we introduced strict policies and restrictions around who can run election-related advertising on our platform; we launched comprehensive political ad libraries in the U.S., the UK, the European Union, India, Israel and New Zealand; we developed and implemented policies to prohibit election-related abuse such as voter suppression and deceptive practices on platforms like YouTube, Google Ads, Google Maps and Google Play; our Threat Analysis Group (TAG) launched a quarterly bulletin to provide regular updates on our work to combat coordinated influence operations across our platforms and flagged phishing attempts against the presidential campaigns this summer; and we worked closely with government agencies, including the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, and others companies to share information around suspected election interference campaigns. And long before any voting in this election started, our global Trust and Safety teams were already working through possible threat scenarios and abuse vectors related to the election. These teams work in a variety of roles to help develop and enforce our policies in an apolitical and non-partisan way, monitor our platforms for abuse, and protect users from everything from account hijackings and disinformation campaigns to misleading content and inauthentic activity. We estimate that we spent at least $1 billion over the past year on content moderation systems and processes. We continue to invest aggressively in this area.The job of protecting our platforms from abuse is always a top priority, but especially during sensitive times like elections. Our election integrity work may not directly drive Google’s business, but it’s a crucial part of our responsibility to our users and to the democratic process. That’s why our teams are already looking at what's coming up next—including 2021 elections in the U.S., the Netherlands, Japan, Israel, Ecuador and many other countries."

        "Publish Date": "Dec 04, 2020",
        "article_paragraphs": [
            "In 2015, the mobile web was not in a good place. An analysis of more than 10,000 mobile web domains showed that the average load time for mobile sites was 19 seconds over 3G connections. As a result, new proprietary mobile web formats arose as companies that distributed content looked for new ways to keep their products compelling and asked publishers to use them. Publishers, who were already strapped for resources, told us they’d be unable to keep up with a pattern of each company inventing their own new format. After discussions with European publishers, we partnered with the industry to build a new format—one that was based on the web and that would work for a wide variety of platforms. It would preserve the publisher’s freedom to choose their own tools (such as content management systems, analytics, video players and advertising platforms), keep their own unique page designs, host the content on their own servers and monetize the way they wanted either with paywalls, ads or both. It would be open-source and extensible so that new capabilities could be introduced by anyone, platform and publisher alike. And that’s how the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project, or AMP, was created. We strongly believe AMP has played a positive role in reversing the trends that made it so difficult for publishers to achieve great user experiences at the time. The AMP Project’s evolution over the last five years, from enhancing product capabilities to joining the OpenJS Foundation, has helped us continue to collaborate with the news industry and deliver meaningful value to publishers. But there are several misconceptions about AMP, and we want to set the record straight.",
            "AMP pages are open and exist well beyond Google.First, we want to clarify exactly how AMP works. AMP pages are not locked into Google products and behave just like any other page on the open web. They can be visited directly, linked to and crawled, and are used by a wide variety of search engines. (Bing, Google and Yahoo Japan! all link to AMP pages.) Social platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest also use the format to direct their users to a reliably fast and smooth loading experience.Additionally, AMP pages do not divert traffic away from other websites to benefit Google. When it comes to news, we drive more than 24 billion clicks a month to news sites. And each visit is an opportunity for a publisher to show ads or convert a casual reader into a loyal subscriber.",
            "Publishers have control over the aspects of their AMP pages.With AMP, the publisher controls almost every aspect, from content presentation to the underlying monetization strategy of their page. Publishers also decide how they want to show up on Google; they decide the length of the short summary (called a snippet) of their content and can add or remove images or videos. There are no license fees for AMP and all traffic data goes directly to the publisher. Publishers can collect the same data as with any other web page by using most of the standard tools available, and today 80 analytics providers support AMP.Although Google collects and uses additional data in order to be able to present AMP documents, we do so only for the purposes of operating the Google AMP Cache and AMP Viewer. The data from the Google AMP Cache allows us to record documents requested from it and validate that the cache is functioning normally. Data from the AMP Viewer allows us to optimize the viewing experience of pages displayed. xAMP gives publishers the same ability to build direct relationships with readers as any web page. In collaboration with publishers and 3P paywall providers, project contributors designed a solution to allow publishers to integrate AMP into their existing subscriptions strategies without compromising on page speed or user experience. Contributors are also constantly adding functionality to bring interactive features to AMP articles that allow publishers to further engage with their audience.  AMP supports 240 different ad networks and provides publishers with flexibility to choose how they want to monetize. As AMP was intentionally designed to ensure users have high-quality experiences, there are some user-focused rules that guide how content and advertising work on the page. For example, this includes what kind of ads can appear and how they show up to avoid slow load times. AMP also does not support popup ads because they are intrusive and create a negative user experience.",
            "AMP is not a ranking factor for Google Search results.When it comes to ranking in Google Search results, AMP pages are treated just like any other HTML page on the web. AMP has never been a ranking factor in organic search results on Google.  At the moment, only pages built using AMP can be included in the Top Stories Carousel feature in Google Search to ensure users could easily find fast-loading pages and swipe from story to story.  But this is changing. We recently announced a change, opening up this feature to any content that meets the Google News content policies starting in May 2021. We will prioritize pages with great page experience, whether implemented using AMP or any other web technology, as we rank the results.",
            "AMP is an open project led by many.AMP is an open-source initiative started five years ago at Google along with other tech companies and members of the web community. More than 1,000 developers around the world, many from companies like Twitter, Pinterest, Yahoo and Bing, contribute time and resources to improve AMP. In 2018 AMP launched a new governance model, transitioning the project's ownership to the OpenJS Foundation a year later. These changes have helped open development of AMP to more publishers via AMP’s Advisory Committee and Technical Steering Committee. Today anyone can join an AMP working group to help shape the future of the project.",
            "Google supports a vibrant and healthy open web.From our funding of open-source projects that are vital to the sustainability of the web, to our most recent efforts around Core Web Vitals, which provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience, we are committed to supporting a vibrant and healthy open web. We build technology that provides helpful experiences for users, delivers value to publishers and creators and helps the wider web. AMP is a key part of our commitment to these values and is a product we’re constantly working to improve with the wider online community."

            "If you’re searching for information on Google where businesses might have relevant services or products to provide, you will likely come across ads. These could be ads from the flower shop down the street, your favorite nonprofit or a large retailer. If there are no useful ads to show for your search, you won’t see any--which is actually the case for a large majority of searches. Our goal is to provide you with relevant information to help you find exactly what you’re looking for. And we only make money if ads are useful and relevant, as indicated by your click on the ad.",
            "How and when we show ads in SearchNearly all of the ads you see are on searches with commercial intent, such as searches for “sneakers,” “t-shirt” or “plumber.” We’ve long said that we don’t show ads--or make money--on the vast majority of searches.  In fact, on average over the past four years, 80 percent of searches on Google haven’t had any ads at the top of search results. Further, only a small fraction of searches--less than 5 percent--currently have four top text ads. Though we follow established principles for how and when ads can appear in Google Search, there are a variety of factors beyond our control that influence how many top ads people may see, like whether you're searching for something commercial, whether advertisers are interested in advertising against that subject, or whether there are ads that are relevant to your query. For example, in April 2020, people saw an average of 40 percent fewer top text ads per search than they did compared to April 2019. This was primarily due to COVID-related effects, when advertisers were reducing their ad budgets and users were searching less for commercial interests. Therefore, Google Search users saw fewer ads on average.",
            "It’s about quality, not quantityOrganizations that want to advertise in Google Search participate in an auction and set their own bids (the amount they are willing to pay per click) and budgets. But advertisers’ bids are only one component of our ad ranking algorithms. When it comes to the ads you see, the relevance of those ads to your search and the overall quality of the advertisers’ ads and websites are key components of our algorithms as well. That means that no matter how large or small the organization is, they have an opportunity to reach potential customers with their message in Google Search. In the Google Ads auction, advertisers are often charged less, and sometimes much less, than their bid.The experience of our users comes first, which is why we only show ads that are helpful to people. Even for the fraction of search queries where we do show ads, we don't make a cent unless people find it relevant enough to click on the ad. We invest significantly in our ads quality systems to continuously improve on our ability to show ads that are highly relevant to people, and helpful to what they’re searching for. Over time, this has led to better, more relevant ads and major improvements in the overall user experience. In fact, over the last four years, we’ve been able to reduce the rate of low quality and irrelevant ads by 3x. Part of delivering a great user experience is also ensuring that Google Search ads are clearly labeled as coming from an advertiser―and we’ve long been an industry leader in providing prominent ad labeling. When Search ads do appear, they have the word “Ad” clearly labeled in bold black text in the current design. We rely on extensive user testing both on mobile and desktop to ensure ad labels meet our high standards for being prominent and distinguishable from unpaid results.",
            "A level playing field for all businesses, regardless of budget or sizeWith ads on Google Search we give businesses, organizations and governments around the world an opportunity to reach millions of people with information. Every advertiser, regardless of their budget, has the opportunity to reach people with ads in Google Search. That’s why, for small and local businesses in particular, Google Search ads help them compete with the largest companies for the same customers and opportunities, not just in their communities but also around the world. Every day, countless small businesses use Google Search ads to help drive awareness for their products and services and reach new customers. Just this year, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Google Search ads helped a bakery in New York reach more local customers and expand their business, provided a bicycle shop in South Dakota with the tools to go global, and gave a Black-owned chocolate shop in Dallas the opportunity to find new chocolate lovers from as far away as India. We also help connect people to causes through our Ad Grants program which gives nonprofits $10,000 a month in Search ads to help them attract donors, recruit volunteers and promote their missions. Earlier this year as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, we increased our grants to help government agencies take swift action and get lifesaving information to the public and local communities.

            "When you come to Google and do a search, there might be billions of pages that are potential matches for your query, and millions of new pages being produced every minute. In the early days, we updated our search index once per month. Now, like other search engines, Google is constantly indexing new info to make accessible through Search.But to make all of this information useful, it’s critical that we organize it in a way that helps people quickly find what they’re looking for. With this in mind, here’s a closer look at how we approach organizing information on Google Search.",
            "Organizing information in rich and helpful featuresGoogle indexes all types of information—from text and images in web pages, to real-world information, like whether a local store has a sweater you’re looking for in stock. To make this information useful to you, we organize it on the search results page in a way that makes it easy to scan and digest. When looking for jobs, you often want to see a list of specific roles. Whereas if you’re looking for a restaurant, seeing a map can help you easily find a spot nearby. We offer a wide range of features—from video and news carousels, to results with rich imagery, to helpful labels like star reviews—to help you navigate the available information more seamlessly. These features include links to web pages, so you can easily click to a website to find more information. In fact, we’ve grown the average number of outbound links to websites on a search results page from only 10 (“10 blue links”) to now an average of 26 links on a mobile results page. As we’ve added more rich features to Google Search, people are more likely to find what they’re looking for, and websites have more opportunity to appear on the first page of search results.",
            "Presenting information in rich features, like an image carousel or a map, makes Google Search more helpful, both to people and to businesses. These features are designed so you can find the most relevant and useful information for your query. By improving our ability to deliver relevant results, we’ve seen that people are spending more time on the webpages they find through Search. The amount of time spent on websites following a click from Google Search has significantly grown year over year.",
            "Helping you explore and navigate topicsAnother important element of organizing information is helping you learn more about a topic. After all, most queries don’t just have a single answer—they’re often open-ended questions like “dessert ideas.”Our user experience teams spend a lot of time focused on how we can make it easy and intuitive to refine your search as you go. This is why we’ve introduced features like carousels, where you can easily swipe your phone screen to get more results. For instance, if you search for “meringue,” you might see a list of related topics along with related questions that other people have asked to help you on your journey.",
            "How features and results are rankedOrganizing information into easy-to-use formats is just one piece of the puzzle. To make all of this information truly useful, we also must order, or “rank,” results in a way that ensures the most helpful and reliable information rises to the top.Our ranking systems consider a number of factors—from what words appear on the page, to how fresh the content is—to determine what results are most relevant and helpful for a given query. Underpinning these systems is a deep understanding of information—from language and visual content to context like time and place—that allows us to match the intent of your query with the most relevant, highest quality results available. In cases where there’s a single answer, like “When was the first Academy Awards?,” directly providing that answer is the most helpful result, so it will appear at the top of the page. But sometimes queries can have many interpretations. Take a query like “pizza”—you might be looking for restaurants nearby, delivery options, pizza recipes, and more. Our systems aim to compose a page that is likely to have what you’re looking for, ranking results for the most likely intents at the top of the page. Ranking a pizza recipe first would certainly be relevant, but our systems have learned that people searching for “pizza” are more likely to be looking for restaurants, so we’re likely to show a map with local restaurants first. Contrast that to a query like “pancake” where we find that people are more likely looking for recipes, so recipes often rank higher, and a map with restaurants serving pancakes may appear lower on the page.",
            "An important thing to remember is that ranking is dynamic. New things are always happening in the world, so the available information and the meaning of queries can change day-by-day. This summer, searches for “why is the sky orange” turned from a general question about sunsets to a specific, locally relevant query about weather conditions on the West Coast of the U.S. due to wildfires. We constantly evaluate the quality of our results to ensure that even as queries or content changes, we’re still providing helpful information. More than 10,000 search quality raters around the world help us conduct hundreds of thousands of tests every year, and it’s through this process that we know that our investments in Google Search truly benefit people.We’ve heard people ask if we design our search ranking systems to benefit advertisers, and we want to be clear: that is absolutely not the case. We never provide special treatment to advertisers in how our search algorithms rank their websites, and nobody can pay us to do so. To learn more about ads and how they appear in Search, check out the next blog post in our How Search Works series.",
            "Ongoing investment in a high quality experienceAs we’ve seen for many years, and as was particularly apparent in the wake of COVID-19, information needs can change rapidly. As the world changes, we are always looking for new ways we can make Google Search better and help people improve their lives through access to information.Every year, we make thousands of improvements to Google Search, all of which we test to ensure they’re truly making the experience more intuitive, modern, delightful, helpful and all-around better for the billions of queries we get every day. Search will never be a solved problem, but we’re committed to continuing to innovate to make Google better for you."

            "Since Google was founded more than 22 years ago, we’ve continued to pursue an ambitious mission of organizing the world’s information and making it universally accessible and useful. While we started with organizing web pages, our mission has always been much more expansive. We didn’t set out to organize the web’s information, but all the world’s information. Quickly, Google expanded beyond the web and began to look for new ways to understand the world and make information and knowledge accessible for more people. The internet—and the world—have changed a lot since those early days, and we’ve continued to improve Google Search to both anticipate and respond to the ever-evolving information needs that people have. It’s no mystery that the search results you saw back in 1998 look different than what you might find today. So we wanted to share an overview of where the information on Google comes from and, in another post, how we approach organizing an ever-expanding universe of web pages, images, videos, real-world insights and all the other forms of information out there.Information from the open webYou’re probably familiar with web listings on Google—the iconic “blue link” results that take you to pages from across the web. These listings, along with many other features on the search results page, link out to pages on the open web that we’ve crawled and indexed, following instructions provided by the site creators themselves.Site owners have the control to tell our web crawler (Googlebot) what pages we should crawl and index, and they even have more granular controls to indicate which portions of a page should appear as a text snippet on Google Search. Using our developer tools, site creators can choose if they want to be discovered via Google and optimize their sites to improve how they’re presented, with the aim to get more free traffic from people looking for the information and services they’re offering. Google Search is one of many ways people find information and websites.  Every day, we send billions of visitors to sites across the web, and the traffic we send has grown every year since Google started. This traffic goes to a wide range of websites, helping people discover new companies, blogs, and products, not just the largest, well known sites on the web. Every day, we send visitors to well over 100 million different websites. Common knowledge and public data sourcesCreators, publishers and businesses of all sizes work to create unique content, products and services. But there is also information that falls into the category of what you might describe as common knowledge—information that wasn’t uniquely created or doesn’t “belong” to any one person, but represents a set of facts that is broadly known. Think: the birthdate of a historical figure, the height of the tallest mountain in South America, or even what day it is today. We help people easily find these types of facts through a variety of Google Search features like knowledge panels. The information comes from a wide range of openly licensed sources such as Wikipedia, The Encyclopedia of Life, Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Data, and the Data Commons Project, an open knowledge database of statistical data we started in collaboration with the U.S. Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Eurostat, World Bank and many others.Another type of common knowledge is the product of calculations, and this is information that Google often generates directly. So when you search for a conversion of time (“What time is it in London?”) or measurement (“How many pounds in a metric ton?”), or want to know the square root of 348, those are pieces of information that Google calculates. Fun fact: we also calculate the sunrise and sunset times for locations based on latitude and longitude!Licenses and partnershipsWhen it comes to organizing information, unstructured data (words and phrases on web pages) is more challenging for our automated systems to understand. Structured databases, including public knowledge bases like Wikidata, make it a lot easier for our systems to understand, organize and present facts in helpful features and formats.For some specialized types of data, like sports scores, information about TV shows and movies, and song lyrics, there are providers who work to organize information in a structured format and offer technical solutions (like APIs) to deliver fresh info. We license data from these companies to ensure that providers and creators (like music publishers and artists) are compensated for their work. When people come to Google looking for this information, they can access it right away.We always work to deliver high quality information, and for topics like health or civic participation that affect people’s livelihoods, easy access to reliable, authoritative information is critically important. For these types of topics, we work with organizations like local health authorities, such as the CDC in the U.S., and nonpartisan, nonprofit organizations like Democracy Works to make authoritative information readily available on Google.Information that people and businesses provideThere’s a wide range of information that exists in the world that isn’t currently available on the open web, so we look for ways to help people and businesses share these updates, including by providing information directly to Google. Local businesses can claim their Business Profile and share the latest with potential customers on Search, even if they don’t have a website. In fact, each month Google Search connects people with more than 120 million businesses that don’t have a website. On average, local results in Search drive more than 4 billion connections for businesses every month, including more than 2 billion visits to websites as well as connections like phone calls, directions, ordering food and making reservations.We’re also deeply investing in new techniques to ensure that we’re reflecting the latest accurate information. This can be especially challenging as local information is constantly changing and not often accurately reflected on the web. For example, in the wake of COVID-19, we’ve used our Duplex conversational technology to call businesses, helping to update their listings by confirming details like modified store hours or whether they offer takeout and delivery. Since this work began, we’ve made over 3 million updates to businesses like pharmacies, restaurants and grocery stores that have been seen over 20 billion times in Maps and Search. Other businesses like airlines, retailers and manufacturers also provide Google and other sites with data about their products and inventory through direct feeds. So when you search for a flight from Bogota to Lima, or want to learn more about the specs of the hottest new headphones, Google can provide high quality information straight from the source.We also provide ways for people to share their knowledge about places across more than 220 countries and territories. Thanks to millions of contributions submitted by users every day—from reviews and ratings to photos, answers to questions, address updates and more—people all around the world can find the latest, accurate local information on Google Search and Maps. Newly created information and insights from GoogleThrough advancements in AI and machine learning, we’ve developed innovative ways to derive new insights from the world around us, providing people with information that can not only help them in their everyday lives, but also keep them safe.For years, people have turned to our Popular Times feature to help gauge the crowds at their favorite brunch spots or visit their local grocery store when it’s less busy. We're continually improving the accuracy and coverage of this feature, currently available for 20 million places around the world on Maps and Search. Now, this technology is serving more critical needs during COVID. With an expansion of our live busyness feature, these Google insights are helping people take crowdedness into account as they patronize businesses through the pandemic. We also generate new insights to aid in crisis response—from wildfire maps based on satellite data to AI-generated flood forecasting—to help people stay out of harm’s way when disaster strikes.Organizing information and making it accessible and usefulSimply compiling a wide range of information is not enough. Core to making information accessible is organizing it in a way that people can actually use it. How we organize information continues to evolve, especially as new information and content formats become available.

            "When patients prepare for a medical visit, they're more likely to have a high quality, efficient encounter and better physical and mental health outcomes. Starting today, we’re piloting a new tool that helps people prepare for visits by surfacing common questions they may have about their care--available when people find a local doctor’s office or hospital on Search. Built in collaboration with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, our tool helps people build a visit plan by selecting from evidence-based questions like, “What is this test for?” as well as adding their own questions. When they’re finished, they can print or email the visit plan and bring it to the doctor’s office to help them remember important questions they want to ask. The visit plan also includes a reminder of things patients should bring to the visit, like a list of current medications, recent lab results, and their insurance card. The tool is private and secure: Google does not store any of the information.",
            "Ten questions for more engaged careThe suggested questions, developed by AHRQ as part of its “Questions are the Answer” initiative, are designed to get people thinking about their goals and priorities for the visit. They’re based on findings from dozens of patient safety research projects as well as AHRQ’s expertise on diagnostic testing and results, medication safety, safe transitions between care settings, and the importance of patient and family engagement in healthcare.“Patients who prepare for medical visits by prioritizing their questions, strengthen their role as members of their own health care team,” said Jeffrey Brady, M.D., M.P.H., a preventive medicine physician and Director of the Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety at the AHRQ. Dr. Brady added, “This helps clinicians maximize their time with patients so they can better address their most critical health needs. Clinicians appreciate that healthcare can be more efficient, effective, and higher quality when they work together with patients.”",
            "Protecting health information People come to Google for health-related information every day, and we’re committed to helping them get the information they need along their healthcare journey. The tool does not gather any personal health information or store any of the information that is entered into the tool. People have the option to print or email their visit plan, and people can use this tool without signing into a Google account. This tool is in a pilot phase and is currently available to a limited number of people in the United States and will expand to more users over time. Healthcare can be confusing and overwhelming, but simply thinking about goals before meeting with a clinician can have a huge impact on patient experience and health outcomes. With the visit planning tool, we hope more people will effectively plan for medical visits, get more out of their visits and ultimately achieve better health outcomes."

Try recording a special moment with them and adding it to “The Great Thanksgiving Listen,” a StoryCorps campaign that encourages people across the country to contribute audio stories to a collective oral history. Google Cloud also recently partnered with StoryCorps to make its entire catalog of stories available and searchable for everyone, with help from AI.As a fun bonus, search “Happy Thanksgiving” on Google for a hidden surprise. We figured it wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without a slice of something sweet."

And even though many of us have had to change or cancel our travel plans, it’s still a great time to seek inspiration for our next great adventure. That's why, with Google Arts & Culture, we’re launching a new virtual tour feature on Google Search for over 100 global museums and cultural sites. You can drop in and explore the Palace of Versailles, the former residence of French kings, or visit the Palace Museum, which Chinese emperors called home for almost 500 years. If you search in English for information about these sites, you’ll see a link to the virtual tour in the \"About\" section. The tour brings together photos, 360-degree Street View imagery, and artifacts to give you a taste of what it’s like to visit in person.",

            "Contributing to economic recovery effortsAs I’ve written earlier, to help small businesses gain easier access to badly-needed capital, we founded the $170 million Grow with Google Small Business Fund alongside $10 million in Google.org grants, with an aim to help the most underserved small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities. In collaboration with Opportunity Finance Network, more than $53 million dollars of loans and Google.org grants have been allocated to community partners who are focused on serving rural, women, Black, Latino and Native borrowers, which helps American communities start to get back on their feet. Tires by Papi and Bailiwick Clothing Company are two such examples.Of course, our greatest contribution continues to be developing products to help people stay informed, adapt and get through this pandemic. According to the Connected Commerce Council, nearly one in three small business owners report that without digital tools they would close all or parts of their business. To help small businesses, we rolled out many new, free product features earlier this year, so that they can inform their customers about things like takeout, delivery, no-contact delivery, or curbside pickup. Today, people can now find this information on Search and Maps for more than 2 million restaurants and retailers in the U.S.",
            "We’ve used Google’s Duplex technology to make calls to businesses and confirm things like temporary closures. This has enabled us to make 3 million updates to business information globally, which have been seen by people over 20 billion times in Search and Maps. To help people searching for jobs, we have stepped up to help in many ways. We added new relevant features in the U.S. like showing jobs that can be done remotely. Google Cloud has partnered with different states to help jobseekers: we assisted Rhode Island’s Virtual Career Center, a new platform that  connects thousands of jobseekers with jobs and employment services; worked with the State of Illinois to develop a 24/7 Virtual Intelligent Agent on the IDES website; developed a chatbot, in partnership with the New Jersey Office of Innovation to provide real-time answers to the 20 most popular unemployment questions. These are just some of the examples. We also transformed our free Grow with Google training to virtual formats and have already trained more than 1 million Americans on digital skills this year. The Google IT Support Professional Certificate—which takes beginner learners to entry-level jobs ready in under six months—has become the most popular certificate on Coursera during COVID-19.",
            "Providing trusted informationQuestions related to the pandemic are more searched than sports or music (and even elections) in every state. Top coronavirus related searches in the U.S. this month:Coronavirus symptomsCoronavirus updateCoronavirus vaccineAcross the U.S. people are searching on Google to stay informed and adapt. In 47 states, the top coronavirus-related question during the last six months has been “How many cases of coronavirus in [my state].” Search interest for “online courses” reached an all-time high in April this year, as did searches for “unemployment,”compared to search trends over the last 15 years. During this time, we’ve also seen people seek out information to help them navigate their daily lives. For example, since the pandemic began, searches for “curbside pickup” have increased 13-fold compared to this time last year, while searches for “contact tracing” spiked 1,000 percent  in April and then reached an all-time high in May. In March, we launched Search Knowledge Panels so when people search for information related to COVID-19, they immediately see local guidance, information about symptoms, prevention and treatments. We’ve committed $250 million in Ad Grants to help government agencies provide critical information related to COVID-19. As of today we’ve served more than 100 million PSAs from local public health agencies, which have been seen by tens of millions of people across the U.S.We also launched the Journalism Emergency Relief Fund to provide emergency funding for small and medium sized news organizations covering the pandemic. To date, we’ve distributed $9 million to U.S. newsrooms across all 50 states.",
            "Helping people make safe choices To help people make informed decisions about where to go, the COVID layer in Google Maps shows critical information about new cases in an area and how they’re trending. As of this month, our COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which are used by public health agencies and researchers around the globe, have been downloaded more than 16 million times. In May, we partnered with Apple to launch the Exposure Notifications System (ENS) and made it available to public health authorities around the world in their fight against COVID-19. Designed specifically and carefully to protect users’ privacy while helping public health authorities and governments manage countries’ re-opening, today 13 states and U.S. territories have built apps based on this ENS technology.In a short time, COVID-19 has changed how people live their lives. We’ll continue to update our products and roll out initiatives to help people and American businesses find trusted information, adapt and manage economic uncertainty."

            "With more people staying at home, video streaming is up everywhere—and by as much as 60 percent in Southeast Asia, according to a Media Partners Asia study. That makes it all the more critical that we and our partners in the region continue to address the serious challenge of online piracy.   Google’s overall approach is set out in our Anti-Piracy Principles, and we work closely with media and entertainment industry organizations to tackle new challenges. Two years ago, we started talking to the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA), the trade group for the video ecosystem in Asia, about how we could collaborate. Since then, we’ve been having quarterly forums with their members: broadcasters, operators and telcos. We also make sure AVIA members are aware of new features like What to Watch, to ensure their legitimate content is visible and prominent on the Search results page.To learn more about online piracy in Asia Pacific (APAC), we spoke to Louis Boswell, CEO of AVIA. How does the APAC region differ from others when it comes to broadcast, media and  entertainment?There are very divergent tastes in content across APAC, which is not surprising given the different cultures and languages. The genres that work best across multiple markets would be a mix of Western, Korean and Chinese content. These genres are widely available, but fragmented over many services, some not mature, and business models vary. In parts of the region, people have never developed a habit of paying for content, so platforms often feel they have to adapt their business models to compete with piracy in a far more pronounced way than in the West. In terms of consumption, many markets are mobile-first.What role should education play in efforts to fight piracy? Do consumers in the region know how to access legitimate alternatives and why they should choose these options?Consumer awareness is important to any anti-piracy strategy. Consumers need to know the very real risks they face from malware when accessing piracy sites or using illicit applications. Most people know that what they are accessing is stolen content: in a recent YouGov survey, commissioned by AVIA’s Coalition Against Piracy (CAP), when asked who was most responsible for preventing piracy, Singaporeans chose “the individual, for choosing not to watch pirated content.” There are many legal and reliable video streaming services available in Southeast Asia. Websites that are dedicated to infringement are unreliable, put people at risk of malware infection, and fund crime groups. Over the last few years, Google has been a partner of AVIA—working to fight piracy in the region. Why are these types of partnerships worthwhile?Piracy is an industry-wide problem, and industry needs to come together to fight it. AVIA represents many of the biggest IP owners in the region and Google has the most popular search engine and online video platform, so a couple of years ago we both agreed that it made sense for us to sit down and have a frank and open conversation about the problems of piracy, understand the tools and measures Google is putting in place, and provide a forum for our members to raise concerns that Google may be able to address.It has been a constructive and collaborative process which has been appreciated on both sides. And it has led to new initiatives, including a workshop AVIA arranged for many of its Asia-based IP creators across India, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia—designed to make better use of Google’s tools for removing infringing content. It’s a positive step that content producers, distributors and industry associations are now working together to address the problems, as well as partnering with technology platforms, payment processors, e-market platforms and other intermediaries."

            "When I first came across the web as a computer scientist in the mid-90s, I was struck by the sheer volume of information online, in contrast with how hard it was to find what you were looking for. It was then that I first started thinking about search, and I’ve been fascinated by the problem ever since. We’ve made tremendous progress over the past 22 years, making Google Search work better for you every day. With recent advancements in AI, we’re making bigger leaps forward in improvements to Google than we’ve seen over the last decade, so it’s even easier for you to find just what you’re looking for. Today during our Search On livestream, we shared how we're bringing the most advanced AI into our products to further our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.",
            "Helping you find exactly what you’re looking forAt the heart of Google Search is our ability to understand your query and rank relevant results for that query. We’ve invested deeply in language understanding research, and last year we introduced how BERT language understanding systems are helping to deliver more relevant results in Google Search. Today we’re excited to share that BERT is now used in almost every query in English, helping you get higher quality results for your questions. We’re also sharing several new advancements to search ranking, made possible through our latest research in AI: SpellingWe’ve continued to improve our ability to understand misspelled words, and for good reason—one in 10 queries every day are misspelled. Today, we’re introducing a new spelling algorithm that uses a deep neural net to significantly improve our ability to decipher misspellings. In fact, this single change makes a greater improvement to spelling than all of our improvements over the last five years.",
            "PassagesVery specific searches can be the hardest to get right, since sometimes the single sentence that answers your question might be buried deep in a web page. We’ve recently made a breakthrough in ranking and are now able to better understand the relevancy of specific passages. By understanding passages in addition to the relevancy of the overall page, we can find that needle-in-a-haystack information you’re looking for. This technology will improve 7 percent of search queries across all languages as we roll it out globally.",
            "SubtopicsWe’ve applied neural nets to understand subtopics around an interest, which helps deliver a greater diversity of content when you search for something broad. As an example, if you search for “home exercise equipment,” we can now understand relevant subtopics, such as budget equipment, premium picks, or small space ideas, and show a wider range of content for you on the search results page. We’ll start rolling this out by the end of this year.",
            "Access to high quality information during COVID-19We’re making several new improvements to help you navigate your world and get things done more safely and efficiently. Live busyness updates show you how busy a place is right now so you can more easily social distance, and we’ve added a new feature to Live View to help you get essential information about a business before you even step inside. We’re also adding COVID-19 safety information front and center on Business Profiles across Google Search and Maps. This will help you know if a business requires you to wear a mask, if you need to make an advance reservation, or if the staff is taking extra safety precautions, like temperature checks. And we’ve used our Duplex conversational technology to help local businesses keep their information up-to-date online, such as opening hours and store inventory.Understanding key moments in videosUsing a new AI-driven approach, we’re now able to understand the deep semantics of a video and automatically identify key moments. This lets us tag those moments in the video, so you can navigate them like chapters in a book. Whether you’re looking for that one step in a recipe tutorial, or the game-winning home run in a highlights reel, you can easily find those moments. We’ve started testing this technology this year, and by the end of 2020 we expect that 10 percent of searches on Google will use this new technology.",
            "Deepening understanding through dataSometimes the best search result is a statistic. But often stats are buried in large datasets and not easily comprehensible or accessible online. Since 2018, we’ve been working on the Data Commons Project, an open knowledge database of statistical data started in collaboration with the U.S. Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, World Bank and many others. Bringing these datasets together was a first step, and now we’re making this information more accessible and useful through Google Search.Now when you ask a question like “how many people work in Chicago ,” we use natural language processing to map your search to one specific set of the billions of data points in Data Commons to provide the right stat in a visual, easy to understand format. You’ll also find other relevant data points and context—like stats for other cities—to help you easily explore the topic in more depth.",
            "Helping quality journalism through advanced searchQuality journalism often comes from long-term investigative projects, requiring time consuming work sifting through giant collections of documents, images and audio recordings. As part of Journalist Studio, our new suite of tools to help reporters do their work more efficiently, securely, and creatively through technology, we’re launching Pinpoint, a new tool that brings the power of Google Search to journalists. Pinpoint helps reporters quickly sift through hundreds of thousands of documents by automatically identifying and organizing the most frequently mentioned people, organizations and locations. Reporters can sign up to request access to Pinpoint starting this week.Search what you see, and explore information in 3DFor many topics, seeing is key to understanding. Several new features in Lens and AR in Google Search help you learn, shop, and discover the world in new ways. Many of us are dealing with the challenges of learning from home, and with Lens, you can now get step-by-step homework help on math, chemistry, biology and physics problems. Social distancing has also dramatically changed how we shop, so we’re making it easier to visually shop for what you’re looking for online, whether you’re looking for a sweater or want a closer look at a new car but can’t visit a showroom. If you don’t know how to search it, sing itWe’ve all had that experience of having a tune stuck in our head, but can’t quite remember the lyrics. Now, when those moments arise, you just have to hum to search, and our AI models can match the melody to the right song. What sets Google Search apartThere has never been more choice in the ways people access information, and we need to constantly develop cutting-edge technology to ensure that Google remains the most useful and most trusted way to search. Four key elements form the foundation for all our work to improve Search and answer trillions of queries every year. These elements are what makes Google helpful and reliable for the people who come to us each day to find information.Understanding all the world’s informationWe’re focused on deeply understanding all the world’s information, whether that information is contained in words on web pages, in images or videos, or even in the places and objects around us. With investments in AI, we’re able to analyze and understand all types of information in the world, just as we did by indexing web pages 22 years ago. We’re pushing the boundaries of what it means to understand the world, so before you even type in a query, we’re ready to help you explore new forms of information and insights never before available. The highest quality information People rely on Search for the highest quality information available, and our commitment to quality has always been what set Google apart from day one.

            "Do you know that song that goes, “da daaaa da da daaaa na naa naa ooohh yeah”? Or the one that starts with the guitar chords going, “da na na naa”? We all know how frustrating it is when you can’t remember the name of a song or any of the words but the tune is stuck in your head. Today at Search On, we announced that Google can now help you figure it out—no lyrics, artist name or perfect pitch required. Hum to search for your earwormStarting today, you can hum, whistle or sing a melody to Google to solve your earworm. On your mobile device, open the latest version of the Google app or find your Google Search widget, tap the mic icon and say “what's this song?” or click the “Search a song” button. Then start humming for 10-15 seconds. On Google Assistant, it’s just as simple. Say “Hey Google, what’s this song?” and then hum the tune. This feature is currently available in English on iOS, and in more than 20 languages on Android. And we hope to expand this to more languages in the future.After you’re finished humming, our machine learning algorithm helps identify potential song matches. And don’t worry, you don’t need perfect pitch to use this feature. We’ll show you the most likely options based on the tune. Then you can select the best match and explore information on the song and artist, view any accompanying music videos or listen to the song on your favorite music app, find the lyrics, read analysis and even check out other recordings of the song when available.",
            "How machines learn melodies So how does it work? An easy way to explain it is that a song’s melody is like its fingerprint: They each have their own unique identity. We've built machine learning models that can match your hum, whistle or singing to the right “fingerprint.”When you hum a melody into Search, our machine learning models transform the audio into a number-based sequence representing the song’s melody. Our models are trained to identify songs based on a variety of sources, including humans singing, whistling or humming, as well as studio recordings. The algorithms also take away all the other details, like accompanying instruments and the voice's timbre and tone. What we’re left with is the song’s number-based sequence, or the fingerprint.We compare these sequences to thousands of songs from around the world and identify potential  matches in real time. For example, if you listen to Tones and I’s “Dance Monkey,” you’ll recognize the song whether it was sung, whistled, or hummed. Similarly, our machine learning models recognize the melody of the studio-recorded version of the song, which we can use to match it with a person’s hummed audio. This builds on the work of our Research team’s music recognition technology. We launched Now Playing on the Pixel 2 in 2017, using deep neural networks to bring low-power recognition of music to mobile devices. In 2018, we brought the same technology to the SoundSearch feature in the Google app and expanded the reach to a catalog of millions of songs. This new experience takes it a step further, because now we can recognize songs without the lyrics or original song. All we need is a hum.",
            "So next time you can’t remember the name of some catchy song you heard on the radio or that classic jam your parents love, just start humming. You’ll have your answer in record time."

            "Whether you’re a student learning about photosynthesis or a parent researching the best cars for your growing family, people turn to Google with all sorts of curiosities. And we can help you understand in different ways—through text, your voice or even your phone’s camera. Today, as part of the SearchOn event, we’re announcing new ways you can use Google Lens and augmented reality (AR) while learning and shopping.",
            "Visual tools to help you learn For many families, adjusting to remote learning hasn’t been easy, but tools like Google Lens can help lighten the load. With Lens, you can search what you see using your camera. Lens can now recognize 15 billion things—up from 1 billion just two years ago—to help you identify plants, animals, landmarks and more. If you’re learning a new language, Lens can also translate more than 100 languages, such as Spanish and Arabic, and you can tap to hear words and sentences pronounced out loud. If you’re a parent, your kids may ask you questions about things you never thought you’d need to remember, like quadratic equations. From the search bar in the Google app on Android and iOS, you can use Lens to get help on a homework problem. With step-by-step guides and videos, you can learn and understand the foundational concepts to solve math, chemistry, biology and physics problems.",
            "Sometimes, seeing is understanding. For instance, visualizing the inner workings of a plant cell or the elements in the periodic table in 3D is more helpful than reading about them in a textbook. AR brings hands-on learning home, letting you explore concepts up close in your space. Here’s how Melissa Brophy-Plasencio, an educator from Texas, is incorporating AR into her lesson plans.",
            "Shop what you see with Google Lens Another area where the camera can be helpful is shopping—especially when what you’re looking for is hard to describe in words. With Lens, you can already search for a product by taking a photo or screenshot. Now, we’re making it even easier to discover new products as you browse online on your phone. When you tap and hold an image on the Google app or Chrome on Android, Lens will find the exact or similar items, and suggest ways to style it. This feature is coming soon to the Google app on iOS.",
            "Lens uses Style Engine technology which combines the world’s largest database of products with millions of style images. Then, it pattern matches to understand concepts like “ruffle sleeves” or “vintage denim” and how they pair with different apparel.",
            "Bring the showroom to you with ARWhen you can’t go into stores to check out a product up close, AR can bring the showroom to you. If you’re in the market for a new car, for example, you’ll soon be able to search for it on Google and see an AR model right in front of you. You can easily check out what the car looks like in different colors, zoom in to see intricate details like buttons on the dashboard, view it against beautiful backdrops and even see it in your driveway. We’re experimenting with this feature in the U.S. and working with top auto brands, such as Volvo and Porsche, to bring these experiences to you soon.",
            "Everyone’s journey to understand is different. Whether you snap a photo with Lens or immerse yourself in AR, we hope you find what you’re looking for...",
            "...and even have some fun along the way."

        "heading": "How Google autocomplete predictions are generated",
        "imp_heading": "Search",
        "Publish Date": "Oct 08, 2020",
        "article_paragraphs": [
            "You come to Google with an idea of what you’d like to search for. As soon as you start typing, predictions appear in the search box to help you finish what you’re typing. These time-saving predictions are from a feature called Autocomplete, which we covered previously in this How Search Works series.In this post, we’ll explore how Autocomplete’s predictions are automatically generated based on real searches and how this feature helps you finish typing the query you already had in mind. We’ll also look at why not all predictions are helpful, and what we do in those cases.Where predictions come fromAutocomplete predictions reflect searches that have been done on Google. To determine what predictions to show, our systems begin by looking at common and trending queries that match what someone starts to enter into the search box. For instance, if you were to type in “best star trek…”, we’d look for the common completions that would follow, such as “best star trek series” or “best star trek episodes.”",
            "That’s how predictions work at the most basic level. However, there’s much more involved. We don’t just show the most common predictions overall. We also consider things like the language of the searcher or where they are searching from, because these make predictions far more relevant. Below, you can see predictions for those searching for “driving test” in the U.S. state of California versus the Canadian province of Ontario. Predictions differ in naming relevant locations or even spelling “centre” correctly for Canadians rather than using the American spelling of “center.”",
            "To provide better predictions for long queries, our systems may automatically shift from predicting an entire search to portions of a search. For example, we might not see a lot of queries for “the name of the thing at the front” of some particular object. But we do see a lot of queries for “the front of a ship” or “the front of a boat” or “the front of a car.” That’s why we’re able to offer these predictions toward the end of what someone is typing.",
            "We also take freshness into account when displaying predictions. If our automated systems detect there’s rising interest in a topic, they might show a trending prediction even if it isn’t typically the most common of all related predictions that we know about. For example, searches for a basketball team are probably more common than individual games. However, if that team just won a big face-off against a rival, timely game-related predictions may be more useful for those seeking information that’s relevant in that moment.Predictions also will vary, of course, depending on the specific topic that someone is searching for. People, places and things all have different attributes that people are interested in. For example, someone searching for “trip to New York” might see a prediction of “trip to New York for Christmas,” as that’s a popular time to visit that city. In contrast, “trip to San Francisco” may show a prediction of “trip to San Francisco and Yosemite.” Even if two topics seem to be similar or fall into similar categories, you won’t always see the same predictions if you try to compare them.  Predictions will reflect the queries that are unique and relevant to a particular topic.Overall, Autocomplete is a complex time-saving feature that’s not simply displaying the most common queries on a given topic. That’s also why it differs from and shouldn’t be compared against Google Trends, which is a tool for journalists and anyone else who’s interested to research the popularity of searches and search topics over time.Predictions you likely won’t seePredictions, as explained, are meant to be helpful ways for you to more quickly finish completing something you were about to type. But like anything, predictions aren’t perfect. There’s the potential to show unexpected or shocking predictions. It’s also possible that people might take predictions as assertions of facts or opinions. We also recognize that some queries are less likely to lead to reliable content.We deal with these potential issues in two ways. First and foremost, we have systems designed to prevent potentially unhelpful and policy-violating predictions from appearing. Secondly, if  our automated systems don’t catch predictions that violate our policies, we have enforcement teams that remove predictions in accordance with those policies.Our systems are designed to recognize terms and phrases that might be violent, sexually-explicit, hateful, disparaging or dangerous. When we recognize that such content might surface in a particular prediction, our systems prevent it from displaying. People can still search for such topics using those words, of course. Nothing prevents that. We’re simply not wanting to unintentionally shock or surprise people with predictions they might not have expected.Using our automated systems, we can also recognize if a prediction is unlikely to return much reliable content. For example, after a major news event, there can be any number of unconfirmed rumors or information spreading, which we would not want people to think Autocomplete is somehow confirming. In these cases, our systems identify if there’s likely to be reliable content on a particular topic for a particular search. If that likelihood is low, the systems might automatically prevent a prediction from appearing. But again, this doesn’t stop anyone from completing a search on their own, if they wish.While our automated systems typically work very well, they don’t catch everything. This is why we have policies for Autocomplete, which we publish for anyone to read. Our systems aim to prevent policy-violating predictions from appearing. But if any such predictions do get past our systems, and we’re made aware (such as through public reporting options), our enforcement teams work to review and remove them, as appropriate. In these cases, we remove both the specific prediction in question and often use pattern-matching and other methods to catch closely-related variations.As an example of all this in action, consider our policy about names in Autocomplete, which began in 2016. It’s designed to prevent showing offensive, hurtful or inappropriate queries in relation to named individuals, so that people aren’t potentially forming an impression about others solely off predictions.  We have systems that aim to prevent these types of predictions from showing for name queries. But if violations do get through, we remove them in line with our policies. You can always search for what you wantHaving discussed why some predictions might not appear, it’s also helpful to remember that predictions are not search results. Occasionally, people concerned about predictions for a particular query might suggest that we’re preventing actual search results from appearing. This is not the case. Autocomplete policies only apply to predictions. They do not apply to search results. We understand that our protective systems may prevent some useful predictions from showing. In fact, our systems take a particularly cautious approach when it comes to names and might prevent some non-policy violating predictions from appearing. However, we feel that taking this cautious approach is best. That’s especially because even if a prediction doesn’t appear, this does not impact the ability for someone to finish typing a query on their own and finding search results. We hope this has helped you understand more about how we generate predictions that allow you to more quickly complete the query you started, whether that’s while typing on your laptop or swiping the on-screen keyboard on your phone."

            "On the morning of September 10, millions of people in Northern California woke up to an orange sky after wildfire smoke spread like a thick layer across the West Coast. It persisted for days, and it was the first time lots of people had ever seen something like this. To understand what was happening, many people turned to Search. According to Google Trends, searches for “why is the sky orange” hit an all-time high this month in the United States. As you can see in the graph below, this wasn't a totally new query. There are many pages on the web with general scientific explanations of what can cause the sky to turn orange. But people wanted to know why, in that moment, where they were, the sky was tangerine tinted.",
            "So how does Google respond to a query spike like this? Well, language understanding is at the core of Search, but it’s not just about the words. Critical context, like time and place, also helps us understand what you’re really looking for. This is particularly true for featured snippets, a feature in Search that highlights pages that our systems determine are likely a great match for your search. We’ve made improvements to better understand when fresh or local information -- or both -- is key to delivering relevant results to your search. In the case of the orange sky phenomenon, for people in Northern California, the time and location was really important to understanding what these searches were looking for. Our freshness indicators identified a rush of new content was being produced on this topic that was both locally relevant and different from the more evergreen content that existed. This signaled to our systems to ignore most of the specifics that they previously understood about the topic of “orange sky”--like the relation to a sunset--but to retain broad associations like “air” and “ocean” that were still relevant. In a matter of minutes, our systems learned this new pattern and provided fresh featured snippet results for people looking for this locally relevant information in the Bay Area.",
            "Put simply, instead of surfacing general information on what causes a sunset, when people searched for “why is the sky orange” during this time period, our systems automatically pulled in current, location-based information to help people find the timely results they were searching for. Over the course of the week, we saw even more examples of these systems at work. As a residual effect of the wildfires, New York City and Massachusetts started experiencing a hazy sky. But that wasn’t the case in all states. So for a query like “why is it hazy?” local context was similarly important for providing a relevant result.",
            "For this query, people in New York found an explanation of how the wildfire smoke was caught in a jet stream, which caused the haze to move east. People in Boston would have found a similar feature snippet, but specific to the conditions in that city. And those in Alaska, who were not impacted, would not see these same results. These are just two of billions of queries we get each day, and as new searches arise and information in the world changes, we’ll continue to provide fresh, relevant results in these moments."

            "One of my favorite Google tools is the Google Books Ngram Viewer, or “Ngrams.” Originally created in 2009 by part of the Google Books team, Ngrams shows how books and other pieces of literature have used certain words or phrases over time. You can chart the rise (and fall) of colloquialisms like “sockdollager” or “take the egg”—or even “that slaps.” “Ngrams simply aggregates the use of words or phrases across the entire Google Books dataset,” says Michael Ballbach, a software engineer who works on Google Books. “It then allows users to graph the usage of those words or phrases through time.” Each word being searched is a “gram” that the tool searches across its database. Ngrams’s capabilities have grown recently, thanks to an update in 2019 that added approximately 19 million more books to its dataset. “For the English language corpus, that adds trillions of words,” Michael says. For context, that’s roughly the equivalent of three million copies of “War and Peace!”But there’s one phrase—er, four grams—that’s been surfacing more and more during these...challenging, unprecedented, uncertain, unusual times that I’m particularly interested in: “Now more than ever.” Perhaps you’ve even noticed it? “Now more than ever” has invaded our vernacular; in fact, I’m sure you’ve read it (or a similar phrase) in a Keyword post or two. So I decided to dive into Ngrams to see if “now more than ever” is showing up...now more than ever. While we’re currently experiencing a spike, there have been others: In the early 1940s, around 1915-1920 and in 1866. Between 1805-1809 it was particularly high—nearly as high as it is today.  And then of course there was the banner year of 1752, when things peaked for “now more than ever.”",
            "Today, as we’re living through a pandemic, wildfires, racial injustice and so, so much more, it feels obvious why we’re increasingly saying and hearing “now more than ever,” but what about back then? What things made people feel like everything had a certain crucialness? While the Ngrams team doesn’t investigate the causes of the booms and busts of words and phrases, for this particular exercise, I thought a little about what could have possibly been happening during these periods of “now more than ever.” I can imagine in the 1940s, World War II changed the lives of people everwhere. 1915-1920 was marked by World War I—and of course, the influenza pandemic of 1918. In 1866, the United States was emerging from civil war. 1805 to 1809 was a heady time for the young U.S. government.“If you have the time or inclination, you can use Books Search to try and get some insights,” Michael explains. So I plugged in “now more than ever,” searched under Books, and toggled the time settings for 1751 to 1753 to try and see if I could glean anything about the peak year of 1752. And while I can’t say I know what about that time really pushed the “now more than everness,” a handful of British literary journals were definitely using the phrase. But things don’t stay at a “now more than ever” pitch. From 1955 to 1996, “now more than ever” was relatively uncommon, before climbing steeply up through the late 90s and early aughts to today. Maybe you, like me, may find some comfort in knowing that this moment in time—as unprecedented, challenging and uncertain as it may be—is not the only one in which everything is “now more than ever.” Maybe you, too, can appreciate the light Ngrams sheds on the lives of the words we choose. “I think that language is evolving just like society is evolving. That is, language is a reflection of the society that used it, and vice versa,” Michael says. “How the use of language changes over time reflects at least some of the changes taking place in the wider world. Having better tools to look at one can hopefully lead to insights in the other.” And if you’re feeling very “now more than ever,” just remember: This too shall pass."

That's why we share high-level data and insights about fast-rising travel categories in Google Search like domestic vacations (with search terms like “country holiday” or “car hire near me”); where in the world searches are growing; and the queries associated with them. Our data and analyses, available on our Think with Google site, can help tourism businesses identify new trends in consumer preferences. For example, as people increasingly search for local and outdoor tourism, businesses can react to these changing needs by doing marketing campaigns that highlight nature destinations, and they can prepare for an uptick in last-minute bookings.",
            "Partnering with tourism ministries, travel experts and the travel business sector We're partnering with government ministries, businesses and experts throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa to foster digital skills in the travel sector. For example, we’ve worked with the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) to train tourism officials and businesses on a range of digital tools to engage travellers at home, and encourage future travel when possible. And our first UN & Google Tourism Acceleration Program will take place virtually this Wednesday, September 23, designed for UN member states' tourism ministers, top travel associations, tourism boards and destination marketing organizations. It will focus on travel and tourism insights from South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria so participants can better understand shifts in behavior and adapt their products and offerings to meet new demands.To further support  new solutions in the sector, Google for Startups Spain is launching a Growth Academy for TravelTech startups. The eleven selected businesses will partner with experts from Google to develop tailored strategies for acquiring new customers and partnerships to grow their businesses.We also partnered with Atout France, the France tourism development agency, to share demand and consumer trends with their members, and we co-conducted digital marketing webinars for more than 600 French travel businesses and organizations to support their recovery efforts.And in Greece, we launched #greecefromhome, an at-home continuation of Grow Greek Tourism Online, a digital skills program in partnership with the Greek Ministry of Tourism. #greecefromhome gave virtual tours of Greece and provided free digital skills training for over 6,000 Greek tourism businesses during the lockdown. This builds on our efforts to support the tourism sector across the region, helping them grow with digital tools, get access to training and digitize their heritage. While this World Tourism Day marks a uniquely challenging period for tourism, it’s also an opportunity to prepare and find new ways to engage with would-be travellers. We remain optimistic about the travel industry’s future, and about the role that our tools can play to help it recover."

            "For many people, Google Search is a place they go when they want to find information about a question, whether it’s to learn more about an issue, or fact check a friend quoting a stat about your favorite team. We get billions of queries every day, and one of the reasons people continue to come to Google is they know that they can often find relevant, reliable information that they can trust.Delivering a high-quality search experience is core to what makes Google so helpful. From the early days when we introduced the PageRank algorithm, understanding the quality of web content was what set Google apart from other search engines.But people often ask: What do you mean by quality, and how do you figure out how to ensure that the information people find on Google is reliable?A simple way to think about it is that there are three key elements to our approach to information quality:First, we fundamentally design our ranking systems to identify information that people are likely to find useful and reliable. To complement those efforts, we also have developed a number of Search features that not only help you make sense of all the information you’re seeing online, but that also provide direct access to information from authorities—like health organizations or government entities. Finally, we have policies for what can appear in Search features to make sure that we’re showing high quality and helpful content.With these three approaches, we’re able to continue to improve Search and raise the bar on quality to deliver a trusted experience for people around the world. Let’s take a closer look at how we approach each of these areas.Orienting our ranking systems around quality To understand what results are most relevant to your query, we have a variety of language understanding systems that aim to match the words and concepts in your query with related information in our index. This ranges from systems that understand things like misspellings or synonyms, to more advanced AI-based systems like our BERT-based language capabilities that can understand more complex, natural-language queries. Updates to our language understanding systems certainly make Search results more relevant and improve the experience overall. But when it comes to high-quality, trustworthy information, even with our advanced information understanding capabilities, search engines like Google do not understand content the way humans do. We often can’t tell from the words or images alone if something is exaggerated, incorrect, low-quality or otherwise unhelpful.Instead, search engines largely understand the quality of content through what are commonly called “signals.” You can think of these as clues about the characteristics of a page that align with what humans might interpret as high quality or reliable. For example, the number of quality pages that link to a particular page is a signal that a page may be a trusted source of information on a topic.We consider a variety of other quality signals, and to understand if our mixture of quality signals is working, we run a lot of tests. We have more than 10,000 search quality raters, people who collectively perform millions of sample searches and rate the quality of the results according to how well they measure up against what we call E-A-T: Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness. Raters, following instructions anyone can read in our Search Quality Rater Guidelines, evaluate results for sample queries and assess how well the pages listed appear to demonstrate these characteristics of quality.We recently explained the search rater process in more depth, but it’s worth noting again the ratings we receive are not used directly in our ranking algorithms. Instead, ratings provide data that, when taken in aggregate, help us measure how well our systems are working to deliver quality content that’s aligned with how people—across the country and around the world—evaluate information. This data helps us to improve our systems and ensure we’re delivering high quality results.For topics where quality information is particularly important—like health, finance, civic information, and crisis situations—we place an even greater emphasis on factors related to expertise and trustworthiness. We’ve learned that sites that demonstrate authoritativeness and expertise on a topic are less likely to publish false or misleading information, so if we can build our systems to identify signals of those characteristics, we can continue to provide reliable information. The design of these systems is our greatest defense against low-quality content, including potential misinformation, and is work that we’ve been investing in for many years.Info from experts, right in SearchIn most cases, our ranking systems do a very good job of making it easy to find relevant and reliable information from the open web, particularly for topics like health, or in times of crisis. But in these areas, we also develop features to make information from authoritative organizations like local governments, health agencies and elections commissions available directly on Search.For example, we’ve long had knowledge panels in Search with information about health conditions and symptoms, vetted by medical experts. More recently, we saw a significant increase in people searching for information about unemployment benefits, so we worked with administrative agencies to highlight details about eligibility and how to access this civic service. And for many years, we’ve offered features that help you find out how to vote and where your polling place is. Through the Google Civic Information API, we help other sites and services make this information available across the web. This type of information is not always easy to find, especially in rapidly changing situations, so features like these help ensure people get critical guidance when they need it most.Helping you understand information you seeFor many searches, people aren’t necessarily looking for a quick fact, but rather to understand a more complex topic. We also know that people come to Search having heard information elsewhere, with the aim of seeing what others are saying to form their own opinion.In these cases, we want to give people tools to make sense of the information they’re seeing online, to find reliable sources and explore the full picture about a topic. For example, we make it easy to spot fact checks in Search, News, and now in Google Images by displaying fact check labels. These labels come from publishers that use ClaimReview schema to mark up fact checks they have published. For years now we’ve offered Full Coverage on Google News and Search, helping people explore and understand how stories have evolved and explore different angles and perspectives.Protecting Search features through policiesWe also offer more general Search features, like knowledge panels, featured snippets and Autocomplete, that highlight and organize information in unique ways or predict queries you might want to do. Because of the way these features highlight information in Search, we hold ourselves to a very high standard for quality and have guidelines around what content should appear in those spaces.Within these features, we first and foremost design our automated ranking systems to show helpful content. But our systems aren’t always perfect. So if our systems fail to prevent policy-violating content from appearing, our enforcement team will take action in accordance with our policies. To learn more about how we approach policies for our search features, visit this post.

            "Delivering high-quality results is what has always set Google apart from other search engines, even in our earliest days. Over the years as the product and user experience have evolved, our investments in quality have accelerated. We conduct extensive testing to ensure that Search is as helpful as it can be—from the quality of information we deliver, to the overall experience. Since 2017, we’ve done more than 1 million search quality tests, and we now average more than 1,000 tests per day. In addition to investing in the overall Search experience, we also focus on providing reliable information for people everywhere. We’ve highlighted our fundamental approach and ongoing investment in this area, but we also wanted to share some of the new improvements we’ve made to continue to deliver high quality information.In a year when access to reliable information is more critical than ever—from COVID-19 to natural disasters to important moments of civic participation around the world—our longstanding commitment to quality remains at the core of our mission to make the world’s information accessible and useful. New insights from our Intelligence DeskWith new things happening around the world every day, the information landscape can change quickly. To understand how our systems are performing when news breaks, we’ve developed an Intelligence Desk, which actively monitors and identifies potential information threats. This effort grew out of our Crisis Response team, which for years has done real-time tracking of events around the world, launching SOS Alerts in Search and Maps to help people get vital information quickly. Over the years, we’ve monitored thousands of events and launched hundreds of alerts to help keep people safe.",
            "The Intelligence Desk is a global team of analysts monitoring news events 24/7, spanning natural disasters and crises, breaking news moments and the latest developments in ongoing topics like COVID. When events occur, our analysts collect data about how our systems are responding and compile reports about narratives that are emerging, like new claims about COVID treatments. Our product teams use these data sets and reports from the Intelligence Desk to run more robust quality tests and ensure that our systems are working as intended for the wide range of topics people Search for.Improving our systems for breaking news and crisesAs news is developing, the freshest information published to the web isn’t always the most accurate or trustworthy, and people’s need for information can accelerate faster than facts can materialize. Over the past few years, we’ve improved our systems to automatically recognize breaking news around crisis moments like natural disasters and ensure we’re returning the most authoritative information available. We’ve also made significant strides in our overall ability to accurately identify breaking news moments, and do so more quickly. We’ve improved our detection time from up to 40 minutes just a few years ago, to now within just a few minutes of news breaking.",
            "Our improvements in detecting crisis events expands on our work in 2017 to improve the quality of results for topics that might be susceptible to hateful, offensive and misleading information. Those improvements remain fundamental to how we handle low-quality information in Search and News products, and since then, we’ve continuously updated our systems to be able to detect topic areas that may be at risk for misinformation. We’re continuing to train and test our systems to ensure that whatever people are searching for, they can find reliable information.Providing accurate information from the Knowledge GraphIn Search, features like knowledge panels that display information from the Google Knowledge Graph help you get quick access to the facts from sources across the web. To deliver high-quality information in these features, we’ve deepened our partnerships with government agencies, health organizations and Wikipedia to ensure reliable, accurate information is available, and protect against potential vandalism.For COVID-19, we worked with health organizations around the world to provide local guidance and information to keep people safe. To respond to emerging information needs, like the surge we saw in people searching for unemployment benefits, we provide easy access to information right from government agencies in the U.S. and other countries. For elections information, we work with non-partisan civic organizations that provide authoritative information about voting methods, candidates, election results and more.Information in knowledge panels comes from hundreds of sources, and one of the most comprehensive knowledge bases is Wikipedia. Volunteer Wikipedia editors around the world have created robust systems to guard for neutrality and accuracy. They use machine learning tools paired with intricate human oversight to spot and address vandalism. Most vandalism on Wikipedia is reverted within a matter of minutes.",
            "To complement Wikipedia’s systems, we’ve added additional protections and detection systems to prevent potentially inaccurate information from appearing in knowledge panels. On rare occasions, instances of vandalism on Wikipedia can slip through. Only a small proportion of edits from Wikipedia are potential vandalism, and we’ve improved our systems to now detect 99 percent of those cases. If these issues do appear, we have policies that allow us to take action quickly to address them.To further support the Wikipedia community, we created the WikiLoop program last year that hosts several editor tools focused on content quality. This includes WikiLoop DoubleCheck, one of a number tools Wikipedia editors and users can use to track changes on a page and flag potential issues. We contribute data from our own detection systems, which members of the community can use to uncover new insights.  Helpful context from fact checks and Full CoverageWe design Search and News to help you see the full picture, by helping you easily understand the context behind information you might find online. We make it easy to spot fact checks in Search, News and, most recently, Google Images by displaying fact check labels. These fact checks and labels come from publishers that use ClaimReview schema to mark up fact checks they have created. This year to date, people have seen fact checks on Search and News more than 4 billion times, which is more than all of 2019 combined. We understand the importance of the fact checking ecosystem in debunking misleading information, which is why we recently donated an additional $6.5 million to help fact checking organizations and nonprofits focus on misinformation about the pandemic.We also just launched an update using our BERT language understanding models to improve the matching between news stories and available fact checks. These systems can better understand whether a fact check claim is related to the central topic of a story, and surface those fact checks more prominently in Full Coverage—a News feature that provides a complete picture of how a story is reported from a variety of sources. With just a tap, Full Coverage lets you see top headlines from different sources, videos, local news reports, FAQs, social commentary, and a timeline for stories that have played out over time.Expanded protections for Search featuresWe have policies for what can appear in Search features like featured snippets, lists or  video previews that uniquely highlight information on the search results page. One notable example is Autocomplete, which helps you complete your search more quickly.We have long-standing policies to protect against hateful and inappropriate predictions from appearing in Autocomplete. We design our systems to approximate those policies automatically, and have improved our automated systems to not show predictions if we detect that the query may not lead to reliable content. These systems are not perfect or precise, so we enforce our policies if predictions slip through.We expanded our Autocomplete policies related to elections, and we will remove predictions that could be interpreted as claims for or against any candidate or political party. We will also remove predictions that could be interpreted as a claim about participation in the election—like statements about voting methods, requirements, or the status of voting locations—or the integrity or legitimacy of electoral processes, such as the security of the election. What this means in practice is that predictions like “you can vote by phone” as well as “you can't vote by phone,” or a prediction that says “donate to” any party or candidate, should not appear in Autocomplete. Whether or not a prediction appears, you can still search for whatever you’d like and find results. Information online is constantly changing—as are the things people search for—so continuing to deliver high-quality information is an area of ongoing investment. We’ve made great strides and built upon successful improvements to our systems, and we’ll continue to look for new ways to make Search and News as reliable and helpful as possible, no matter what you’re looking for."

            "Typically, fashion changes with the seasons. In the fall, you see boots and flannels appear; in winter, we break out the cable knit sweaters. Come spring, light jackets start showing up, and summer means it’s time for shorts and sandals. But this year, I’ve been wearing a nearly uninterrupted uniform of workout clothes since March.I wanted to see how widespread the effect of quarantine was on personal style, so I turned to Google Trends to find out. Here’s a look at some of the latest fashion-related Google Trends that people are searching for:While searching for shorts seems like the status quo for hot summer months, according to Google Trends, search interest in “shorts” reached an all-time high this June in the U.S. More specifically, “biker shorts” was the most searched type of shorts over the past three months (interestingly, we also saw an increase in search interest for “cycling” in March). “Biker shorts” was followed by “short shorts,” “running shorts” (my personal faves)—though “denim shorts” and “cargo shorts” followed next, so apparently there is still some interest in “real” clothes out there.One garment has remained buried in my dresser for quite some time now: pants. So I wasn’t surprised to see that while search interest in pants isn’t currently at an all-time low, there was a significant dip in the U.S. in March...which certainly corresponds with the period of time that sheltering in place caused me to move in a comfier direction. Meanwhile, even though much of the U.S. is currently experiencing warmer temps, search interest in “sweatpants” has been much higher this summer than it was the previous two years; same goes for pajamas:",
            "Of course, pre-quarantine fashion pieces have taken a hit: Searches for wedding dresses, tuxedos and neckties are all down. Heels haven't gotten much love in recent months, either. U.S. search interest in “high-heeled shoe” hit a 10-year low in April of this year. On the flipside, in May “running shoes” hit an all-time high. But what about new fashion trends that sheltering in place has inspired? You may have seen social media feeds consumed with the idea of the nap dress—a dress you can both wear while going about your day (whether that be running errands or just working from home) as well as...well, for napping. “Nap dress” saw an all-time high in search interest in July in the U.S.Here’s to my—and maybe your—most casual summer on record."

            "Search is often where people come to get answers on health and wellbeing, whether it’s to find a doctor or treatment center, or understand a symptom better just before a doctor's visit. In the past, researchers have used Google Search data to gauge the health impact of heatwaves, improve prediction models for influenza-like illnesses, and monitor Lyme disease incidence. Today we’re making available a dataset of search trends for researchers to study the link between symptom-related searches and the spread of COVID-19. We hope this data could lead to a better understanding of the pandemic’s impact.",
            "How search trends can support COVID-19 research The COVID-19 Search Trends symptoms dataset includes aggregated, anonymized search trends for more than 400 symptoms, signs and health conditions, such as cough, fever and difficulty breathing. The dataset includes trends at the U.S. county-level from the past three years in order to make the insights more helpful to public health, and so researchers can account for changes in searches due to seasonality.Public health currently uses a range of datasets to track and forecast the spread of COVID-19. Researchers could use this dataset to study if search trends can provide an earlier and more accurate indication of the reemergence of the virus in different parts of the country. And since measures such as shelter-in-place have reduced the accessibility of care and affected people’s wellbeing more generally, this dataset—which covers a broad range of symptoms and conditions, from diabetes to stress—could also be useful in studying the secondary health effects of the pandemic.The dataset is available in Google Cloud's COVID-19 Free Public Dataset Program and is downloadable in CSV format from Google Research at Open COVID-19 Data GitHub repository.",
            "Advancing health research with privacy protectionsThe COVID-19 Search Trends symptoms dataset is powered by the same anonymization technology that we use in the Community Mobility Reports and other Google products every day. No personal information or individual search queries are included. The dataset was produced using differential privacy, a state-of-the-art technique that adds random noise to the data to provide privacy guarantees while preserving the overall quality of the data.Similar to Google Trends, the data is normalized based on a symptom’s relative popularity, allowing researchers to study spikes in search interest over different time periods, without exposing any individual query or even the number of queries in any given area. More information about the privacy methods used to generate the dataset can be found in this report.",
            "What’s nextThis early release is limited to the United States and covers searches made in English and Spanish. It covers all states and many counties, where the available data meets quality and privacy thresholds. It was developed to specifically aid research on COVID-19, so we intend to make the dataset available for the duration of the pandemic. As we receive feedback from public health researchers, civil society groups and the community at large, we’ll evaluate and expand this dataset by including additional countries and regions. Researchers and public health experts are doing incredible work to respond to the pandemic. We hope this dataset will be useful in their work towards stopping the spread of COVID-19."

            "Google Images is a great place to find visual inspiration and useful web pages to help make your ideas a reality. Sometimes, bringing your ideas to life requires finding an image you can use—like when you’re looking to communicate a message, decorate a space or do something creative on the web. But with a seemingly infinite number of images online, finding the right image to use, and knowing how to use that image responsibly, isn’t always a simple task. After collaborating closely with image creators, stock image providers and digital content associations, we’re launching several new features on Google Images to address this need. These features will make finding the right image to use, as well as guidelines for how to license an image for your business or personal project, much easier than before.First, we’re making it easier to find licensable images. For results where the publisher or image creator provided licensing information, we will display a “licensable” badge over the image. When you select a badged image to view, we will show a link to the license details of the image, and if provided by the publisher, you’ll also find a link to where you can purchase or license the image.",

            "In moments like a growing wildfire or a trembling earthquake, having access to high-quality information and actionable safety tips is critical. The American Red Cross and their Global Disaster Preparedness Center developed an open sourced platform for developers called the WhatNow Service—a data feed of global safety tips for over 20 different disaster types. Supported by a $250,000 Google.org grant, the Red Cross translated these safety tips and adapted the recommendations based on local context and risk.To make this information even more accessible, when people come to Google Search looking for information about a natural disaster near them, they’ll now find these localized safety tips in the SOS alerts we show during times of crisis.",
            "We sat down to talk with Omar Abou-Samra, who leads the Red Cross’s Global Disaster Preparedness Center, to learn more about the development of these safety tips and how technology has changed the way people prepare for natural disasters.Related: Mapping wildfires with the power of satellite data",
            "Can you share a bit about the process behind how safety recommendations are developed?We’ve worked with social scientists, climate scientists, behavioral researchers and humanitarian aid professionals to identify key messages and actions that people can take before, during and after a crisis. The blend of practical experience with scientific and social research has yielded simple and actionable safety messages that people can trust in the event of an emergency like an earthquake, wildfire, hurricane or flash flood. Sometimes these are simple actions like listening for more information from local authorities or following evacuation orders. Other messages are practical things like moving valuables to safety if you’re near an area that may flood or preparing an emergency kit to keep nearby.How do you ensure these safety tips are relevant for people across multiple countries?We work with a network of 192 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the globe—each one operates in its own language, and understands unique local challenges and needs. We gave each partner a set of standard, evidence-based messages for 20 different hazards across 6 different time scales (mitigation, seasonal forecast, watch, warning, immediate, and recovery). This localization process included consultation with their government partners to finalize the messages that we’re sharing with the public.How, if at all, have these recommendations changed with the impact of COVID-19?As one example, safety tips now advise having additional items in emergency kits—such as hand sanitizer and cloth face coverings. It will be important to have these on hand so that people can continue being safe, and keeping their neighbors safe, in case they need to evacuate their homes and stay in close proximity to others.What are some of the top challenges in communicating disaster safety information to the public?Trust and consistency are two of the biggest challenges. Every person accesses information through  many different channels. There’s a high volume of content to navigate, which can leave people confused or even unaware of what to do when there is an emergency. With the Red Cross safety messages that can be delivered through Google SOS alerts and by an API to other channels, we’re offering consistent, evidence-based safety messages prepared by a trusted source.Now that we’re in hurricane and wildfire seasons, what’s the number one piece of advice you can give to readers to stay safe? The most important thing is to have a plan and make sure you and your loved ones know what to do when there’s an emergency. This includes identifying a trusted source of information, knowing and practicing the steps you will take in an emergency and identifying the items and must-haves you may need for your recovery."

The team started searching the web to learn more. And while we did find some details confirming what we already knew—a large fire was taking place outside of our door—we experienced a potentially life-impacting information gap.",
            "This kick-started our journey to build features in Google Search and other products that connect people with high-quality information during crises. A few hours after I took the photo below, we quickly launched a small feature in Search that made it easier for people to find the emergency hotline for the Carmel Mountain fire. Since then, we’ve continued to evolve and expand off this initial launch into the SOS alerts we launched in 2017.",
            "Connecting people to critical information during active wildfiresToday we’re launching a new wildfire boundary map in Search and Maps SOS alerts in the U.S. to provide deeper insights for areas impacted by an ongoing wildfire. In moments like a growing wildfire, knowing exactly where a blaze is underway and how to avoid it is critical. Using satellite data to create a wildfire boundary map, people will now see the approximate size and location right on their phone or desktop. When people look for a specific fire like \"Pine Gulch fire\" or “Apple fire” in Search, they will be able to see a wildfire’s approximate boundary of the fire, name and location, as well as news articles and helpful resources from local emergency agencies in the SOS alert. On Google Maps, people will have access to the same details, including the fire boundary, and receive warnings if they’re approaching an active blaze. If someone is exploring an area near a wildfire on Google Maps, they’ll get an ambient alert that will point them to the latest information.Related: Natural disaster safety tips: a Q&A with the Red Cross",
            "How we map fires to help keep people safe With satellite data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) GOES constellation of satellites and Google Earth Engine’s data analysis capabilities, we’re now able to show the size of a wildfire in near real time, with data being refreshed roughly every hour. NOAA’s satellites include infrared and optical sensors optimized for detecting “hot spots” or large wildfires on the Earth’s surface. We run computations on this data in Earth Engine to identify the affected area.",
            "From there, we create a digital polygon—the red boundary shown on the map in Search and Google Maps—that represents the approximate wildfire impact area. If multiple large fires are active in the same region, people may see several polygons. You can learn more about how we gather, analyze and visualize wildfire data from satellites on our Medium blog.",
            "Putting this information to work This year the National Interagency Fire Center has predicted above normal fire risks for several areas across the U.S. Already, firefighters have confronted large blazes across Northern and Southern California, as well as the Grizzly Creek Fire in Colorado, which led to evacuations and burned thousands of acres. In these situations, having high-quality information at your fingertips matters.For example, in the recent Apple, Pine Gulch, and Grizzly fires, we quickly identified that the wildfires were rapidly expanding, and dry conditions exacerbated the fire, putting thousands of people at risk. We were able to launch our SOS alerts, with the latest boundary map, on Search and Google Maps.",
            "Last year, we piloted this feature in Search for major California wildfires to confirm it was a useful tool for first responders, emergency management personnel and the community. We collaborated with organizations, like the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) and Boulder’s Office of Emergency Management, to gather expert recommendations on wildfire preparedness and response. Their feedback throughout our 2019 pilot helped identify what information is most useful during emergency situations.",
            "Google has been involved in crisis response for many years, starting with the Carmel Mountain Fire in Israel in 2010. Since then, we've initiated Public and SOS alerts for hundreds of thousands of crises around the world. From wildfire mapping, to earthquake detection and alerts to flood forecasting, we continue to find new ways for technology to be helpful at the most critical times."

            "Every Google search you do is one of billions we receive that day. In less than half a second, our systems sort through hundreds of billions of web pages to try and find the most relevant and helpful results available.Because the web and people’s information needs keep changing, we make a lot of improvements to our search algorithms to keep up. Thousands per year, in fact. And we’re always working on new ways to make our results more helpful whether it’s a new feature, or bringing new language understanding capabilities to Search.The improvements we make go through an evaluation process designed so that people around the world continue to find Google useful for whatever they’re looking for. Here are some ways that insights and feedback from people around the world help make Search better.Our research team at workChanges that we make to Search are aimed at making it easier for people to find useful information, but depending on their interests, what language they speak, and where they are in the world, different people have different information needs. It’s our mission to make information universally accessible and useful, and we are committed to serving all of our users in pursuit of that goal.This is why we have a research team whose job it is to talk to people all around the world to understand how Search can be more useful. We invite people to give us feedback on different iterations of our projects and we do field research to understand how people in different communities access information online.For example, we’ve learned over the years about the unique needs and technical limitations that people in emerging markets have when accessing information online. So we developed Google Go, a lightweight search app that works well with less powerful phones and less reliable connections. On Google Go, we’ve also introduced uniquely helpful features, including one that lets you listen to web pages out loud, which is particularly useful for people learning a new language or who may be less comfortable with reading long text. Features like these would not be possible without insights from the people who will ultimately use them.Search quality ratersA key part of our evaluation process is getting feedback from everyday users about whether our ranking systems and proposed improvements are working well. But what do we mean by “working well”? We publish publicly available rater guidelines that describe in great detail how our systems intend to surface great content. These guidelines are more than 160 pages long, but if we have to boil it down to just a phrase, we like to say that Search is designed to return relevant results from the most reliable sources available.Our systems use signals from the web itself—like where words in your search appear on web pages, or how pages link to one another on the web—to understand what information is related to your query and whether it’s information that people tend to trust. But notions of relevance and trustworthiness are ultimately human judgments, so to measure whether our systems are in fact understanding these correctly, we need to gather insights from people.To do this, we have a group of more than 10,000 people all over the world we call “search quality raters.” Raters help us measure how people are likely to experience our results. They provide ratings based on our guidelines and represent real users and their likely information needs, using their best judgment to represent their locale. These people study and are tested on our rater guidelines before they can begin to provide ratings.How rating worksHere’s how a rater task works: we generate a sample of queries (say, a few hundred). A group of raters will be assigned this set of queries, and they’re shown two versions of results pages for those searches. One set of results is from the current version of Google, and the other set is from an improvement we’re considering.Raters review every page listed in the results set and evaluate that page against the query, based on our rater guidelines. They evaluate whether those pages meet the information needs based on their understanding of what that query was seeking, and they consider things like how authoritative and trustworthy that source seems to be on the topic in the query. To evaluate things like expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness—sometimes referred to as “E-A-T”—raters are asked to do reputational research on the sources.Here’s what that looks like in practice: imagine the sample query is “carrot cake recipe.” The results set may include articles from recipe sites, food magazines, food brands and perhaps blogs. To determine if a webpage meets their information needs, a rater might consider how easy the cooking instructions are to understand, how helpful the recipe is in terms of visual instructions and imagery, and whether there are other useful features on the site, like a shopping list creator or calculator for recipe doubling. To understand if the author has subject matter expertise, a rater would do some online research to see if the author has cooking credentials, has been profiled or referenced on other food websites, or has produced other great content that has garnered positive reviews or ratings on recipe sites. Basically, they do some digging to answer questions like: is this page trustworthy, and does it come from a site or author with a good reputation?  Ratings are not used directly for search rankingOnce raters have done this research, they then provide a quality rating for each page. It’s important to note that this rating does not directly impact how this page or site ranks in Search. Nobody is deciding that any given source is “authoritative” or “trustworthy.” In particular, pages are not assigned ratings as a way to determine how well to rank them. Indeed, that would be an impossible task and a poor signal for us to use. With hundreds of billions of pages that are constantly changing, there’s no way humans could evaluate every page on a recurring basis.Instead, ratings are a data point that, when taken in aggregate, helps us measure how well our systems are working to deliver great content that’s aligned with how people—across the country and around the world—evaluate information.Last year alone, we did more than 383,605 search quality tests and 62,937 side-by-side experiments with our search quality raters to measure the quality of our results and help us make more than 3,600 improvements to our search algorithms. In-product experimentsOur research and rater feedback isn’t the only feedback we use when making improvements. We also need to understand how a new feature will work when it’s actually available in Search and people are using it as they would in real life. To make sure we’re able to get these insights, we test how people interact with new features through live experiments.They’re called “live” experiments because they’re actually available to a small proportion of randomly selected people using the current version of Search. To test a change, we will launch a feature to a small percentage of all queries we get, and we look at a number of different metrics to measure the impact.Did people click or tap on the new feature? Did most people just scroll past it? Did it make the page load slower? These insights can help us understand quite a bit about whether a new feature or change is helpful and if people will actually use it.In 2019, we ran more than 17,000 live traffic experiments to test out new features and improvements to Search. If you compare that with how many launches actually happened (around 3600, remember?), you can see that only the best and most useful improvements make it into Search.Always improvingWhile our search results will never be perfect, these research and evaluation processes have proven to be very effective over the past two decades. They allow us to make frequent improvements and ensure that the changes we make represent the needs of people around the world coming to Search for information."

            "Whether you’re a first time home buyer or you’re looking for refinancing information for your current home, the mortgage journey can feel complex and overwhelming. In fact, search interest in “how to buy a house” reached an all-time high in May 2020 in the U.S. and search interest in refinancing reached an all-time high in March. There are several questions to ask and factors to consider, like costs, rates, timing and  loan options. According to Google Trends, the most searched mortgage-related questions in the past year in the U.S. are: What is a mortgage? What is PMI? Should I refinance? What is APR? What is escrow? Buying a house is a big financial decision and having clear, trustworthy information is important. To help people better understand the mortgage process, we collaborated with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to create a new mobile experience in Search. When you search for “mortgage” on your phone, you’ll find a feature that breaks down the complex mortgage process into easy-to-follow steps to help guide you, wherever you may be in the process. It also connects you to a set of useful resources, including news articles, industry definitions and terms, a calculator to assist with payment plans and average mortgage rates. And for those looking for relief and refinance information, we’ll show some of the options available to you.",

            "Find and compare mortgage ratesTo provide more context about the current industry rates, we added a “mortgage rates” section to the feature. You’ll see a breakdown of the average mortgage rates in the market and a graph with daily granularity on rates. You can also compare up to five selected fixed-rate and ARM mortgage plans to understand the options you may have at a variety of rates. This can also be filtered by your location, down payment, credit score and more.",
            "For those impacted by the recent economic downturn searching for mortgage relief or if you are wanting to refinance your current home, we added relief and refinance information from the CFPB and the web to help you explore what options are available to you. Buying a home can be among the most important financial decisions in your life, and having clear, trustworthy information is important. Even though the process can be challenging and it’s a big commitment, we hope these new features can help you find the right path for you."

            "This Fourth of July, the fairground fireworks and pool parties may be put on hold. But there’s one thing we don’t have to cancel: Firing up the grill and hanging out in the backyard. In fact, “4th of July grilling ideas” spiked more than 400 percent in the U.S. within the past week.While many of us will head to our patios and yards, what we’re cooking up varies across the country. According to Google Trends, North Carolinians are searching for “bbq slaw” recipes. And in Oklahoma, they’re looking up “oven baked barbeque catfish.” In Colorado, searches for “bbq chicken recipes” are up. If you’re curious about what your own state is searching for, you can check out this map showing unique \"How to grill...\" searches in each state over the past week.",
            "And if you head to Search and look up “Fourth of July”, you’ll find Cameos from chefs like Alice Randall and Mary Ann Esposito spilling their BBQ secrets and recipes. (During your search, you may find more than culinary advice; check out the homepage for a sparkling new Doodle and Search results...and perhaps some other surprises.)Feeling inspired⁠—or hungry? We also asked Googlers to share their favorite grilling recipes. “Texas Crutch” Smoked BrisketSubmitted by Ryan Ausanka-Crues, Engineering Manager on Android TVMy family is all from Texas so I grew up barbecuing with my grandfather. As such, I don't apologize for using the Texas Crutch (the method of cooking brisket in foil). Plus, it's fun to wait until after people try the brisket to tell them it was made by a vegetarian. Even though I’ve been vegetarian for 20 years, I still enjoy the art and technique of barbecuing with fire.Dry-brine the meat (0.1 oz of salt per pound of beef) at least 24 hours before smoking.Prepare the smoker, then apply big bad beef rub to the meat just before adding to the smoker.Aim to keep smoker between 225 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit (275 degrees if you're using logs instead of charcoal) and add wood chunks to fire every 30 minutes for the first two hours.When the meat hits \"the stall,\" wrap tightly with heavy duty aluminum foil and return to the fire (also known as, the Texas Crutch).Smoke until it reaches an internal temperature of 190 degrees Fahrenheit (about 12 hours).Remove from heat and let sit, still wrapped, until temperature drops below 140 degrees Fahrenheit.Steak and Tenderstem BroccoliSubmitted by Ken Graham, Financial AnalystWhen I first started grilling, I wanted to perfect this popular method of getting the meat as close to the heat as possible. Buy the best quality meat you can afford, about ¾-inch thick is best for this method. Good steak should stand up on it's own, no real sauce or spice needed. I like rib eye, but to each their own.Take the steaks out of the fridge about an hour before you want to cook them, season with salt and then put them back in the fridge.Pat the steaks dry when you take them out of the fridge; water will inhibit the browning of the meat. You want your grill screaming hot, so whack it up to max on all burners. Before you turn it up, take the grates off, and then place one of the grates directly on the bars (if it's gas) or coals (if it's charcoal). Grill your steaks on the grate flipping every minute. Three or four minutes should get you to medium rare, depending on the heat of the grill, but using a meat thermometer is best; you want to get it around 130-135 degrees Fahrenheit.Serve with whatever sides you like, but I like Tenderstem broccoli, which I grill on the grates I used for the steak. They pick up some of the steak flavor and cook quickly but stay crunchy.Wine Can ChickenSubmitted by Helynn Nelson, People Consultant and Nekosi Nelson, Staffing LeadThis recipe is one of the first experimental dishes my husband, Kosi, cooked 15 years ago when we were newlyweds and it gets better and better with time. He’s allowed me to co-opt his recipe a bit by introducing one of my favorite ingredients...wine! I run the Google wine club in our Austin office, so I also want to suggest a wine pairing: I’d enjoy this meal with a Viognier or an oaked Fume Blanc. Gather your ingredients: 2 tablespoons Tony Chachere seasoning; 2 tablespoons Kosher salt; 2 tablespoons onion powder; 2 teaspoons dried thyme; 2 teaspoons dried oregano; 2 teaspoons black pepper; 2 teaspoons garlic powder. For the chicken (I usually choose one around four pounds), you’ll need: olive oil; a 12 oz can of dry white wine.Mix all the dry ingredients together. Marinate your chicken in the seasonings 24 hours before grilling. Remember to season the cavity (and wrap in plastic wrap).Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.Rub the chicken and its cavity down with the olive oil. Pour out 1/4 of the wine and sit the chicken on top of the wine can. Place the chicken in the center of the hot grill and cover. Cook the chicken for an hour to an hour and a half, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Once cooked, cover loosely with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.Ancho Chile Skirt Steak TacosSubmitted by Kayla Geier, Senior Communications AssociateMy family's favorite activity is getting together and cooking–whether it's tamales for Christmas or tacos for the Fourth of July. Since my grandfather's passing I've taken the role of grilling, using some of his \"secrets\", along with tricks from a few cookbooks. I find that grilling helps me keep his memory alive.Place steak (recipe calls for 2 lbs) in a large zip-top plastic freezer bag or covered bowl. Stir together the juice of 2 limes, 1 tablespoon cumin, 1 tablespoon ancho chile powder, 1/4 tablespoon onion salt and 2 tablespoons garlic powder. Whisk the above in 1/4 cup olive oil, and pour over flank steak. Seal bag, and turn to coat. Chill 1-12 hours.Grill to your liking–medium is always preferred. Top with slices of cucumber (it'll cool down the heat), your favorite salsa (mine is Tapatio) and fresh guac with the spice of Serrano chiles on a flour tortilla.Uncle Buck’s RibsSubmitted by Susannah Callahan, Product Marketing Manager at Google NestGrowing up in St. Louis, pork baby back ribs were always a favorite, especially around the Fourth of July. My Uncle Buck—not that one, but just as funny—has been perfecting his rib recipe for friends and family since the 1970s. The layers of marinade and sauces make these ribs extra juicy and tender, but also easy enough to tackle for grilling novices. Around 24-48 hours before grill time, place 4-5 lbs (or two full racks) of pork baby back ribs (membrane removed), in the following marinade: 1 cup chicken broth; 1 cup soy sauce; 1 cup brown sugar; 5 tablespoons cider vinegar; 5 tablespoons olive oil; ½ teaspoon garlic powder; ½ teaspoon dehydrated onion; 1 tablespoon of paprika; 1 tablespoon of cornstarch; 3 tablespoons liquid smoke; salt and pepper .30 minutes before grilling, glaze the ribs with Korean BBQ sauce (make sure it has apple and pear puree). This sweet sauce helps to caramelize the ribs when they hit the grill.Heat the grill to 550-600 degrees Fahrenheit and baste each side of the ribs on the grill twice, for two to three minutes. Then, turn the grill down to 300 degrees and repeat the basting process and timing above two more times with the leftover marinade. Lastly, turn the temperature down to 200 degrees and baste each side with your choice of thick honey BBQ sauce three times for three minutes. Serve immediately. Here’s to a happy, safe and delicious holiday!"

            "Dinosaurs may have ruled the Earth millions of years ago, but with augmented reality (AR), you can turn your home into “Jurassic World.” We're partnering with Universal Brand Development, Amblin Entertainment and Ludia to bring 10 dinosaurs from the franchise film, “Jurassic World”, to Google Search. Watch the massive T. Rex stomp in your living room or gaze up at a majestic Brachiosaurus as it towers above a neighborhood tree. Search for a dinosaur on Google using a mobile device and tap “View in 3D” to rotate or zoom in and see it up close. You can then bring the dinosaur into your space with AR and adjust its size to understand how big it is in relation to the things around you. On Android devices, turn up your volume to hear the thudding footsteps and roars of each dinosaur. “Jurassic World” dinosaurs that are viewable in AR include: Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor, Triceratops, Spinosaurus, Stegosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Dilophosaurus, Pteranodon, and Parasaurolophus.",
            "A behind-the-scenes look at how “Jurassic World” AR dinosaurs are made Using technology from Ludia’s “Jurassic World Alive” game, these AR dinosaurs are some of the most realistic models out there. Check out this video to see how an AR Brachiosaurus is made, including 3D modeling, texturing and animation.“To create the 3D dinosaurs, our concept artists first did preliminary research to discover information about each creature,” says Camilo Sanin, Ludia’s Lead on Character Creations. “Not only did we draw research from various forms of literature, our artists also worked with paleontologists and the ‘Jurassic World’ team to make the assets as accurate and realistic as possible. Even the smallest of details, such as irregularities of skin color and patterns, are important.” Unlike some of Google’s AR animals, like a dog or tiger, dinosaurs pose a new technical challenge: their massive size. The new auto-scale feature on Android can now automatically calculate the distance between your phone and a surface in your space and resize the dinosaur so it fits on your phone screen. If you tap “View actual size,” AR tracking technology automatically repositions the dinosaur in your space to make room for it.",
            "How to access and shareOn Android, search for “dinosaur” or one of the 10 dinosaurs on the Google app or any Android browser and tap “View in 3D.” You can see 3D content on devices running with Android 7 and above and you can see AR content on ARCore-enabled devices. Easily explore all dinosaurs using the carousel format. On iOS, search for “dinosaur” or one of the 10 dinosaurs on the Google app or on Google.com with Chrome or Safari. 3D and AR content is available on devices running iOS 11 and above.You can also create AR videos—or recreate your favorite scenes from the “Jurassic World” movies—with the recording option. Don’t forget to tag your photos and videos on social with #Google3D and #JurassicWorld. Safe traveling (back in time)!"

People often have many high quality choices available but aren't always aware of them all or don't have an easy way to access them. For many merchants, connecting with customers in a digital environment is still relatively new territory or a smaller part of their business. However, consumer preference for online shopping has increased dramatically, and it’s crucial that we help people find all the best options available and help merchants more easily connect with consumers online.",
            "Free listings on Google SearchWe recently announced that product results on the Google Shopping tab in the U.S. will consist primarily of free listings. This change has already produced a significant increase in user engagement, with both clicks and impressions up substantially for merchants, meaning consumers are finding more of the products they’re looking for from a wider range of options.

            "People develop loyalty to the brands that make it easy to purchase products and services and connect with their customer support. Google has built digital tools to help brands do this, including the ability to message customers through Google Maps and Search, via Google My Business. Messaging has become such a valuable way to connect with customers that twice as many businesses are messaging via Google now, compared to last year.Today we’re expanding Business Messages in Maps and Search to support all kinds of businesses, and giving them the ability to integrate Business Messages directly with their customer service platforms. Business Messages provides brands a comprehensive messaging solution across Android devices, and through Maps on iOS. To improve connections with customers, we’ve recently introduced new smart replies, visual product carousels, and unique welcome messages. There’s also a smooth transition from automated replies to a customer service agent, so that it's not disruptive when the customer messages a business.Several organizations, including Woolworths, Walmart and MyGov were among the first to try the updated Business Messages experience to make customer care more effective and efficient, particularly during COVID-19. Woolworths, Australia's largest supermarket, allows customers to search for products and see availability and aisle information at their local store, plus get details about hours and COVID-19 related updates to make shopping easier. In just a few messages, Walmart lets customers quickly find up-to-date information about store hours, pick-up and delivery options, precautions and more. And MyGov, with partner Amplify.ai, is providing help and answering live questions from Indian citizens about hours, COVID-19 helplines, and ways to volunteer and donate, for more than 11,000 food and night shelters across India.",
            "A number of brands are using Business Messages to sell products and answer customer questions along the way. Mattress Firm, with messaging partner Podium, is successfully selling mattresses directly through Business Messages by sharing videos and product information, even while stores were closed due to COVID-19. DISH, with partner [24]7.ai, has seen a reduction of more than 22 percent in average handle time using Business Messages features compared to other messaging channels.As brands connect with their customers via Business Messages, we’re experimenting with more ways for them to highlight this communications tool on Search. Business Messages will also be available on mobile websites so that a business can add the ability for customers to quickly “Message” right from their site and offer the same smart automated replies, paired with live agent connection.Business Messages is currently available in English, with expanded coverage to other languages launching soon. Brands and messaging partners can sign up to access the Business Messages API and developer documentation. We also have partners ready to help brands optimize their messaging flow with engaged customers. Businesses can also still manage messaging through Google My Business."

            "My favorite part of summertime is that it means music festival season is upon us. For me, there’s nothing better than getting together with all my friends and listening to our favorite bands on a warm, sunny day. This year, the festivals will have to wait, and while I’ll miss the jam-packed action of a live show, thankfully I have a back up system powered by Spotify, and Nest and Google Home smart speakers and displays.Nest Mini, Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max and Google Home Max, to name a few, all work together to build a sound system that can cover your whole home. Plus, Spotify Premium users can ask Google Assistant to recommend some music and Google Assistant will offer multiple choices from artists and genres that they like, and others like them to choose from.Obviously, I’m not the only one curating my own concerts at home: Here’s a look at how some of you have been listening to Spotify on Nest and Google Home devices.Quarantine streamsSpotify shared how people have been listening to Spotify on Nest and Google Home smart speakers and displays between May 10 and June 10 of this year, in all parts of the world where both Spotify and our devices are available. Suffice it to say that quarantine apparently has many of us in our feelings, with Drake as the top-streamed artist on Nest devices. And given the stress of 2020, it's no surprise the top playlists are all related to sleep and relaxation. In fact, Google Trends backed up Spotify’s data , showing that searches for “insomnia” reached an all-time high in April of this year.",
            "We also took a look at Google Trends to see which of the three top artists are being searched the most by country, which you can see below.",
            "Songs of summer Summer couldn’t come soon enough. According to Google Trends, searches for “summertime songs” spiked more than 1,150 percent and searches for “songs that remind you of summer” spiked more than 1,000 percent in the past 90 days worldwide. Thankfully, Spotify can help listeners land on a summer jam. Spanning a variety of genres—from hip-hop to indie—Spotify’s Songs of Summer predictions are based on a number of factors like streaming numbers, current trajectory and future forecasting from their global curation team. This year, the team at Spotify predicts that “This is America” by Childish Gambino and “Alright” by Kendrick Lamar are likely to be mainstays during summer 2020.  The resurgence of these older tracks is likely due to cultural conversations focused on supporting the Black community. In fact, global Google Trends searches for the meaning of “This is America,” by Childish Gambino spiked more than 700 percent over the past month. In no particular order, here’s Spotify’s playlist of predictions for summer 2020, which you can stream on your Nest device by saying, “Hey Google, play Songs of Summer.” The playlist includes current hits like “ROCKSTAR” by DaBaby, featuring Roddy Ricch and “Watermelon Sugar” by Harry Styles.  Your Summer Rewind playlist from SpotifyThis year, it feels especially important to relive the glory of summers past. To help, Spotify is re-introducing Your Summer Rewind, a personalized collection of your favorite summer jams from previous years. It will be available in all of Spotify’s Northern Hemisphere markets for both Free and Premium listeners on iOS and Android starting today.  Make sure your Spotify account is linked in the Google Home app and say, “Hey Google, play Your Summer Rewind playlist on Spotify” to get started. I’m sure I’m not the only one who will be missing music festivals this year, but Nest and Spotify will certainly help me party at home, and cure some of my quarantine woes this summer."

Starting today, we are surfacing fact check information in Google Images globally to help people navigate these issues and make more informed judgments about what they see on the web. This builds on the fact check features in Search and News, which people come across billions of times per year. Now, when you search on Google Images, you may see a \"Fact Check\" label under the thumbnail image results. When you tap one of these results to view the image in a larger format, you’ll see a summary of the fact check that appears on the underlying web page. These labels may appear both for fact check articles about specific images and for fact check articles that include an image in the story.",

These sources rely on ClaimReview, an open method used by publishers to indicate fact check content to search engines. We already highlight fact checks on Search and in Google News to make this content easy to discover. YouTube also leverages ClaimReview to surface fact check information panels in Brazil, India and the U.S. The full fact check library can be accessed through a dedicated search tool and an open API. Just as is the case in Search, adding this label in Google Images results does not affect ranking; our systems are designed to surface the most relevant, reliable information available, including from sources that provide fact checks.To recognize the important work being done by fact-checkers during the ongoing pandemic, the Google News Initiative provided $6.5 million in funding support to organizations around the globe earlier this year. Taken together, these efforts not only highlight the significant contributions of the fact check community, but they also ensure that people have access to critical context about the information⁠—and now images⁠—they encounter online."

        "Publish Date": "Jun 09, 2020",
        "article_paragraphs": [
            "When you come to Search with a query in mind, you trust that Google will find a number of relevant and helpful pages to choose from. We put a lot of time and effort into improving our search systems to ensure that’s the case.Working on improvements to our language understanding and other search systems is only part of why Google remains so helpful. Equally important is our ability to fight spam. Without our spam-fighting systems and teams, the quality of Search would be reduced--it would be a lot harder to find helpful information you can trust. With low quality pages spamming their way into the top results, the greater the chances that people could get tricked by phony sites trying to steal personal information or infect their computers with malware. If you’ve ever gone into your spam folder in Gmail, that’s akin to what Search results would be like without our spam detection capabilities.Every year we publish a Webspam Report that details the efforts behind reducing spam in your search results and supporting the community of site creators whose websites we help you discover. To coincide with this year’s report, we wanted to give some additional context for why spam-fighting is so important, and how we go about it.Defining “spam”We’ve always designed our systems to prioritize the most relevant and reliable webpages at the top. We publicly describe the factors that go into our ranking systems so that web creators can understand the types of content that our systems will recognize as high quality.We define “spam” as using techniques that attempt to mimic these signals without actually delivering on the promise of a high quality content, or other tactics that might prove harmful to searchers.Our Webmaster Guidelines detail the types of spammy behavior that is discouraged and can lead to a lower ranking: everything from scraping pages and keyword stuffing to participating in link schemes and implementing sneaky redirects. Fighting spam is never-ending battle, a constant game of cat-and-mouse against existing and new spammy behaviors. This threat of spam is why we’ve continued to be very careful about how much detail we reveal about how our systems work. However, we do share a lot, including resources that provide transparency about the positive behaviors creators should follow to create great information and gain visibility and traffic from Search.Spotting the spammersThe first step of fighting spam is detection. So how do we spot it? We employ a combination of manual reviews by our analysts and a variety of automated detection systems.We can’t share the specific techniques we use for spam fighting because that would weaken our protections and ultimately make Search much less useful. But we can share about spammy behavior that can be detected systematically. After all, a low quality page might include the right words and phrases that match what you searched for, so our language systems wouldn’t be able to detect unhelpful pages from content alone. The telltale signs of spam are in the behavioral tactics used and how they try to manipulate our ranking systems against our Webmaster Guidelines. Our spam-fighting systems detect these behaviors so we can tackle this problem at scale. In fact, the scale is huge. Last year, we observed that more than 25 billion of the pages we find each day are spammy. (If each of those pages were a page in a book, that would be more than 20 million copies of “War & Peace” each day!) This leads to an important question: once we find all this spam, what happens next?Stopping the spammersWhen it comes to how we handle spam, it depends on the type of spam and how severe the violation is. For most of the 25 billion spammy pages detected each day, we’re able to automatically recognize their spammy behavior and ensure they don’t rank well in our results. But that’s not the case for everything. As with anything, our automated systems aren’t perfect. That’s why we also supplement them with human review, a team that does its own spam sleuthing to understand if content or sites are violating our guidelines. Often, this human review process leads to better automated systems. We look to understand how that spam got past our systems and then work to improve our detection, so that we catch the particular case and automatically detect many other similar cases overall.In other cases, we may issue what’s called a manual action, when one of our human spam reviewers finds that content that isn’t complying with our Webmaster Guidelines. This can lead to a demotion or a removal of spam content from our search results, especially if it’s deemed to be particularly harmful, like a hacked site that has pages distributing malware to visitors.When a manual action takes place, we send a notice to the site owner via Search Console, which webmasters can see in their Manual Actions Report. We send millions of these notices each year, and it gives site owners the opportunity to fix the issue and submit for reconsideration. After all, not all “spam” is purposeful, so if a site owner has inadvertently tried tactics that run afoul of our guidelines, or if their site has been compromised by hackers, we want to ensure they can make things right and have their useful information again available to people in Search. This brings us back to why we invest so much effort in fighting spam: so that Search can bring you good, helpful and safe content from sites across the web.Discovering great informationIt’s unfortunate that there’s so much spam, and so much effort that has to be spent fighting it. But that shouldn’t overshadow the fact there are millions upon millions of businesses, publishers and websites with great content for people to discover. We want them to succeed, and we provide tools, support and guidance to help.We publish our own Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide to provide tips on how to succeed with appropriate techniques in Search. Our Search Relations team conducts virtual office hours, monitors our Webmaster Community forums, and (when possible!) hosts and participates in events around the world to help site creators improve their presence in Search. We provide a variety of support resources, as well as the Search Console toolset to help creators with search.We’d also encourage anyone to visit our How Google Search Works site, which shares more generally about how our systems work to generate great search results for everyone."

            "Editor’s note: This post is authored by Daniel H. Gillison, Jr., CEO of The National Alliance on Mental Illness.Anxiety disorders affect 48 million adults in the U.S. Anxiety presents itself as a wide range of symptoms, and can be a result of biological factors or triggered by a change in environment or exposure to a stressful event. With COVID-19 introducing new points of stress, communities are seeing a rise in mental health issues and needs. New Census Bureau data released last week shows that a third of Americans are now showing signs of clinical anxiety or depression.The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) is the nation’s largest grassroots mental health organization and we’re partnering with Google to provide access to mental health resources. Starting today when people in the U.S. search on Google for information about anxiety, we’ll provide access to a clinically-validated questionnaire called the GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7). The GAD-7 will show up in the knowledge panel—the box of information that displays key facts when you search for something—and also has medically-validated information about anxiety, including symptoms and common treatments.",
            "This seven-question survey covers many of the same questions a health professional may ask, and your answers are private and secure (Google does not collect or share answers or results from the questionnaire). The GAD-7 helps people understand how their self-reported anxiety symptoms map to anxiety levels of people who completed the same questionnaire. The tool also provides access to resources developed by NAMI so people can learn more and seek help when needed.",
            "The GAD-7 is the third mental health screener available on Google Search. We’ve previously partnered with Google so that people who search for information on depression and PTSD can access relevant clinically-validated questionnaires that provide more information and links to resources about those conditions. The self-assessments are currently available in the U.S., and Google hopes to make them available in additional countries over time.Anxiety can show up as a wide range of physical and emotional symptoms, and it can take decades for people who first experience symptoms to get treatment. By providing access to authoritative information, and the resources and tools to learn more about anxiety, we hope to empower more people to take action and seek help."

            "Running a business requires a whole lot of ingenuity and perseverance. It’s those same qualities that are helping local businesses adapt, and even thrive, in today’s new normal. To adjust, business owners are increasingly turning to digital tools. According to a newly released report by the Connected Commerce Council, nearly one in three small business owners said that without digital tools they would have had to close all or parts of their business.We’ve rolled out new features to help businesses get the support they need, adapt their operations, and quickly update customers about their latest changes.Let people know how they can help We’ve seen firsthand in Google Search and Maps the impact that COVID-19 has had on small businesses and how they connect with their customers. People across the world are looking for ways to continue supporting corner bookstores, local watering holes, beloved dance studios and other businesses that give their neighborhoods character—even if it’s from a distance. To help local businesses share how their communities can support them during COVID-19, we recently began allowing merchants in six countries to add support links for donations and gift cards to their Business Profiles on Google. Starting today, we’re rolling support links out to merchants in an additional 18 countries such as Italy, Spain and Japan. We’ve partnered with PayPal and GoFundMe for donations. For gift cards, merchants can link directly to the relevant page on their website or to their gift card offerings with one of our eligible partners, which includes Square, Toast, Clover and Vagaro.People around the world are looking to help—with global search interest in \"how to help small businesses\" reaching an all-time high in March 2020, increasing more than 700 percent since February. To help connect them with nearby businesses in need, we’ve made it possible for people to look up their favorite local businesses by name to see if they’ve added donation or gift card links to their Business Profile. And in the coming weeks, people will also be able to use Search and Maps to find all of the nearby businesses that are asking for support.",
            "Transition to online services with ease Merchants who normally provided in-person services are now pivoting to connect with their customers virtually—from yoga studios offering online classes to salons hosting virtual hair styling classes. We’re making it easier for customers to discover online classes and book virtual appointments with these new features:Get discovered: Merchants who are verified on Google My Business will soon be able to add attributes like “online classes,” “online appointments,” or “online estimates” to their Business Profiles to let people know how they’re operating. Today merchants can add one of these attributes using Google My Business, and in the coming weeks it’ll be visible on merchants’ Business Profiles in Search and Maps. Online service bookings directly on Google: We’re expanding Reserve with Google to help merchants offer easy appointment bookings for online services so customers can quickly find available times, book a slot, and add it to their Google Calendar—all directly from a merchant’s Business Profile. Millions of people have already booked in-person appointments with salons, restaurants and other businesses thanks to integrations from over 100 Reserve with Google partners. We’re now expanding this to include bookings for online services, starting with partners like Booksy, Regis, WellnessLiving, and Zooty. Merchants working with one of these partners can offer online bookings directly on Google and share details with customers about how to pay and join the meeting using their preferred video platform.",
            "Keep everyone in the know with the latest business informationSometimes it’s not as simple as “open” and “closed.” Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve added new tools to help merchants keep customers informed about how and when they’re operating. Across all business verticals, we launched the ability to mark their business as temporarily closed, as well as reopen when they’re ready to open their doors. We also added secondary hours and COVID-19 posts so merchants can communicate important information about their operations directly in Google Search and Maps. Since March, we’ve seen more than 1 million businesses share COVID-19 posts, with millions of clicks to merchants’ websites every week as consumers look for more information.With many people unable to enjoy meals inside their favorite restaurants, demand for food delivery and takeout has skyrocketed. In response, we’ve added more third-party ordering providers, so people everywhere can order delivery and takeout from an additional 25,000 restaurants directly on Google. To give merchants even more control, we’ll soon be making it easier for food merchants to indicate their preferred online ordering partners on their Business Profiles. Today people are deciding where to grab food not only based on the menu, but also on how easy it is to pick up safely. We added attributes like “curbside pickup,” “no contact delivery,” and “dine-in” so that restaurants could easily share these important details on their Business Profiles in Search and Maps. Since March, more than 3 million restaurants have added or edited their dining attributes. Some restaurateurs are even ditching dining areas for good. To support all types of food merchants, virtual kitchens can now verify their businesses on Google My Business.",
            "We know that every day during this pandemic can be drastically different—and for small business owners, there can be a lot of uncertainty. While we can’t control what each day looks like, our goal is to continue helping businesses communicate the latest with consumers across the world."

            "Sometimes Google Search will show special boxes with information about people, places and things. We call these knowledge panels. They’re designed to help you quickly understand more about a particular subject by surfacing key facts and to make it easier to explore a topic in more depth. Information within knowledge panels comes from our Knowledge Graph, which is like a giant virtual encyclopedia of facts. In this post, we’ll share more about how knowledge panels are automatically generated, how data for the Knowledge Graph is gathered and how we monitor and react to reports of incorrect information.What’s a knowledge panel?Knowledge panels are easily recognized by those who do desktop searching, appearing to the right of search results:",
            "Our systems aim to show the most relevant and popular information for a topic within a knowledge panel. Because no topic is the same, exactly what is shown in a knowledge panel will vary. But typically, they’ll include:Title and short summary of the topicA longer description of the subjectA picture or pictures of the person, place or thingKey facts, such as when a notable figure was born or where something is locatedLinks to social profiles and official websitesKnowledge panels might also include special information related to particular topics. For example:Songs from musical artistsUpcoming episodes from TV showsRosters of sports teams.Sources of information for the Knowledge GraphThe information about an “entity”—a person, place or thing—in our knowledge panels comes from our Knowledge Graph, which was launched in 2012. It’s a system that understands facts and information about entities from materials shared across the web, as well as from open source and licensed databases. It has amassed over 500 billion facts about five billion entities.Wikipedia is a commonly-cited source, but it’s not the only one. We draw from hundreds of sources from across the web, including licensing data that appears in knowledge panels for music, sports and TV. We work with medical providers to create carefully vetted content for knowledge panels for health issues. We also draw from special coding that content owners can use, such as to indicate upcoming events.On mobile, multiple knowledge panels provide factsWhen we first launched knowledge panels, most search activity happened on desktop, where there was room to easily show knowledge panels alongside search results. Today, most search activity happens on mobile, where screen size doesn’t allow for a side-by-side display.To this end, information from the Knowledge Graph is often not presented through a single knowledge panel on mobile. Instead, one or more knowledge panels may appear interspersed among the overall results.",
            "How we work to improve the Knowledge GraphInaccuracies in the Knowledge Graph can occasionally happen. Just as we have automatic systems that gather facts for the Knowledge Graph, we also have automatic systems designed to prevent inaccuracies from appearing. However, as with anything, the systems aren’t perfect. That’s why we also accept reports from anyone about issues.Selecting the “Feedback” link at the bottom of a knowledge panel or the three dots at the top of one on mobile brings up options to provide feedback to us:",
            "We analyze feedback like this to understand how any actual inaccuracies got past our systems, so that we can make improvements generally across the Knowledge Graph overall. We also remove inaccurate facts that come to our attention for violating our policies, especially prioritizing issues relating to public interest topics such as civic, medical, scientific, and historical issues or where there’s a risk of serious and immediate harm.How entities can claim and suggest changes to a knowledge panelMany knowledge panels can be “claimed” by the subject they are about, such as a person or a company. The claiming process—what we call getting verified—allows subjects to provide feedback directly to us about potential changes or to suggest things like a preferred photo. For local businesses, there’s a separate process of claiming that operates through Google My Business. This enables local businesses to manage special elements in their knowledge panels, such as opening hours and contact phone numbers.For more information about topics like this, check out our How Search Works blog series and website."

Her goal was always to give us a better life and unparalleled opportunities to what she had growing up in Mexico—and she regularly worked more than three jobs at a time to do it. The truth is, I have no idea how she pulled it all off. I also don’t know that I’ll ever be able to convey the extent of gratitude I feel for who she is (a supermom!) and what she did for us.

            "Since COVID-19 began, we’ve heard from our retail and brand manufacturing partners that they’re hungry for more insights on how consumer interests are changing, given fluctuations in consumer demand. We see these changes reflected in how people are searching on Google. Last month, there were spikes in search interest for household supplies and jigsaw puzzles as people spent more time at home. This month we’ve seen surging interest for sewing machines and baking materials in the U.S., and tetherball sets and chalk in the United Kingdom and Australia. Businesses are using a variety of resources to understand changing consumer interests—including Google Trends, social listening, surveys, and their own data—in order to help make decisions on the fly. But if they don’t know what to look for, there isn’t an easy way to understand which product categories are gaining in popularity, and might pose an opportunity.That’s why we’re launching a rising retail categories tool on Think with Google. It surfaces fast-growing, product-related categories in Google Search, the locations where they’re growing, and the queries associated with them. This is the first time we’ve provided this type of insight on the product categories that people are searching for.",
            "When we previewed the data with a group of businesses, they had lots of creative ideas for how they might apply it—whether for content creation, promotional efforts, or even new products and services. Here were some of their ideas for how it could help:Content creation: A cookware company noticed that “flour” was a growing category in the United States. The team was inspired to explore partnering with a famous local chef to create engaging content about recipes that incorporate flour. Promotion: A jewelry and accessories company noted rising interest in products in the “free weights” category, so the team thought they might partner with fitness influencers who could help promote their products. Similarly, an online business said it would regularly reference the data to inform which products to feature on its homepage throughout the pandemic. Product ideas: An apparel company with a fast and flexible production model said its team would use this data to inspire new product line ideas.For the next few months, we’ll update the tool with fresh data every day and hope this will help businesses of all sizes find new pockets of consumer interest.

            "For a lot of people, working from home means perfecting their own coffee-making skills rather than popping out to a cafe—and we’re seeing people whip up one style in particular. Dalgona is a delicious, sweet, creamy type of coffee that captured attention after Korean YouTube channel KBS Entertain uploaded a video in January. It took off from there, with fans around the world trying to make the perfect version and urging their friends and family to join in.  A coffee breakout trendIt’s fair to say people were up for the “dalgona challenge”—but first, they needed to figure out how to make it. Search interest in dalgona has never been higher. It started heating up the week of March 15, when searches spiked 1,800 percent around the world. Since then, it’s increased to 3,000 times the usual number of weekly searches.",
            "Brewing up in Southeast Asia (and everywhere) Exactly how popular does that make dalgona? It’s become the most searched type of coffee worldwide in the past 30 days—overcoming legends like the latte, cappuccino, mocha, and the previously undefeated champion, the humble espresso.",
            "People everywhere have tried their hand at dalgona, but they seem a bit more determined to master the art in Southeast Asia: four of the five countries where dalgona coffee was the most searched were in the region.",
            "Spilling the beans on YouTubeA finished dalgona might look like a work of art, but there’s some serious science behind the process. People are turning to YouTube, where it all began, for videos showing how to make the best version. Between March 15 and April 6, average views of videos with “dalgona” in their title on YouTube increased by more than 5,000 percent globally. And it’s not just caffeine-lovers getting involved: people are experimenting with caffeine-free versions using matcha and Milo (chocolate, basically), both of which feature among the most-viewed videos.",
            "It’s been heartwarming to see dalgona coffee bring people together around the world, whether it’s to admire friends’ and strangers’ beautiful creations, or attempt the perfect dalgona themselves. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get back to perfecting my whisk."

            "To prevent the spread of COVID-19, many healthcare providers are reducing or stopping in-person visits for a variety of patient needs, from the treatment of chronic conditions to mental health services to evaluating cough and cold symptoms. Yet, people need a way to continue getting medical care from the comfort and safety of their own homes. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve seen interest in virtual care and telehealth rise dramatically. Health consultations over the phone or by video conference not only help alleviate strain on doctors’ offices and emergency rooms but are also recommended as an important way to protect patients and staff against COVID-19. To help individuals and health care providers connect, we’re focused on providing individuals with access to high-quality and authoritative information and supporting them throughout their health journey. Over the coming week, we’re beginning to roll out two new features in Search and Maps that make it easier for people to connect to virtual healthcare options, whether it’s to a doctor’s office down the street, the hospital across town, or a national telehealth platform.",
            "Local healthcare providers, now virtualHealthcare providers like hospitals, doctors, and mental health professionals can now enter a virtual care offering in their Business Profile, so that people searching for their local provider, for instance, might see a “get online care” link on Search and Maps. Clicking this link will take people to that provider’s virtual care website where they can find more information, and in many cases, schedule a virtual healthcare visit with a provider. The pandemic has affected many healthcare providers’ operating hours and walk-in visit policies. To help communicate changes that might affect someone’s visit, we’re automatically surfacing a link directly to health providers’ COVID-19 information page on Search and Maps, and we've assembled best practices on how healthcare providers can update their websites and provide COVID-19 information on Google My Business.",
            "Find virtual healthcare, anywhere, anytimeBeginning as a pilot in the U.S., we’ll also begin showing widely-available virtual care platforms directly on Search so people can more easily access virtual visits. For example, when people search for “immediate care”, we’ll be able to also present available virtual care options and related information such as the out-of-pocket price charged for a visit (for those without insurance) and an easy way for people to directly connect with the virtual care platform. The visit between the patient and provider will take place on the healthcare provider’s platform of choice.",
            "For healthcare providers, helping you keep up with demandIn addition to helping healthcare providers with information about how to keep their online business information up-to-date, Google Cloud is supporting providers with technology infrastructure and solutions to assist with care delivery and operations. This includes helping doctors support patients remotely with HIPAA-compliant G Suite products (including using Google Meet for telehealth or virtual visits), deploying virtual agents to field questions related to COVID-19, and helping with capacity-planning and demand forecasting of key medical supplies to better manage their supply chains.The global COVID-19 pandemic and the response to prevent its spread has changed the way individuals access and connect to health care. Across our products, we’ll continue to ensure that healthcare providers have the tools to connect with patients, and that anyone can access the information and care they need to stay healthy."

One that stood out during the ninety-minute commute was Planet Money, which became a ritual for me as I studied economics. Since then I've gradually gathered a list of favorites for all activities from long runs to cooking dinner—Acquired, PTI, and More Perfect are a few.

Regardless of the platform you’re using, your listening progress will sync across devices, and you’ll be able to pick up right where you left off.The new app is organized around three tabs: Home, Explore and Activity. The Home tab features a feed of new episodes and gives you quick access to your subscribed shows. When you select an episode you want to listen to, you’ll now see topics or people covered in that podcast, and you can easily jump to Google Search to learn more.",

            "The world of book publishing today is, in many ways, dignified and highbrow. But it was a different story in the 16th century, about a hundred years after the invention of the printing press. Publishing was a high-risk, high-reward proposition: With the right backing and enough capital investment, an entrepreneur could become wildly successful. But publishing the wrong thing in the wrong place could be disastrous—even fatal, with governments and religious authorities taking a very severe view of what content was fit to print.No one knew this better than Christophe Plantin, who set up a publishing house in Antwerp, Belgium, in the mid-16th century. Facing religious intolerance and escaping persecution, he helped put the city on the map as a publishing powerhouse. His own printing operation continued in his family for generations. Today, Plantin’s home and business are preserved as the Plantin-Moretus Museum, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to 25,000 early printed books. Visitors to Antwerp can walk through the rooms where the family lived and worked, and researchers can delve into the collection’s manuscripts, books, archives and original prints.And now, thanks to a partnership between the City of Antwerp and Google, we will digitize more than 32,000 books from the museum, along with an additional 60,000 books held by the city’s Hendrik Conscience Heritage Library.",
            "In total, more than 100,000 international works published from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century will be made freely accessible in the coming years via Google Books and the library catalogues of both institutions. The scanned volumes, which are no longer subject to copyright, will be full-text searchable, meaning that researchers—as well as members of the public—will be able to search them easily and quickly.The digitization will start in early 2021, allowing time for both Google and the city to set up the project and establish logistics processes. We expect it will take at least three years, partly because we don’t want to cause too much disruption to library visitors who come to view the materials. The books will be transported securely in batches from Antwerp to our European digitization center. Shortly after each work is scanned, the digital copy will appear on books.google.com, and the libraries will also receive digital copies of their respective works to incorporate into their own catalogues. Google Books was launched 15 years ago, with the goal of making all books from around the world digitally available and searchable for everyone. This collaboration with the City of Antwerp adds an incredibly rich collection from the Dutch-speaking world to our collection, and brings us a crucial step closer to achieving our mission."

The alert has launched in 25 languages across dozens of countries, and people in more than 50 countries can access localized public health guidance from health authorities. Expanding our COVID-19 Search experienceNow, as we continue to see people’s information needs expanding, we’re introducing a more comprehensive experience for COVID-19 in Search, providing easy access to authoritative information from health authorities alongside new data and visualizations. This new format organizes the search results page to help people easily navigate information and resources, and it will also make it possible to add more information over time as it becomes available.",
            "In addition to links to helpful resources from national and local health authorities, people will also find a carousel of Twitter accounts from local civic organizations and health authorities to help connect them with the latest local guidance as it’s shared. We’ve also introduced a feature to surface some of the most common questions about the pandemic, with relevant snippets sourced from the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). To help people track the latest information about the spread of the disease, we’re adding modules with statistics and a map showing COVID-19 prevalence in countries around the world. This new COVID-19 experience on Search will roll out in the coming days in English in the U.S., and we plan to add more information and expand to other languages and countries soon.A website dedicated to help and resourcesIn addition to launching new features on Google Search that provide easy access to more authoritative information, we’ve worked with relevant agencies and authorities to roll out a website—available at google.com/covid19—focused on education, prevention and local resources. People can find state-based information, safety and prevention tips, search trends related to COVID-19, and further resources for individuals, educators and businesses. Launching today in the U.S., the site will be available in more languages and countries in the coming days and we’ll update the website as more resources become available. Along with our other products and initiatives, we hope these resources will help people find answers to the questions they’re asking and get the help they need.Guidance around local health servicesWe’re also looking for more ways we can help people follow authoritative public health guidance and locate appropriate health services through our products. Right now in the U.S., people seeking out urgent care, hospitals and other medical services in Search or Maps will see an alert reminding them of the CDC’s recommendation that symptomatic individuals call ahead in order to avoid overwhelming health systems and increasing the risk of exposure.",
            "As coronavirus becomes a challenge in more communities and as authorities around the world develop new guidance and tools to address the pandemic, we’ll continue to find more opportunities to connect people with key information to keep themselves, their families, and their communities safe."

            "Ten years ago Google aired its first-ever commercial, during the 2010 Super Bowl. We’ve run several more Super Bowl ads in the years since. And on Sunday, viewers of this year’s game will see “Loretta,” which tells the story of a man who uses the Google Assistant to keep the memory of his love alive. The ad reflects our goal to build products that help people in their daily lives, in both big and small ways. Sometimes that’s finding a location, sometimes it’s playing a favorite movie, and sometimes it’s using the Google Assistant to remember meaningful details. “Loretta” has a few other things in common with our “Parisian Love” commercial from 10 years ago. Both are simple love stories told through the lens of our products. Both were inspired by real people—in fact, the voice you hear throughout “Loretta” is the grandfather of a Googler, whose story we drew from to create the ad. At 85, to an audience of millions, he’ll be making his film debut. We couldn’t be happier for him.As we look forward to this weekend's game, we’re also releasing “A little help before the Super Bowl,” which celebrates the questions people ask about the game every year, based on Google Trends data. The teams, cities and performers of the Super Bowl change from year to year, but searches about the game remain consistent. Here’s a look at what people are turning to Search to find out about the big day.",

            "Search trends can help us understand what people are interested in and what has endured—the people and events that have captivated our attention over time. Last year, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day approached, our team had a hunch that his monumental “I Have A Dream Speech” might be the most searched speech in the United States in Google Trends history. It prompted us to analyze 15 years’ worth of U.S. search trends data to find out.Sure enough, it was. This revelation was an electrifying moment for our team. It pushed us to explore more aggregate Search trends data to identify other Black icons, events and movements that were the most searched within a specific category or field in the U.S. Here’s what we found: Dozens of Black Americans and the historical movements they led were searched more than any other person or event in a category. These range from historical milestones like the Montgomery bus boycott to iconic figures like Maya Angelou to the most searched Pulitzer Prize winner—Kendrick Lamar, for his album DAMN.That’s why, in celebration of Black History Month, we’re releasing a film tribute to these iconic moments, online and as an ad during the 2020 Grammy Awards. “Most Searched” tells a powerful story about how the Black community has helped shape and influence American culture. It also shows the tremendous collective interest in our history.We're proud to celebrate the people and events in this film, and also hope that it inspires future history makers. In an effort to help build the next generation of Black leaders, scholars, artists and technologists, we’re awarding a $3 million Google.org grant to support the NAACP's Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics (ACT-SO) program. As part of this, we're connecting Googlers to ACT-SO volunteering opportunities. ACT-SO provides a platform for Black high school students—more than 300,000 to date—to bring their ideas to life and kickstart their journeys to becoming leaders in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), humanities, business, and the arts. This initiative joins previous commitments to support organizations and programs that help Black and Latino students develop the technical skills they need to succeed in career and life.To learn more about these individuals and our celebration of Black History Month, visit g.co/blackhistorymonth."

            "At the Grammy Awards twenty years ago, Jennifer Lopez wore a Versace dress on the red carpet which had a ripple effect on fashion -- not to mention, Google -- for years to come. Jennifer’s dress was so popular on Search that it helped inspire the creation of Google Images (then known as Image Search). In honor of this anniversary, we looked at U.S. fashion trends on Search since Google Trends began in 2004 to see how people have used Google over the years for inspiration and style advice.Jennifer Lopez’s 2000 Grammy Awards appearance may have been the biggest red carpet moment in the show’s history (according to Google Trends), but she wasn’t the only one to make a splash at the event because of what she wore. In the Fashion & Style category, these icons saw spikes when they stepped onto the Grammy Awards red carpet over the years:Jennifer LopezJoy VillaWhoopi GoldbergTeri HatcherGwyneth PaltrowFergieBeyonceQueen LatifahKate WinsletGiuliana RancicBeyond the red carpet, people have turned to Google to learn more about fashionable celebrities since it was possible to do so.

            "Across the web, there are millions of datasets about nearly any subject that interests you. If you’re looking to buy a puppy, you could find datasets compiling complaints of puppy buyers or studies on puppy cognition. Or if you like skiing, you could find data on revenue of ski resorts or injury rates and participation numbers. Dataset Search has indexed almost 25 million of these datasets, giving you a single place to search for datasets and find links to where the data is. Over the past year, people have tried it out and provided feedback, and now Dataset Search is officially out of beta.",
            "What's new in Dataset Search?Based on what we’ve learned from the early adopters of Dataset Search, we’ve added new features. You can now filter the results based on the types of dataset that you want (e.g., tables, images, text), or whether the dataset is available for free from the provider. If a dataset is about a geographic area, you can see the map. Plus, the product is now available on mobile and we’ve significantly improved the quality of dataset descriptions. One thing hasn't changed however: anybody who publishes data can make their datasets discoverable in Dataset Search by using an open standard (schema.org) to describe the properties of their dataset on their own web page.We have also learned how many different types of people look for data. There are academic researchers, finding data to develop their hypotheses (e.g., try oxytocin), students looking for free data in a tabular format, covering the topic of their senior thesis (e.g., try incarceration rates with the corresponding filters), business analysts and data scientists looking for information on mobile apps or fast food establishments, and so on. There is data on all of that! And what do our users ask? The most common queries include \"education,\" \"weather,\" \"cancer,\" \"crime,\" \"soccer,\" and, yes, \"dogs\".",
            "What datasets can you find in Dataset Search?Dataset Search also gives us a snapshot of the data out there on the Web. Here are a few highlights. The largest topics that the datasets cover are geosciences, biology, and agriculture. The majority of governments in the world publish their data and describe it with schema.org. The United States leads in the number of open government datasets available, with more than 2 million. And the most popular data formats? Tables–you can find more than 6 million of them on Dataset Search.The number of datasets that you can find in Dataset Search continues to grow. If you have a dataset on your site and you describe it using schema.org, an open standard, others can find it in Dataset Search. If you know that a dataset exists, but you can't find it in Dataset Search, ask the provider to add the schema.org descriptions and others will be able to learn about their dataset as well.",
            "What's next?Dataset Search is out of beta, but we will continue to improve the product, whether or not it has the \"beta\" next to it. If you haven't already, take Dataset Search for a spin, and tell us what you think."

Sometimes when you find something on Search, you’re not quite ready to take the next step, like cooking a meal or making a purchase. And if you’re like me, you might not save every page you want to revisit later. Today, we’re launching some changes to Collections in Search to make it easier to jump back into your task without digging through your search history. Last year, we created activity cards in Search to make your search history more useful, and to help you pick up where you left off. Using AI, Collections in the Google app and mobile web now groups similar pages you've visited from Search related to activities like cooking, shopping and hobbies. You can choose to save these suggested collections so you can come back to them later. These suggestions can be accessed any time from the Collections tab in the Google app (new on Android!), or through the Google.com side menu on the mobile web. And if you don't want Google to suggest collections for you, you can control this in your settings, which you can visit right from Collections in the Google app.",

Based on what you’ve saved, you’ll see related content behind the “Find More” button within a collection.There’s also a new collaboration feature that lets you share and work on a collection with others. For example, if you’re planning a party with friends, you might want to share the recipes you’re considering, or the decorations you want to use so you can make a decision together. When sharing a collection, you'll have the option to let others view it or to let others make changes. And you can always make it private again if you don't want to share it anymore. The ability to share or collaborate on a collection is rolling out now globally; the ability to see related content will launch in the coming weeks. Suggested collections will start to appear for U.S. English users this week. We’ll look to bring these features to more languages and regions over time.",

Just as we don't charge sites to be part of the Google Search index, participating retailers appear in this new feature for free. Retailers can learn more about what types of products are eligible to appear in this shopping experience on Search.We’re excited to take this step toward making it easier for people to find products they need on Search, and to connect people with great retailers across the web.

Fact checks from authoritative sources are highlighted on Google Search and are labeled in Google News.This is possible because fact-checking initiatives around the world mark up their work with ClaimReview, which allows fact-checkers to signal—and anyone online to automatically detect—that a webpage contains a fact check.",
            "Today we’re sharing that these fact checks appear more than 11 million times a day in Search results globally and in Google News in five countries (Brazil, France, India, U.K. and U.S.). That adds up to roughly 4 billion impressions a year. This library of over 40,000 fact checks is publicly available for anyone to consult through a dedicated search tool and for researchers to access through an open API. We’re also working with the Duke Reporters’ Lab and the International Fact-Checking Network around the adoption of structured data fields for fact checks about multimedia. (Disclosure: I was the founding director of the International Fact-Checking Network.) The information generated by these efforts might provide valuable context for people as they use Google products—for instance, we could surface the origin of a miscaptioned image or background on the creator of a manipulated video. In 2020, we’ll continue our work to provide users with useful context about the content they access online and offline.Beyond highlighting fact checks on our surfaces, Google has for years supported fact-checking projects around the world. In 2020, we’ll explore new models to support the long-term sustainability of the fact-checking field. Fact-checking matters, to Google and everyone who uses our products. We’ll continue to find ways to surface and support quality journalism on our products and beyond."

            "People come to Search for all types of information to help them form a better understanding of the world and the topics they care about most. We’ve continued to bring new improvements to Search to help people better orient themselves around a topic and easily explore related ideas, so they can more quickly go from having a question in mind to developing deeper understanding. Now, we’re using the latest in machine learning to bring this approach to top stories in Google Search, making it easier for people to dive into the most useful, timely articles available.When you’re searching for information on a timely topic--a recent sports upset or the latest scientific breakthrough--you see a carousel of articles at the top of your Search results highlighting relevant news. Now, when there are multiple stories related to your search, we’ll also organize the results by story so it’s easier to understand what’s most relevant and you can make a more informed decision on which specific articles to explore. Within each story, the new structure will make more room for high-quality content--beyond just the most recent coverage--as well as more diverse sources, to bring more context and perspective to the day’s news.For example, if you search for “NASA news,” you might see results grouped under the distinct news stories “NASA adds five companies to moon bid” and “NASA detects water vapor on Jupiter’s moon Europa,” along with additional results under “Also in the news.”",
            "To power this new experience, we developed a new story-understanding technology to map the people, places and things involved in a news story, and then draw connections between them. This technology allows us to create distinct groups of news articles. To generate these groups, we use a variety of machine learning techniques including BERT models to examine the related articles and determine where one story ends and another begins. Our research has shown that clustering results into clearly-defined stories is critical in helping people easily navigate the results and identify the best content for their needs.We’re now also featuring key information, such as notable quotes and related opinion pieces, in the top stories carousel within Search. These different content types provide people a more well-rounded view of a news story to help them decide which angle to explore more deeply. This change is part of a longer-term effort to expand the types of journalistic contributions we highlight to users in Search.",
            "These updates are available starting today on mobile devices, beginning with people using English in the U.S. and rolling out to more languages and locations in the coming months. We hope these updates help people engage with the most relevant information and build a deeper understanding of the world around them."

She joined the cast of “Toy Story 4” as Bitey White, a friendly, hilarious toy tiger. Lebron James became a free agent in 2010 and announced on live television he would sign with the Miami Heat.

This year, he joined the cast of superheroes in “Avengers: Endgame,” which was the top trending movie globally.“The Walking Dead” walked into the top trending TV shows list in 2010 with its  series premiere.

When newspapers first came online, their early sites were hard to navigate and search, didn’t link stories together and often published stories on the web after they went to print. Audio is similar today. It’s an evocative, powerful, massively popular and convenient medium—but because the digital experience has lagged, it’s difficult to find things, especially timely, relevant stories that are meaningful to you.",

            "People around the world come to Search to ask questions related to language, like looking up the definition of a word or double checking the pronunciation of a word in another language. Just this morning I’ve already searched how to define “otorhinolaryngologist” and the translation of “naranja” in Spanish to English.Now, we’re helping people pronounce tricky words and understand the meaning of those words. First, we’re launching a new experimental pronunciation feature that lets you practice word pronunciations right in Search. For the visual learners out there, we’re adding images to our English dictionary and translation features to help you better understand the meaning of a word.Pronunciation practice makes perfectStudies have shown that practicing how to say a word can be helpful for remembering it, especially when you’re learning a new language. Previously, when you searched for things like “how to pronounce quokka,” you could play audio and hear the word. With the new pronunciation feature, you’ll be able to also practice saying “quokka” into your phone’s microphone and receive feedback on what, if anything, can be adjusted in your pronunciation. This feature is rolling out to American English today, with Spanish soon to follow.",
            "To do this, speech recognition technology processes spoken words by separating them into individual soundbites. Using machine learning, it then cross references your pronunciation with the pronunciation it expects. For example, if you’re practicing how to say “asterisk,” the speech recognition technology analyzes how you said the word and then, it recognizes that the last soundbite was pronounced “rict” instead of “uhsk.” Based on this, you will receive feedback on how you can improve next time. Visuals help explain a word’s meaning Visuals are a helpful way to explain what a word means or even improve the retention rate. Starting rolling out today, when you look up the translation of a word or its definition, you’ll start seeing images that give you additional context. This can be useful with words that have multiple meanings like “seal,” or words like “avocado” that aren’t commonly used in all languages or regions. Since not all words are easily described with an image, we’re starting with nouns and plan to expand from there. Images in the dictionary features will be available in English today and across all language translations.",
            "Advances in speech recognition and machine learning can improve the way we learn about languages. We hope these new features give you a creative, more effective way to practice, visualize and remember new words.

Today I’ve already used Search to check this Sunday’s Giants’ score against the Jets, look up lyrics to Coldplay’s new song, and find out when daylight savings starts next year. But with so much information online today, the fastest way to find exactly what you’re looking for isn’t always obvious. In my 14 years at Google as a research scientist for Search, I’ve conducted several studies to understand how people collect, organize and understand large amounts of information when they search the web. I also teach online and in-person classes to equip people with useful techniques for navigating Search. And because I think it’s so important, I even wrote a book: “The Joy of Search: A Google Insider’s Guide to Going beyond the Basics.”There are six simple steps that I teach my students—people of all ages—to help them quickly find the information they are searching for.",

Conducting two or three searches offers a number of perspectives and credible sources for a well-rounded view on the subject.",
            "Check the credibility of your sourcesWhen you search on the web, make sure that the site you land on is the best source of information for what you're looking for. Consider the primary purpose of the website and ask yourself: What are they trying to help me with? What is their goal in providing this information? Does the information on the website align with other credible sources? Another way to check the credibility of a website is to look at online forums or discussion boards to see what other people are saying about the website.",
            "Don’t include the answer in your questionYou might search for something when you already suspect the answer. But including that answer in the query may sway the search results toward what you think the answer is. For example, if you search for “do golden retrievers weigh 85 pounds,” you may find “85 pounds” baked into the webpages that result from your search. Instead search “weight of golden retrievers.” This will show you a variety of results. From there, you can narrow down the correct answer by applying the credible source technique above.",
            "Start your search broadly, then narrow it downBegin searching with broad and fairly general terms about your topic. Then you can narrow your search once you find the most relevant aspects of your search. For instance, if you search for “how many teachers are in NYC” you’ll get a lot of results, but they may not be quite what you’re looking for. Then, try narrowing down your search by being more specific. Instead look for “number of kindergarten teachers in Brooklyn public schools.”",
            "Mix and match your key phrases Sometimes you have to try a couple of different query phrases to focus in on the information you want. Keywords are the most important words in your idea or question—they tell the search engine what you’re seeking. Ask yourself what words will appear on the page that would have the perfect answer, or how someone else would write it. A helpful way to do this is by “parallel browsing” to find a range of information that help you get to the answer. That is, try different variations on your search in different browser tabs and compare the results side-by-side.",
            "Explore other kinds of searchable content (Images, Videos, Books)It can be useful to use Search’s other features, beyond just web search, especially when you want to find content that’s inherently visual. Suppose you want to find an example of how to lay out a resume to find a new job; you may want to explore Google Images for example resumes and web pages with useful job search information. Or, if you want to learn how to cook scallops like your favorite famous chef, you can search through Videos for step-by-step instructional content. Or, say you can’t remember what page a quote is on inside your favorite book. Google Books lets you search for key phrases or excerpts within books, down to the page and paragraph. Use double quotes around your phrase inside of Google Books to find where it’s located within the text. Using these tips, hopefully you'll shave some time off your next search."

This four-week phase of facial fuzz is also known as Movember.We peeked at Google Images trends to see what types of cheek chops and mouth manes are capturing imaginations this year. Spoiler: there’s no wrong way to style your stubble.The superior ‘stacheFew things are as dignifying as a masterful mustache. This year, gentlemen are gravitating toward the traditionally bushier upper lip adornments, and maintenance is top of mind. Search interest in cowboy and cop mustache styles--and mustache wax to keep them tidy--is up more than 5,000 percent since last year.Other ‘stache styles catching attention include the ultra-thin pencil mustache, which has seen more than a 5,000 percent growth in search interest, and the horseshoe mustache at 350 percent growth, for those who prefer their whiskers extend to their chin. The most inspirational mustache-havers this year are NFL players Gardner Minshew and Aaron Rodgers whose lip decor saw more than a 5,000 percent increase in search interest in the past 12 months.Boss beards When it comes to beards and other facial hair options, it’s a story in contrasts, with both super-groomed looks as well as longer, more exuberant styles on the rise. Search interest in the ultra-clean faded and square beard styles has doubled. The more prominent, historically-inspired Viking beard and mustache-plus-goatee Van Dyck look have also seen big leaps in the past year. But not everything is new—retro sideburns and the trusty soul patch have seen 190 percent and 110 percent more search interest on Google Images this year, respectively.Facial fuzz in the US of A Men nationwide are responding to the facial hair furor with a flurry of creativity. We looked at Google Search trends to see which beard, mustache and stubble styles were uniquely popular in each U.S. state, and it’s a wonder to behold. The handlebar mustache reigns supreme in six states across the country, and the goatee remains king in four. Here are a few others to call out (and if you wanted to see what all these styles look like, we have a solution for that….):Arizona: Circle beard (mustache plus rounded goatee combo)Colorado: Braided beard (one braids or two, it’s all up to you)Delaware: Chinstrap beard (a razor-thin beard that follows the jawline)Idaho: Monkey tail beard (asymmetrically shaved to look like a curling “tail”)New Jersey: Huge beard (as opposed to tiny)South Dakota: Glitter beard (start with gel, add glitter, and voila! A bedazzled beak)Virginia: Beard dreads (not just for the top of your head anymore)Washington, D.C.: Chevron mustache (the bushy-yet-perfectly-shaped classic)Washington: 70’s mustache (isn’t this redundant?)Note: All Google Images data pulled from “Beauty & Fitness” category of Google Trends."

            "Editor’s Note: Luvvie Ajayi is the host of the podcasts Rants & Randomness and Jesus & Jollof and the author of the New York Times best-seller I’M JUDGING YOU: The Do-Better Manual.So many people are talking about podcasting these days. Maybe you’ve been thinking of starting a podcast of your own, but you aren’t sure where to start. If so, I’m here to offer help. I’ve partnered with Google Podcasts and PRX on a free Podcasting 101 video series that launches today. Over the course of ten short episodes, my co-host Sean Rameswaram, host of Vox’s Today, Explained, and I walk you through all of the things you need to know to get your podcast started. Additionally, each video is subtitled in five languages (Spanish, Portuguese, French, Hindi and Arabic).I’m eager to share all the lessons I’ve learned since I launched two (yes, two!) podcasts in 2018. For me, podcasts are a new and intimate way to connect with my audience and tell the story of the world as I see it. I talk more about that in the very first episode of the series. Take a listen!",
            "OK, so you should really watch the videos to get all the good stuff, but here are some of my top tips to get you started: 1. Define your who. When you’ve figured out your “why” for making your podcast, then you need to figure out “who” should listen. A focus statement like this can really help: My show is about _________And on it you’ll hear _________And you should listen if you are _________.2. Structure matters. Once you define who you are making your show for, you need to think about the format of your show. Surprisingly, figuring out a structure is something that can give you more flexibility. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel each time. For example, on Rants & Randomness I have four regular segments: the Feel Good, the Rant, the Spotlight, and the Interview. I’m open to changing those segments, like when I have a really great guest and want to break out a separate episode just for them, but my listeners always know what to expect. 3. Prepare for interviews. If you’re going to have a guest on your show, it’s your job to learn everything possible about them before you start interviewing. You want to have a plan for where you want the interview to go. And you definitely want to avoid asking the same questions that everybody else does. But also don’t be afraid to go off-script. Following your guest and your own curiosity is often how you get the good stuff. 4. Write the way you talk. If you want your listeners to connect with you, you need to sound like yourself.  A good way to practice is to record yourself telling a friend your story. Listen back to the recording, and notice how you sound when you’re just naturally saying something. 5. Connect with people. The challenge once you’ve made your show is reaching your listeners. With so many podcasts out there, you need to create ways for people to find you and to engage with your community. For example, I created my LuvvNation social network as a safe place for my community to show up and be themselves. I approach that network, and all of my social media channels, as a place to engage with my audience, not just blast out news of my work.So, what are you waiting for? Binge the entire Podcasting 101 video series (all episodes are less than five minutes). Then go make your podcast, and tell me all about it with the hashtag #podcreator."

We see billions of searches every day, and 15 percent of those queries are ones we haven’t seen before--so we’ve built ways to return results for queries we can’t anticipate.When people like you or I come to Search, we aren’t always quite sure about the best way to formulate a query. We might not know the right words to use, or how to spell something, because often times, we come to Search looking to learn--we don’t necessarily have the knowledge to begin with. At its core, Search is about understanding language. It’s our job to figure out what you’re searching for and surface helpful information from the web, no matter how you spell or combine the words in your query. While we’ve continued to improve our language understanding capabilities over the years, we sometimes still don’t quite get it right, particularly with complex or conversational queries. In fact, that’s one of the reasons why people often use “keyword-ese,” typing strings of words that they think we’ll understand, but aren’t actually how they’d naturally ask a question. With the latest advancements from our research team in the science of language understanding--made possible by machine learning--we’re making a significant improvement to how we understand queries, representing the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search. Applying BERT models to SearchLast year, we introduced and open-sourced a neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or as we call it--BERT, for short. This technology enables anyone to train their own state-of-the-art question answering system. This breakthrough was the result of Google research on transformers: models that process words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order. BERT models can therefore consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it—particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries.But it’s not just advancements in software that can make this possible: we needed new hardware too. Some of the models we can build with BERT are so complex that they push the limits of what we can do using traditional hardware, so for the first time we’re using the latest Cloud TPUs to serve search results and get you more relevant information quickly. Cracking your queriesSo that’s a lot of technical details, but what does it all mean for you? Well, by applying BERT models to both ranking and featured snippets in Search, we’re able to do a much better job  helping you find useful information. In fact, when it comes to ranking results, BERT will help Search better understand one in 10 searches in the U.S. in English, and we’ll bring this to more languages and locales over time.Particularly for longer, more conversational queries, or searches where prepositions like “for” and “to” matter a lot to the meaning, Search will be able to understand the context of the words in your query. You can search in a way that feels natural for you.To launch these improvements, we did a lot of testing to ensure that the changes actually are more helpful. Here are some of the examples that showed up our evaluation process that demonstrate BERT’s ability to understand the intent behind your search.Here’s a search for “2019 brazil traveler to usa need a visa.” The word “to” and its relationship to the other words in the query are particularly important to understanding the meaning. It’s about a Brazilian traveling to the U.S., and not the other way around. Previously, our algorithms wouldn't understand the importance of this connection, and we returned results about U.S. citizens traveling to Brazil. With BERT, Search is able to grasp this nuance and know that the very common word “to” actually matters a lot here, and we can provide a much more relevant result for this query.",
            "Let’s look at another query: “do estheticians stand a lot at work.” Previously, our systems were taking an approach of matching keywords, matching the term “stand-alone” in the result with the word “stand” in the query. But that isn’t the right use of the word “stand” in context. Our BERT models, on the other hand, understand that “stand” is related to the concept of the physical demands of a job, and displays a more useful response.",
            "Here are some other examples where BERT has helped us grasp the subtle nuances of language that computers don’t quite understand the way humans do.",
            "Improving Search in more languagesWe’re also applying BERT to make Search better for people across the world. A powerful characteristic of these systems is that they can take learnings from one language and apply them to others. So we can take models that learn from improvements in English (a language where the vast majority of web content exists) and apply them to other languages. This helps us better return relevant results in the many languages that Search is offered in.For featured snippets, we’re using a BERT model to improve featured snippets in the two dozen countries where this feature is available, and seeing significant improvements in languages like Korean, Hindi and Portuguese.Search is not a solved problemNo matter what you’re looking for, or what language you speak, we hope you’re able to let go of some of your keyword-ese and search in a way that feels natural for you. But you’ll still stump Google from time to time. Even with BERT, we don’t always get it right. If you search for “what state is south of Nebraska,” BERT’s best guess is a community called “South Nebraska.” (If you've got a feeling it's not in Kansas, you're right.)Language understanding remains an ongoing challenge, and it keeps us motivated to continue to improve Search. We’re always getting better and working to find the meaning in-- and most helpful information for-- every query you send our way."

            "Mimi Lozano says genealogy has been a way to dispel the many stereotypes and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic and Latino families. Photo provided by the author.\n\nWhen 85-year-old Mimi Lozano began looking into her Mexican heritage in the 1980s, she had a hard time accessing any information about her ancestors. It turns out the same was true for other people with her background, so she and other local genealogists took action. They decided to start the Society of Hispanic Historical and Ancestral Research, which has been helping people find their roots for over 30 years. Mimi, who recently retired as head of the organization, has seen how technology has made genealogy research easier, particularly for Latino and Hispanic genealogists. \"That's what I tell people. Don't get frustrated,” she says. “If you Google it, someone will have some information.\"But Mimi isn’t alone in her search. Around the country, Hispanic and Latino genealogy enthusiasts are using Google technology to help them track down records, connect with other researchers and even reunite with long-lost relatives, to piece together a richer picture of the past.",
            "Growing up, Lenny Trujillo only knew bits and pieces of his family history. As a young boy, his father would take him to the Agua Mansa Cemetery in Colton, California, where dozens of his relatives are buried. After retiring from the U.S. Postal Service, Lenny, who is 67, wanted to learn more about the patriarch of his family, Lorenzo Trujillo. In 1841, Lorenzo brought his entire family over from New Mexico to modern-day California, becoming one of the early non-indigenous settlers of the San Bernardino and Riverside areas.Using Search, Lenny could look at the burial records of all the Trujillos at the cemetery and research the Old Spanish Trail, which his great-great-great grandfather Lorenzo traversed with his family over a thousand miles by foot. Lorenzo's journey made a deep impression on Lenny. He wanted to memorialize Lorenzo in a significant way, so he enlisted a sculptor and chose one of his artworks to place near the unmarked gravesite. The design, he says, reminds him of a hurricane. “The center is bringing force in but it's also distributing everything at the same time,\" he says.",
            "For 42-year-old Joana Diaz of Philadelphia, genealogy became a way to feel proud of who she is. Growing up, she would spend most summers in Puerto Rico, staying intermittently with both sets of grandparents, then back home, where she had very little family. So she started to look into her genealogy to feel closer to her family back in Puerto Rico. Using Search, she found an old census and history books about Puerto Rico. She learned more about the line of family who came to Puerto Rico from Corsica, deciphering these documents with the help of Google Translate. One of her favorite finds was an old photograph of the church in Cidra, Puerto Rico, where she spent a number of summers. \"It's important to remember the struggles before you and what our ancestors went through,” she says. “On the island, time moves slowly. But it's also where people are still very connected to the earth, to the culture and who they are.\"",

Photo by Sabi Rivera.\n\nLike Lenny, Kat Romero, 37, of Norman, Oklahoma, wanted to learn more about her Hispanic-New Mexican lineage. As a child, Kat mostly grew up with her mother's side of the family. But she longed to know more about her father's family.She found a book, made available on Google Books, that showed that her father’s maternal side was from a long line of prominent Hispanic families. The platform, she says, has been valuable. \"You would have to read countless books that would be in academic libraries just to find a mention of your ancestor,\" she says.She went on to look into her father’s paternal line. Then, she heard that one of her relatives had many of the family keepsakes. The only problem: Due to a family rift, no one knew her whereabouts.  She did some research in Google Search, then called each phone number and wrote letters to each address she found. When she had a good feeling about one of the addresses, she went to investigate. Her hunch was right, and her long-lost cousin greeted her warmly, bringing out bins of photos and family memorabilia. Kat inherited her great grandmother’s tobacco box, hair comb and rosary—things she now treasures.",

Gabriel came to Miami when he was 4 years old.

In his family, he's gained the nickname el investigador because of his relentlessness. He interviewed all the relatives he could find. Through Search, he found some key information about his great-great grandfather, who migrated from the Canary Islands to Cuba: an article that listed the date he became a Cuban citizen. With additional digging, he found an image in a digitized book that showed his great-great grandfather in his tobacco field.  His research led him to meet with relatives he never knew existed.

            "Google Search was built to provide everyone access to information on the web—and with tens of thousands of web pages, hundreds of hours of video, thousands of tweets and news stories published every minute of the day, our job is to sift through that content and find the most helpful results possible. With news in particular, we always aim to show a diversity of articles and sources to give users as much context and insight as possible.   An important element of the coverage we want to provide is original reporting, an endeavor which requires significant time, effort and resources by the publisher. Some stories can also be both critically important in the impact they can have on our world and difficult to put together, requiring reporters to engage in deep investigative pursuits to dig up facts and sources.  These are among the reasons why we aim to support these industry efforts and help people get access to the most authoritative reporting.Recently, we’ve made ranking updates and published changes to our search rater guidelines to help us better recognize original reporting, surface it more prominently in Search and ensure it stays there longer. This means readers interested in the latest news can find the story that started it all, and publishers can benefit from having their original reporting more widely seen.",
            "Ranking changes to support original reporting In today’s fast-paced world of news, the original reporting on a subject doesn’t always stay in the spotlight for long. Many news articles, investigations, exclusive interviews or other work can be so notable that they generate interest and follow-up coverage from other publications. And in other cases, many stories cover a single news development, with all of them published around the same time. This can make it difficult for users to find the story that kicked everything off.While we typically show the latest and most comprehensive version of a story in news results, we've made changes to our products globally to highlight articles that we identify as significant original reporting. Such articles may stay in a highly visible position longer. This prominence allows users to view the original reporting while also looking at more recent articles alongside it.There is no absolute definition of original reporting, nor is there an absolute standard for establishing how original a given article is. It can mean different things to different newsrooms and publishers at different times, so our efforts will constantly evolve as we work to understand the life cycle of a story.",
            "Changing our rater guidelinesWe use algorithms to sort through everything we find on the web and organize this content in a way that is helpful. Those algorithms are composed of hundreds of different signals that are constantly updated and improved. To tune and validate our algorithms and help our systems understand the authoritativeness of individual pages, we have more than 10,000 raters around the world evaluating our work - their feedback doesn't change the ranking of the specific results they're reviewing; instead it is used to evaluate and improve algorithms in a way that applies to all results. The principles that guide how they operate are mapped out in our search rater guidelines, a public document that allows raters to better understand and assess the unique characteristics of content that appears in Search results. In short: these guidelines are the clear description of what we value in content when ranking.  And we’ve just introduced a change to help us gather new feedback so that our automated ranking systems can better surface original content. To illustrate the update, in section 5.1 of the guidelines, we instruct raters to use the highest rating, “very high quality,” for original news reporting “that provides information that would not otherwise have been known had the article not revealed it. Original, in-depth, and investigative reporting requires a high degree of skill, time, and effort.”In addition to recognizing individual instances of original reporting at the page level, we also ask raters to consider the publisher’s overall reputation for original reporting. That update in section 2.6.1 reads: “Many other kinds of websites have reputations as well. For example, you might find that a newspaper (with an associated website) has won journalistic awards. Prestigious awards, such as the Pulitzer Prize award, or a history of high quality original reporting are strong evidence of positive reputation.”We hope these updates to elevate original reporting will provide people with a deeper understanding of their changing communities and the conversations going on around them. Giving everyone better access to original journalism across all types of stories—ranging from movies, sports, music and celebrity scoops to the serious journalism behind #MeToo, the Panama Papers and the opioid crisis—is all about helping people stay informed about the news that matters to them."

            "Pathways is part of our Grow with Google initiative to bring economic opportunity to all Americans. For job seekers looking to acquire new skills or pivot to a new career, information about relevant training programs can be difficult to find. This new feature in Search is designed to help people across America develop new skills and find local programs that prepare them for in-demand jobs in their communities. In the early stages, we worked with partners like the State of Virginia, the Virginia Community College System, and local employers to pilot Pathways. Here’s more about how the feature works in two communities in Virginia, and new ways for training programs to get involved when Pathways becomes available more broadly. Pathways in VirginiaNow in Hampton Roads and Richmond, Virginia, when people search for things like “ jobs near me” or “job training” on Google, they’re able to find jobs that are in demand in their area and discover local training programs to prepare them for those jobs. They can then easily compare program costs and outcomes and learn how to enroll.",
            "The Pathways pilot feature includes information about training programs across industries like healthcare, information technology and machining. And you can find out about occupations like nursing, medical technicians, software developers, and welding. We’re focusing on programs that can help people develop marketable skills and get into the workforce: these are full-time degree or certificate programs of up to two years in length, or longer if they include paid training, like an apprenticeship.Expanding the impact of PathwaysHow long will it take me to complete a program? How much does it cost? How much might I make when I finish, and how might that compare with another occupation? These are all questions prospective students often think about when considering a new training program, but the answers aren’t always easy to find online, making it difficult to find the right program to match their career aspirations. To reach the goal of making Pathways available nationwide, we’re asking organizations to structure their program data to ensure their programs can be easily discovered not only on their websites, but also on Google Search. Learn more about eligibility and how to structure your data to help Americans find a path to their next job."

It does this while using less storage and memory, helping your phone stay fast. Google Go has been available in a few countries and on Android (Go edition) devices since 2017, and starting today, it’s available on the Play Store worldwide. Millions of people have already used Google Go to find information on the web and make sense of the world around them. But we know that people everywhere can sometimes struggle with spotty connections, phone storage, and reading or translating text.Reading made easierEarlier this year at I/O, we showcased Lens in Google Go, a way for you to read, translate and search the words you see by using your camera. When you find text you’d like help with, open Lens and point your camera at it to hear the words read out loud to you, translate them, or both.",

In Google Podcasts for web, you’ll be able to search for relevant shows and episodes and listen right there on your computer or phone. As always, your listening progress is synced everywhere, so you can pick up where you left off anywhere you use Google Podcasts.As part of our work to help podcasters build audiences and grow their businesses, we’ll soon add the ability for publishers to specify where you can listen to their podcasts, such as other apps or websites. This means you’ll be able to discover podcasts that may be exclusively available by purchase or subscription.These new features are available starting today, beginning with people using English in the U.S. So the next time you're looking for a podcast about an old hobby, a rising star in Hollywood, or anything else that piques your interest, your search will be easier than ever."

            "Sometimes when you use Google, you’re seeking information when timeliness matters, even if your query doesn’t spell that out. For example, when you search for something like “income brackets,” it’s likely that you’re looking for this year’s tax information, not last year’s.",
            "On the other hand, for many queries, the most useful information isn’t necessarily found among the most recent web results. For instance, if you ask “Why is the sky red at sunset,” the underlying explanation doesn’t change over time, and the clearest description is often found on an older page. Prioritizing fresh content wouldn’t necessarily yield better results. At the core of Search is language understanding, and our systems don’t understand language the same way humans do. This is why we’re constantly developing new ways to better understand your searches and provide relevant results, especially in cases where there is useful context that is implied, like whether freshness matters.As part of our ongoing efforts to make Search work better for you, a new algorithm update improves our systems’ understanding of what information remains useful over time and what becomes out-of-date more quickly. This is particularly helpful for featured snippets, a feature in Search that highlights pages that our systems determine are most likely to have the information you’re looking for. For queries where fresh information is important, our systems will try to find the most useful and up-to-date featured snippets.  Here are some examples where fresh featured snippets are especially helpful. You might be looking for information that is updated on a regular basis, like the next full moon, the winner of a reality TV show, or upcoming holidays.",
            "Other information gets more accurate over time. For example, as an event approaches, we learn more specific details. A fresher page about an upcoming TV premiere might have more specific information and other useful content, like trailers, that you can click through to view.",

            "Nothing says summer like the jingle of an ice cream truck—and cooling off with a (quickly melting) tasty treat. But these days, Americans aren’t just settling for chocolate and vanilla.  To celebrate National Ice Cream Day on July 21, we’ve rounded up this year’s top trending ice cream-related searches across the U.S.—and found more people are looking to experience new flavors, types, forms and even temperatures. Global treats    This year, searches for ice cream have moved away from your typical neighborhood ice cream truck and gone international. Searches for Mexican ice cream have gone up, thanks to people looking to have a taste of the raw milk, hand-churned, wooden-barrelled, sweet and spicy creation. Japan’s creations are also trending, with chewy and colorful mochi sparking interest, along with “fish ice cream,” or taiyaki, fish-shaped cakes that make tasty ice cream cones. And the Italian classic, gelato, has U.S. searchers craving its dense, silky texture. Gym worthy“Keto ice cream” has reached the dessert menu, with people searching for options that cut out carbs. Similarly, Americans are searching for “protein ice cream,” which boosts protein levels by using milk protein concentrate or whey protein. Others who aren’t so diet conscious are searching for fried ice cream. After breading, the scoop is quickly deep-fried to create a crispy shell around it. It’s served warm from the outside, but with a cold, sweet heart.Unconventionally frosty   Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry are still ice cream royalty when it comes to searches. But they have some competition. Filipino Ube ice cream has warmed up to Americans with its intense purple color. And green ice cream, like matcha and avocado varieties, has also seen searches grow this year. Snow ice cream is also a big thing this year, and you won’t believe its main ingredient: actual snow!In case you need a little push to decide what to order, here’s the full list of trending searches on this tasty topic:  Top trending ice cream types in 2019 in the U.S: Snow ice creamKeto ice creamMexican ice creamIce cream barsFish ice creamMochi ice creamGelatoIce cream sundaeFried ice creamProtein ice creamTop trending ice cream flavors in 2019 in the U.S.: Strawberry ice creamUbe ice creamChocolate ice creamCoffee ice creamVanilla ice creamOreo ice creamMango ice creamCoconut ice creamMatcha ice creamAvocado ice cream"

            "When you come to Google Search, our goal is to connect you with useful information as quickly as possible. That information can take many forms, and over the years the search results page has evolved to include not only a list of blue links to pages across the web, but also useful features to help you find what you’re looking for even faster. Some examples include featured snippets, which highlight results that are likely to contain what you’re looking for; Knowledge Panels, which can help you find key facts about an individual or other topic in the world; and predictive features like Autocomplete that help you navigate Search more quickly.",
            "Because these features are highlighted in a unique way on the page, or may show up when you haven’t explicitly asked for them, we have policies around what should and should not appear in those spaces. This means that in some cases, we may correct information or remove those features from a page.This is quite different from how we approach our web and image search listings and how those results rank in Search, and we thought it would be helpful to explain why, using a few examples.Featured SnippetsOne helpful information format is featured snippets, which highlight web pages that our systems determine are especially likely to contain what you’re looking for. Because their unique formatting and positioning can be interpreted as a signal of quality or credibility, we’ve published standards for what can appear as a featured snippet.We don’t allow the display of any snippets that violate our policies by being sexually explicit, hateful, violent, harmful or lacking expert consensus on public interest topics. Our automated systems are designed to avoid showing snippets that violate these policies. However, if our systems don’t work as intended and a violating snippet appears, we’ll remove it. In such cases, the page is not removed as a web search listing; it’s simply not highlighted as a featured snippet.The Knowledge GraphThe Knowledge Graph in Google Search reflects our algorithmic understanding of facts about people, places and things in the world. The Knowledge Graph automatically maps the attributes and relationships of these real-world entities from information gathered from the web, structured databases, licensed data and other sources. This collection of facts allows us to respond to queries like \"Bessie Coleman\" with a Knowledge Panel with facts about the famous aviator.Information from the Knowledge Graph is meant to be factual and is presented as such. However, while we aim to be as accurate as possible, our systems aren’t perfect, nor are all the sources of data available. So we collect user feedback and may manually verify and update information if we learn something is incorrect and our systems have not self-corrected. We have developed tools and processes to provide these corrections back to sources like Wikipedia, with the goal of improving the information ecosystem more broadly. Furthermore, we give people and organizations the ability to claim their Knowledge Panels and provide us with authoritative feedback on facts about themselves, and if we otherwise are made aware of incorrect information, we work to fix those errors. If an image or a Google Images results preview that’s shown in a Knowledge Panel does not accurately represent the person, place or thing, we’ll also fix the error. Predictive featuresThere are other features that are “predictive,” like Autocomplete and Related Searches, which are tools to help you navigate Search more quickly. As you type each character into the search bar, Autocomplete will match what you’re typing to common searches to help you save time. On the search results page, you may see a section of searches labeled “People also search for,” which is designed to help you navigate to related topics if you didn’t find what you were looking for, or to explore a different dimension of a topic.Because you haven’t asked to see these searches, we’re careful about not showing predictions that might be shocking or offensive or could have a negative impact on groups or individuals. Read more about our policies.You can still issue any search you’d like, but we won’t necessarily show all possible predictions for common searches. If no predictions appear or if you’re expecting to see a related search and it’s not there, it might be that our algorithms have detected that it contains potentially policy-violating content, the prediction has been reported and found to violate our policies, or the search may not be particularly popular.While we do our best to prevent inappropriate predictions, we don’t always get it right. If you think a prediction violates one of our policies, you can report a prediction.Across all of these features, we do not want to shock or offend anyone with content that they did not explicitly seek out, so we work to prevent things like violence or profanity from appearing in these special formats.Web listingsWhile we’ve talked mostly about helpful features that appear on the search results page, the results that probably come to mind most are our web listings—the familiar “blue links” of web page results, thumbnails displayed in a grid in Google Images or videos from the web in video mode.In these cases, the ranking of the results is determined algorithmically. We do not use human curation to collect or arrange the results on a page. Rather, we have automated systems that are able to quickly find content in our index--from the hundreds of billions of pages we have indexed by crawling the web--that are relevant to the words in your search.To rank these, our systems take into account a number of factors to determine what pages are likely to be the most helpful for what you’re looking for. You can learn more about this on our How Search Works site.While we intend to provide relevant results and prioritize the most reliable sources on a given topic, as with any automated system, our search algorithms aren’t perfect. You might see sites that aren’t particularly relevant to your search term rising to the top, or perhaps a page that does not contain trustworthy information rank above a more official website. When these problems arise, people often take notice and ask us whether we intend to “fix” the issue. Often what they might have in mind is that we’d manually re-order or remove a particular result from a page. As we’ve said many times in the past, we do not take the approach of manually intervening on a particular search result to address ranking challenges.This is for a variety of reasons. We receive trillions of searches each year, so “fixing” one query doesn’t improve the issue for the many other variations of the same query or help improve search overall. So what do we do instead? We approach all changes to our Search systems in the same way: we learn from these examples to identify areas of improvement. We come up with solutions that we believe could help not just those queries, but a broad range of similar searches. We then rigorously test the change using insights from live experiments and data from human search rater evaluations. If we determine that the change provides overall positive benefits-- making a large number of search results more helpful, while preventing significant losses elsewhere-- we launch that change.Our search algorithms are complex math equations that rely on hundreds of variables, and last year alone, we made more than 3,200 changes to our search systems. Some of these were visible launches of new features, while many others were regular updates meant to keep our results relevant as content on the web changes. And some are also improvements based on issues we identified, either via public reports or our own ongoing quality evaluations. Unlike with Search features where we are able to quickly correct issues that violate our policies, sometimes identifying the root cause of ranking issues can take time, and improvements may not happen immediately.. But as we have been for more than 20 years, we are always committed to identifying these challenges and working to make Search better.Spam ProtectionsThis is not to say that there aren’t policies and guidelines that apply to our web listings. Content there has to meet our long-standing webmaster guidelines, which protect users against things like spam, malware and deceptive sites. Our spam protection systems automatically work to prevent our ranking systems from rewarding such content. In cases where our spam systems don’t work, we have long taken manual actions against pages or sites. We report these actions through the Manual Actions report in our Search Console tool, in hopes that site owners will curb such behavior. These actions are not linked to any particular search results or query. They’re taken against affected content generally.Legal and Policy-based RemovalsAs our mission is to provide broad access to information, we remove pages from our results in limited circumstances, when required by law--such as child abuse imagery and copyright infringement claims--and in narrow cases where we have developed policies to protect people, such as content that has sensitive personal information. Some of these legal and policy actions do remove results for particular searches, such as someone’s name. However, none of these removals happen because Google has chosen to “fix” poor results. Rather, these are acts of legal compliance and applications of publicly documented policies to help keep people safe.Overall, we’re constantly striving to make our search results and features on the results page as useful and reliable as possible, and we value your feedback to help us understand where we can do better."

            "When astronauts set foot on the Moon 50 years ago, it was a technological triumph that sparked curiosity across the globe. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins inspired us to learn more about space and life here on Earth. A similar spirit of curiosity and exploration has always been core to Google, with our mission to make the universe of knowledge accessible to people around the world. So on the anniversary of the Moon landing, we’re bringing you new ways to learn about this milestone of human achievement, including new perspectives and stories that celebrate the lesser-known figures who made it happen.Starting today, in collaboration with the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, you can get up close to the command module that carried Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins to the Moon. To get started, search for “Apollo 11” from your AR-enabled mobile device. You’ll get the option to see the module in 3D, so you can zoom in and check it out from all angles. Using augmented reality, you can then bring the command module into your space—your bedroom, the kitchen or wherever you are—to get a better sense of its size. And later this month, you can do the same thing with Neil Armstrong’s spacesuit and examine what astronauts wore on the surface of the Moon.",
            "You can also explore 20 new visual stories related to the lunar mission directly from Search. When you enter a space-related query—like “Apollo 11 mission”—on your mobile device, you’ll see visual stories from the Smithsonian about the mission, the spacecraft, and the people who made it possible. These full screen, tappable visual stories feature photos, videos and information about the space journey.",
            "One of the stories that I found personally inspiring was of Margaret Hamilton, known for helping coin the term “software engineering,” and creating the on-board software for Apollo 11. Among other tasks, this software made sure the Apollo 11 lunar module’s system could manage the information it was receiving and safely land on the lunar surface.",
            "Google Arts & Culture has 40 new exhibits about Apollo 11, like Walter Cronkite’s reflections on humankind’s first steps, or a lesson on how to put on a space suit and pack snacks for the journey. There’s a lot to learn--the inside of your command module is a good place to take notes. And there’s more: starting July 15, Google Earth will have several new tours and quizzes to help you visually explore more about the Moon mission, NASA and the world of space exploration.Space has always been near and dear to our hearts, whether it’s helping you explore the International Space Station through Street View, celebrate the first photo of a black hole, or simply satisfy your curiosity on Google Search. Try searching for “moon” (or “🌙”) on Google Photos to see your snapshots of our neighbor. Ask the Google Assistant questions to learn fun facts about the Moon, like what sports have been played on the surface. And be sure to visit Google.com on the 20th for another special Moon-related surprise. Apollo 11 continues to have a profound impact on our planet’s history. We hope this is just the beginning of your space explorations. 🚀"

            "Hot dog! It’s BBQ season. If the increasing number of dads in aprons and bucket hats doesn’t give it away, an uptick in Google searches for “sauce” certainly has. We just couldn’t keep this information bottled up, so let’s ketchup on the uniquely searched sauces that reveal each state’s taste for BBQ. Here’s what the U.S. is relishing this summer. Keeping tradition aliveBarbecue is America’s summertime fuel—it’s what gives us the energy to swim all day and stay awake for fireworks at night. And when it comes down to it, basic BBQ is delicious on its own without the bells and whistles. More than 30 percent of states agreed by opting for traditional barbecue sauce recipes—and 13 of those states were willing to go the extra mile by preparing homemade concoctions, searching for “homemade bbq sauce” the most. As my mother would say, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”Fixin’ to eatSpeaking of tradition, everyone knows that southerners take their barbecue seriously—and have a serious sense of pride. Nearly 25 percent of U.S. states searched for “white” barbecue sauce recipes, also known as Alabama white sauce. You know what they say, mayo for dayos. But six states (and DC) preferred what’s known as Carolina sauce, including the Carolinas (naturally), where they’re just searching for “vinegar sauce.”Shaking it upSome states are bored with standard barbecue sauces and are looking to mix things up. Take Colorado and Minnesota, who are hankering for korean-style sauce. Folks in Florida are craving tropical, guava flavor. Our New Jersey friends are in the market for more meat (how much bacon is too much bacon?). And in Illinois, some families are looking to spike, oops, I mean spice up their barbecue by adding bourbon. But the award for the most original barbecue sauce flavor goes to Hawaii, where … get this … they’ve been searching for “Hawaiian” bbq sauce.Slim pickingsWhile many are looking for a new flavor this year, a good chunk of the U.S. will be passing on the potato salad and opting for healthy options around the grill with searches for diet-friendly recipes. Here are the highlights: Iowa and Texas are looking for sugar-free alternatives, while folks in Arizona, Michigan, Missouri, Oregon, Washington and Virginia are on the Hunt(’s) for keto-friendly sauces. New Hampshire and Nebraska are cutting back by finding “low carb” options, while Massachusetts is taking it one step further by searching for “calorie free.” Uh, good luck there, MA.",
            "So for anyone who's standing over the grill this week, wondering what to slather on: there is no right answer, just freedom to choose from a vast array of options."

            "When you’re searching for a song’s lyrics, often you’ll see an information box in Search that shows the lyrics on the page. This feature has been under scrutiny this week, so we wanted to explain how it works and where the lyrics come from.How lyrics appear in SearchLyrics can appear in information boxes and on Knowledge Panels in Search when you’re looking for songs or lyrics. While we do this to help you find that information quickly, we also ensure that the songwriters are paid for their creative work. To do that, we pay music publishers for the right to display lyrics, since they manage the rights to these lyrics on behalf of the songwriters.Where the lyrics text comes fromHere’s something you might not know: music publishers often don’t have digital copies of the lyrics text. In these cases, we—like music streaming services and other companies—license the lyrics text from third parties.We do not crawl or scrape websites to source these lyrics. The lyrics that you see in information boxes on Search come directly from lyrics content providers, and they are updated automatically as we receive new lyrics and corrections on a regular basis.News reports this week suggested that one of our lyrics content providers is in a dispute with a lyrics site about where their written lyrics come from. We’ve asked our lyrics partner to investigate the issue to ensure that they’re following industry best practices in their approach. We always strive to uphold high standards of conduct for ourselves and from the partners we work with. To help make it clearer where the lyrics come from, we’ll soon include attribution to the third party providing the digital lyrics text. We will continue to take an approach that respects and compensates rights-holders, and ensures that music publishers and songwriters are paid for their work."

            "SOS alerts help you quickly access authoritative, real-time information during times of crisis. Today, we’re improving SOS alerts by adding visual information about natural disasters and a new navigation warning system on Google Maps so you can more reliably know where a disaster is and anticipate where it’s headed. Read on to learn about what’s changing, along with three ways to help you stay connected and informed during times of emergency.Hurricane forecast cones, earthquake shakemaps and flood forecastsWith SOS alerts, you can already see important crisis information—a summary of what’s happening, relevant news stories, emergency phone numbers and websites, Twitter updates from local authorities, and tips to help you find your way to safety. Now, you’ll also be able to see detailed visualizations about hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods to give you a better understanding of the situation on the ground.In the days leading up to a hurricane, you’ll see a crisis notification card on Google Maps that automatically appears if you’re near the impacted area. This card will direct you to a hurricane forecast cone, which shows the prediction of the storm’s trajectory along with information about what time it’s likely to hit certain areas, so you can use this information to plan how to react.After an earthquake strikes, tapping on the crisis card will display the earthquake’s shakemap—a visualization that shows you its epicenter, its magnitude, along with color coding to indicate how intense the shaking was in surrounding areas. This information can help you quickly assess the reach of the earthquake and and identify areas likely to have experienced the highest impact.  And in India, where over 20 percent of global flood-related fatalities occur, you’ll now be able to see flood forecasts that show you where flooding is likely to occur in addition to the expected severity in different areas.",
            "Crisis navigation warnings on Google MapsLater this summer, you’ll see a prominent alert if we think your route may be affected by crisis activity— and when possible, we’ll do our best to route you away from the disrupted area.",
            "During a crisis, every minute matters. Here are three other ways you can use Google Maps to stay connected and quickly get the help and information you need:Share your location: Letting loved ones know where you are is vital during fast-moving, chaotic situations. From the crisis card, you can share your live location with friends and family for as little as 15 minutes, or until you decide to stop sharing.See and report road closures: Turn on the traffic layer to see all known and suspected road closures in an area. If you encounter a closure on your drive, you can report it to help others nearby. You can also confirm whether or not a road is still closed with a quick tap on Android.Share crisis information directly with the ones you care about: Tap on the share button from the crisis card to keep friends and family up to date about the situation. They’ll be directed to Google Maps where they’ll see all available crisis information - which could include a summary, visualizations, emergency contact information, and more.Hurricane forecast cones and earthquake shakemaps will start rolling out in the coming weeks on Android, iOS, desktop, and mobile web. Flood forecasts visualizations will soon roll out starting in Patna, India, and then expand to the Ganges and Brahmaputra regions on Android, desktop, and mobile web."

            "I always wanted to be a Marine, but it wasn't until the first day of rugby practice at the Naval Academy my sophomore year that I knew I was going to be a Marine. One of my coaches—an active duty larger-than-life Marine officer—took one look at me and declared, \"Yep, you're going to be a Marine.\" That was Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Shea, who was killed the following year in combat near Fallujah, Iraq. He was the first person I knew to be killed in action and the first person I think of on Memorial Day, the federal holiday remembering and honoring persons who have died while serving in the Armed Forces. People often confuse Memorial Day as another Veterans Day. The more you learn or the closer you are to its true meaning, the harder it is to balance the prescribed celebration with the sadness and solemnity of the sacrifices by the fallen men and women who are remembered on this day. But that’s the point: Remembrance. Different groups and people honor the day in different ways. For some, it’s a time of sorrow, guilt, or regret. For others, it’s an upbeat celebration of memories. Regardless of your approach, the important thing is that you remember, reflect, and then do what feels right. If you’re looking for a way to honor those who have sacrificed, we invite you to join us. The National Moment of Remembrance occurs at 3 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. The act, passed by Congress, asks that all Americans pause for one minute and simply remember. Baseball games will stop. Amtrak whistles will sound. And if you come to the Google homepage on desktop, you’ll find an experience that will allow you to play Taps—the recognizable and haunting bugle call that is played at military funerals and is just about a minute long. That’s what I’ll be doing at 3 p.m. I’ll think about Kevin, Travis, Betsy, Van, Wes, Matt and others (the list never gets smaller), and I’ll be sad—but I’ll celebrate in the ways they would have wanted.",
            "I’ll always wonder what Kevin saw in me (it certainly wasn’t my haircut), but I take pride in bearing witness to his legacy and that of everyone else who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country."

For example, it’s one thing to read that a great white shark can be 18 feet long. It’s another to see it up close in relation to the things around you.

            "New features in Google LensPeople have already asked Google Lens more than a billion questions about things they see. Lens taps into machine learning (ML), computer vision and tens of billions of facts in the Knowledge Graph to answer these questions. Now, we’re evolving Lens to provide more visual answers to visual questions.Say you’re at a restaurant, figuring out what to order. Lens can automatically highlight which dishes are popular--right on the physical menu. When you tap on a dish, you can see what it actually looks like and what people are saying about it, thanks to photos and reviews from Google Maps.",
            "To pull this off, Lens first has to identify all the dishes on the menu, looking for things like the font, style, size and color to differentiate dishes from descriptions. Next, it matches the dish names with the relevant photos and reviews for that restaurant in Google Maps.",
            "Lens can be particularly helpful when you’re in an unfamiliar place and you don’t know the language. Now, you can point your camera at text and Lens will automatically detect the language and overlay the translation right on top of the original words, in more than 100 languages. We're also working on other ways to connect helpful digital information to things in the physical world. For example, at the de Young Museum in San Francisco, you can use Lens to see hidden stories about the paintings, directly from the museum’s curators beginning next month. Or if you see a dish you’d like to cook in an upcoming issue of Bon Appetit magazine, you’ll be able to point your camera at a recipe and have the page come to life and show you exactly how to make it.",
            "Bringing Lens to Google GoMore than 800 million adults worldwide struggle to read things like bus schedules or bank forms. So we asked ourselves: “What if we used the camera to help people who struggle with reading?”When you point your camera at text, Lens can now read it out loud to you. It highlights the words as they are spoken, so you can follow along and understand the full context of what you see. You can also tap on a specific word to search for it and learn its definition. This feature is launching first in Google Go, our Search app for first-time smartphone users. Lens in Google Go is just over 100KB and works on phones that cost less than $50.",

Unsure what kind of job you want? Try searching “work from home jobs” to explore open roles across industries.For employers looking to help potential remote workers better discover these opportunities, we’re using new Schema.org markup for job locations and applicant location requirements to indicate work-from-home roles and any related geographic restrictions. Regardless of the specific words employers use to describe remote jobs, those marked up listings will be discoverable through this new feature. We’re already working with a wide range of job listing sites, including Working Nomads, We Work Remotely and ZipRecruiter, and the number of remote jobs you can find via Google is growing by the day as providers from across the web implement this markup. We’re also making this capability available to any employer or job board to use on their own property through our Cloud Talent Solution.We hope these tools are useful in finding your next work from home opportunity or finding the right candidates, regardless of where they call home."

            "Editor’s note: The Google Podcasts creator program, run by PRX, provides 20 weeks of training, mentorship, and seed funding to promising podcasters, with the aim of promoting underrepresented voices throughout the industry and around the world. Applications for the next round are currently open and will be accepted until 11:59pm ET, Sunday, April 14.Catalina May and Martín Cruz, the team behind “Las Raras” (“The Outsiders”), are independent podcasters based in Santiago, Chile. They are one of the six teams participating in the first round of the program. Their training began in January 2019 with a week-long intensive “bootcamp” at the PRX Podcast Garage in Boston and will culminate in a final showcase on June 19 in Boston. A few days ago, while reporting about Chilean countrymen fighting for their land, we contacted a source to request an interview. Our source asked us where the story would appear. “We have an independent podcast,” we explained. “It’s called ‘Las Raras,’ and we are part of the Google Podcasts creator program.”Then, silence. For many seconds. We knew what we had to ask.“Do you know what a podcast is?”She did not.This is a very common situation for us. Not only in Chile where we live, but also in Latin America broadly, many people haven’t even heard the word podcast, much less listened to one.",
            "When we arrived in Boston for the Google Podcasts creator program bootcamp, we experienced the total opposite of our situation in Santiago. At the PRX Podcast Garage, we met amazing trainers and the five other teams in the program. It was a dream to talk about podcasting for twelve hours a day with a diverse group of people who share our passion.Through the other teams, we learned how many different goals a podcast might have: raise awareness about LGBTQ+ people’s lives in a place where homosexuality is illegal (“AfroQueer”), tell stories from the Filipino diaspora (“Long Distance”), reflect on modern beauty standards (“The Colored Girl Beautiful”), introduce children to Puerto Rican history (“Timestorm”), or talk about car culture and road rage (“Who Taught You How to Drive?!”).We created our podcast, “Las Raras,” in 2015, inspired (like many) by the first season of “Serial.” As a journalist and a sound engineer, we heard right away what podcasts could do. This intimate medium is perfect for telling stories of people who are frequently overlooked, stories of people challenging norms and stories of people defying the status quo. In other words, podcasts let us tell stories we feel passionate about and are not often heard in Chile. Right away, we loved the innovation and openness podcasting offered. But it was daunting, too. We had to learn a new way of interviewing and structuring stories, and how to use sound without visuals. There were almost no other podcasts in Chile at that time, too.It was also financially risky. Our first two seasons were self-financed. Luckily, for our third season, we got some support from the International Women’s Media Foundation. It helped, but we were still feeling quite alone and facing an uncertain road ahead. When we first heard about the Google Podcasts creator program, it seemed perfect for us, because its goal is to increase the diversity of voices in the podcasting industry. We put our hearts and souls into the application, making clear that we were at a critical time for our podcast. Two days before Christmas, we received an email confirming that we had been chosen. It took us a couple of weeks to really believe that it was happening. It’s an honor, but also a huge responsibility. We know the stories we want to tell, and the support of the Google Podcasts creator program will allow us to take “Las Raras” to the next level. Our goal in the program is to find a way to be successful on a long-term basis. With the support of Google, PRX, our mentors and our fellow podcasters, we are focusing our attention on better understanding the needs of our audience, and developing a sustainable business model for “Las Raras.” The program offers the training to improve the quality of the stories we love to tell, and those we know our audience wants to hear."

The phrase is appropriate for moments both big and small, and ignites the internal spark that motivates both personal and professional achievements. As black women, it’s rare to see our own, varied images reflected back to us in media and pop culture. But this film celebrates women—past and present, famous and unknown—who have broken down barriers in many fields and industries.

            "53 percent of prescription drug abuse starts with drugs obtained from family or friends, so we’re working alongside government agencies and nonprofit organizations to help people safely remove excess or unused opioids from their medicine cabinets. Last year, we partnered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for National Prescription Take Back Day by developing a Google Maps API  locator tool to help people dispose of their prescription drugs at temporary locations twice a year. With the help of this tool, the DEA and its local partners collected a record 1.85 million pounds of unused prescription drugs in 2018.Today, we’re making it easier for Americans to quickly find disposal locations on Google Maps and Search all year round. A search for queries like “drug drop off near me” or “medication disposal near me” will display permanent disposal locations at your local pharmacy, hospital or government building so you can quickly and safely discard your unneeded medication.",
            "This pilot has been made possible thanks to the hard work of many federal agencies, states and pharmacies. Companies like Walgreens and CVS Health, along with state governments in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania have been instrumental in this project, contributing data with extensive lists of public and private disposal locations. The DEA is already working with us to provide additional location data to expand the pilot.For this pilot, we also looked to public health authorities—like HHS—for ideas on how technology can help communities respond to the opioid crisis. In fact, combining disposal location data from different sources was inspired by a winning entry at the HHS’s Opioid Code-A-Thon held a year ago.We’ll be working to expand coverage and add more locations in the coming months. To learn more about how your state or business can bring more disposal locations to Google Maps and Search, contact RXdisposal-data@google.com today."

            "Hearts beating with worry over a potential conversation hearts shortage, people have been on the hunt for a candy-free way to express their affection this Valentine’s Day. Looks like we’re in the clear, but  many people still turned to Google for ideas, advice, emojis and more.To celebrate all the ways that people around the world show their love (as artists have done for ages), we’re sharing our Romance Report to give you a global glimpse at how people look to say “Be Mine” in their own special way.“What is love?”Well, first of all, it’s one of the top questions people ask about love, according to Google Trends. But as Valentine’s Day nears, we dug into one of the other most popular questions about love since February 14 last year: “What are the 5 love languages?”Gary Chapman’s 1995 book has caught people’s attention as they look to understand the ways in which they and their partners prefer to express love, and search interest in “love languages” is at an all time high. With that in mind, here are some of the top questions and insights about the love languages.Let’s start with some quality time on our most searched love language (and searches are on the rise, to boot). These are the top questions related to both quality time with your S.O. since the last V-Day:How to spend quality time with your partner?How to set boundaries with your significant other for quality time?How to have more quality time with your partner?What does spending quality time with your other significant mean?What to do when your partner is touch and you are quality time?If there’s one thing we can learn from Google Trends, it’s that words of affirmation can be hard, and people often look for advice on how to express their feelings. Here are the top searched “how to say” relationship questions:How to say sorry to your partner?How to say happy birthday to an ex?How to say happy birthday to a loved one?How to say something difficult to spouse?How to say love you to your partner?The chocolate company in Hershey, PA isn’t the only one concerned with hugs and kisses. These expressions of physical touch (our next love language!) are on people’s minds and in their searches. “Kiss” is more searched than “hug” in every country, and on average, “kiss” is 7 times more searched than “hug” worldwide. So what are they searching for? Here are the sweet and simple questions many people ask:Top “kiss” questions worldwide, since last Valentine’s Day:How to kiss a girl?How to kiss a guy?How to kiss someone?How to kiss a boy?How to kiss well?Top “hug” questions worldwide, since last Valentine’s Day:How to cuddle?How to hug a girl?How to hug?What is cuddling?How to hug a guy?With all the “gift for” searches around Valentine’s Day (the second busiest week for these searches apart from Christmas week), you’d think everyone’s love language is receiving gifts. If your partner is one of the many who appreciate a heartfelt token of admiration, or if you’ve got kids who are all about collecting Valentine’s cards, perhaps DIY is the way to go.These are the top searched queries related to do-it-yourself and Valentines' Day in the past 12 months, worldwide:DIY valentine gifts for himDIY valentines cardsDIY valentine decorationsDIY valentine boxDIY valentine gifts for herAt long last, we’ve reached our final (and apparently most enigmatic) love language: acts of service.

Here are the top 10 languages into which people translate that phrase:SpanishPortugueseKoreanFrenchArabicRussianJapaneseGermanIndonesianSimplified ChineseCall the love doctorWhen in doubt, the Google Assistant is there to help you out with translations, animal inspo and even a serenade or two.To take a hint from our furry friends and learn how creatures across the animal kingdom show their affection, just say “Hey Google, tell me a fact about love.” Spoiler alert: did you know that a male penguin proposes to a female penguin by throwing the nicest rock he can find by her feet? If she picks it up, they’re engaged!For some extra words of affirmation, “Hey Google, serenade me” is guaranteed to land you a love song.Tell your Assistant, “Hey Google, Happy Valentine’s Day,” to learn how to say “I love you” in 8 different languages, including Korean, Mandarin, Hindi, French, Spanish, Danish, Gujarat,  and Indonesian.Curious to uncover which “dynamic duo” you and your Assistant are?

            "In August 2018, Google made a commitment to veterans, military spouses, and service members transitioning to civilian careers. At that time, we announced a job search experience that uses military occupational specialty codes to connect service members and veterans with open jobs that call for skills developed during their time in service.In the months since, we’ve continued our work to make it even more useful for those who are searching for civilian jobs and the amazing people who support and guide them. People like Kristen Rheinlander, who works as the Transition Site Manager of the USO Pathfinder Program at Fort Hood, Texas. A self-described Army brat whose father served in the military for 25 years, Kristen came to the USO as a volunteer 4 years ago. Today, she heads up a team that works with service members and their families as they prepare for a new challenge: figuring out what comes next.",
            "Every new challenge has a first step, and for Kristen, it starts with helping people see the connections between the skills they developed in the military and civilian jobs. By introducing her clients to the Google Search tool early in the process, she’s able to show them the types of occupations that align with their expertise, whether demand for a field is projected to grow, and active job listings in a given geographic area. It’s a confidence booster, she says—the search tool is a translator that “puts words to the unknown,” providing greater clarity for clients unsure of which roles, companies, and industries align with what they’re looking to do next. After finding a lead through the Google Search tool, Kristen works with her clients to begin crafting resumes that highlight their military experiences in language civilian employers use and understand.",
            "Helping people find connections between skills developed in the military and civilian jobs is just one of the many ways we’re working to create useful tools and programs for transitioning service members, veterans, and military families—a community that’s sacrificed so much in service to our country. For the over 2.5 million veterans who’ve decided that their next step is owning their own business, we’ve created a “Veteran-Led” attribute for their Google My Business profiles. With this badge, veteran-led businesses stand out across Google Search and Maps. And for transitioning service members and military spouses who are interested in the growing field of IT support, we’ve made it easier for them to earn Google’s IT Support Professional Certificate through a $2.5 million grant to the USO. Visit Grow with Google to learn more about job search and our other tools and programs for veterans.Through these resources, we’re working to help service members, veterans, and their families prepare #ForWhateversNext."

            "For 18 years, Wikipedia has been the internet’s encyclopedia, contributing to the vast knowledge available on the open web, and the Wikimedia Foundation has long shared in our mission of making information accessible to people around the world.Our organizations have partnered throughout the years on initiatives that further our joint goals around knowledge access, including making information available through Google Search. Many individual Googlers also show their support for Wikimedia, through donations and from active participation in the community. We look forward to continuing our close partnership with new initiatives and commitments to achieving our shared goals.As the next billion people come online, it’s critical that the content on the web reflect the diversity of its users. Currently, the web is lacking content in many local languages and thus restricts the information that people can access. By collaborating on programs to increase the availability of local language content and providing technology tools for Wikipedia editors, we aim to bridge this gap and empower local editors to serve their communities with relevant content in their native languages. Creating new articles from scratch can be time and resource intensive for volunteer editors, and translation tools can be useful to help generate local language content. To make it easier for editors to create this native language content, we’re providing access to the Google Translate API through Wikipedia’s content translation tool at no cost. We’re also working with Wikimedia and their editor community to expand our Project Tiger initiative (now collectively referred to as GLOW - Growing Local Language Content on Wikipedia), which we piloted last year as a competition between 12 language communities in India to create more native language content. We will expand these programs with Wikimedia affiliates and volunteers to provide editors with resources and insights to drive the creation of new Wikipedia articles across 10 languages in India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and the Middle East and North Africa region.Bringing local language information online comes with new challenges in maintaining Wikipedia’s content and citation standards. Google Cloud Custom Search API helps editors ensure contributions are appropriately cited from sources. Our Cloud Vision API enables editors to digitize public domain books in Indic languages to include more diverse, reputable sources for citations. Both of these tools will be provided to Wikimedia at no cost. While efforts to empower editors will help them continue to add more information and knowledge to the web, we also aim to support the long-term health of the Wikimedia projects so they are  available for generations to come. To that end, Google.org is donating $2 million to the Wikimedia Endowment, the first of Google’s contributions to its fund for long term sustainability. This brings our total support to more than $7.5 million, which includes an additional $1.1 million to the Wikimedia Foundation annual fund during a special campaign last year where Google employees helped decide where to direct Google's donation dollars.With this continued partnership, we look forward to the strides we can make in bringing more of the world’s information online and making knowledge accessible to all."

            "Our goal with Gboard is to help you communicate in a way that’s comfortable and natural, regardless of the language you speak. While the ten most common languages cover about half of the world's population, many more thousands of languages are spoken by the other half. As the Next Billion Users come online, technology needs to support their languages so they can get the most out of using the internet. Today, Gboard offers more than 500 language varieties on Android, bringing a smart, AI-driven typing experience to many more people around the world. This means that more than 90% of the world can now type in their first language with Gboard, with keyboard layouts tailored to each language and typing smarts like autocorrect and predictive text.In December 2016, Gboard first launched on Android with about 100 language varieties. Over the last few months, more than one hundred new languages have been added to Gboard, such as Nigerian Pidgin (~30 million speakers), Rangpuri (~15 million speakers), Balinese (~3 million speakers), Pontic Greek (~800,000 speakers) and many more. A quick look at the layouts below shows the sheer diversity of input methods used across the world every day:",
            "Gboard currently supports more than 40 writing systems across the world, ranging from alphabets used across many languages, like Roman and Cyrillic, to scripts that are used for only one language, like Ol Chiki (used for Santali).",
            "Building technology that works across languages is important: without a keyboard tailored to your language, simple things like messaging friends or family can be a challenge. Often, keyboard apps don’t support the characters and scripts used for languages with a smaller speaking population. As an example, the Nigerian language \"Ásụ̀sụ̀ Ị̀gbò\" is impossible to type on an English keyboard. Plus, wouldn't it be frustrating to see nearly every word you type incorrectly autocorrected into another language? Many of Gboard’s newly added languages are traditionally not widely written, such as in newspapers or books, so they’re rarely found online. But as we spend more time on our phones on messaging apps and social media, people are now typing in these languages more than ever. The ability to easily type in these languages lets people communicate with others in the language they would normally speak face-to-face as well.How we add new languages to GboardIn addition to designing a new keyboard layout, every time a new language is added to Gboard we create a new machine learning language model. This model trains Gboard to know when and how to autocorrect your typing, or to predict your next word. For languages like English, which has only about 30 characters and large amounts of written materials widely available, this is easy. For many of the world's languages, though, this process is much harder.In order to train our machine learning language models, we need a text corpus (which is a database of lots of available texts written in a particular language). Often, finding text data in these languages can be challenging. When we can’t find data online, we’ll share a list of writing prompts with native speakers, so we can create new text corpora from scratch. (You can read more about our crawling efforts for these languages in one of our recent research papers.)Next, we focus on the layout design. Layout design for a new language on Gboard requires careful investigation and research to fit in all the characters in a way that makes sense to native speakers. If there isn’t a lot of information for the language available online, we'll analyze text corpora to figure out which characters to include and to determine how frequently they’re used. Depending on the language, we may tailor aspects of the layout, like the set of digits—for example, while English uses 0123456789, Hindi and other Indian languages written in Devanagari use ०१२३४५६७८९. Once we've built support for a language, we always invite a group of native speakers to test and fill out a survey to understand their typing experience. To see if your language is already supported in our latest Gboard release in the Play Store, check out the list of supported languages in our help center."

            "We first met Emmett at Adaptive Design Association, an organization near Google’s NYC office that builds custom adaptations for children with disabilities. Communicating for him is difficult—he uses a clear plastic word board and looks at specific squares to try and get across what he wants to say. We thought we might be able to help. At the time, we were working on a special Morse Code layout for Gboard. With its simple dot and dash encoding, Morse is a good fit for assistive tech like switch access and sip-and-puff devices. Emmett was hoping to learn Morse as a more robust form of communication, and we wanted to make a small game to help him learn the new alphabet.Our first attempt was a small connect-the-dots spelling toy that drew Emmett's favorite cartoon character and only took a few days to build. After watching Emmett get set up with his switches and start excitedly conquering pieces of the little Morse toy, we knew we wanted to do more. We partnered with Adaptive Design on a 48 hour hackathon, where independent designers and game developers worked with Emmett and another 4 kids to prototype games that made Morse code fun to learn.",
            "The kids played the role of creative directors, using their imagination to set the vision for their own games. Each game reflected their interests and personalities. Hannah’s passion for music led to a game where you play notes by typing them in Morse. Matthew combined his interest in soccer and spy thrillers to make a game where you shoot soccer balls at targets by typing their corresponding Morse letters. Emmett made a maze you solve writing different letters. Ben, who likes trains, made a game where YouTube videos are shown on a train once the correct letters are typed in Morse Code. And Olivia’s love for talent shows led to a game called “Alphabet’s Got Talent.”We’re posting the code for each independent team's games on the Experiments with Google website, where you can also find open-source examples that will help you get started with your own Morse-based apps. If you’re a developer, we hope these resources will inspire you to get involved with the community and make a difference by building your own accessibility projects."

            "The internet has enabled people worldwide to connect, create and distribute new works of art like never before. A key part of preserving this creative economy is ensuring creators and artists have a way to share and make money from their content—and preventing the flow of money to those who seek to pirate that content. Today, we're releasing our latest update on those efforts..Our 2018 \"How Google Fights Piracy\" report explains the programs, policies, and technology we put in place to combat piracy online and ensure continued opportunities for creators around the world.We invest significantly in the technology, tools and resources that prevent copyright infringement on our platforms. We also work with others across the industry on efforts to combat piracy. These efforts appear to be having an effect: around the world, online piracy has been decreasing, while spending on legitimate content is rising across content categories.Here are a few of our findings from this year's Piracy report:$3 billion+: The amount YouTube has paid to rights holders who have monetized use of their content in other videos through Content ID, our industry-leading rights management tool.$100 million+: The amount we’ve invested in building Content ID, including staffing and computing resources.$1.8 billion+: The amount YouTube paid to the music industry from October 2017 to September 2018 in advertising revenue alone3 billion+: The number of URLs that were removed from Search for infringing copyright since launching a submission tool for copyright owners and their agents.10 million+: The number of ads that were disapproved by Google in 2017 that were suspected of copyright infringement or that linked to infringing sites.As we continue our work in the years ahead, five principles guide our substantial investments in fighting piracy:Create more and better legitimate alternatives: Piracy often arises when it's difficult for consumers to access legitimate content. By developing products that make it easy for users to access legitimate content, like Google Play Music and YouTube, Google helps drive revenue for creative industries and give consumers choice.Follow the money: As the vast majority of sites dedicated to online piracy are doing so to make money, one way to combat them is to cut off their supply. We prevent actors that engage in copyright infringement from using our ads and monetization systems and we enforce these policies rigorously.Be efficient, effective, and scalable: We strive to implement anti-piracy solutions that work at scale. For example, as early as 2010, we began making substantial investments in streamlining the copyright removal process for search results. As a result, these improved procedures allow us to process copyright removal requests for search results at the rate of millions per week.Guard against abuse: Some actors will make false copyright infringement claims in order to have content they don't want online taken down. We’re committed to detecting and rejecting bogus infringement allegations, such as removals for political or competitive reasons.Provide transparency: We’re committed to providing transparency. In our Transparency Report, we disclose the number of requests we receive from copyright owners and governments to remove information from our services.Today, our services are generating more revenue for creators and rights holders, connecting more people with the content they love, and doing more to fight back against online piracy than ever before. We’re proud of the progress this report represents. Through continued innovation and partnership, we’re committed to curtailing infringement by bad actors while empowering the creative communities who make many of the things we love about the internet today."

Mini stickers also come in two other styles: “bold,” for when you might be feeling a little extra, and “sweet,” for when you want a softer touch.After you take a selfie, emoji Minis use Google’s machine learning algorithms, known as neural networks, to suggest a skin tone, hair style and accessories that you can fine tune. Then, you choose a color for your hair, facial hair or different types of head coverings and eyewear. Add freckles or wrinkles—a little or a lot—if you'd like. Design your Minis so they resemble what you look like in your eyes—or in your mind. 🤗",

            "On Google’s 20th anniversary last month, we announced updates to make Google Images a more useful place to explore the web through images. One of the ways we’re doing this is by bringing Lens to Google Images. We launched Lens to help you do more with what you see. People already love using it in their camera and on their photos–to find items in an outfit they like, learn more about landmarks, and identify that cute dog in the park. Lens is a natural fit for Google Images.",
            "Starting today, when you see something in an image that you want to know more about, like a landmark in a travel photo or wallpaper in a stylish room, you can use Lens to explore within the image.Similar to Lens in the Google Assistant and Google Photos, Lens in Google Images identifies things within an image you might want to learn about, and shows you similar ones. When you press the Lens button in Google Images, dots will appear on objects you can learn more about.Lens in Google Images can also make it easier to find and buy things you like online. For example, you might come to Google Images looking for ideas to redecorate your living room. During your search, you come across a couch you like in an image, but you may not know what style it is or where to buy it. All you need to do is press the Lens button, then either tap on a dot on the couch, or draw around it, and Google Images will show you related information and images. From there, you can learn more about it, or find places where you might be able to buy a similar couch.Lens in Google Images also helps website owners by giving them a new way to be discovered through a visual search, similar to a traditional Google Search.",
            "To start, the dots will appear on products and other objects Lens has identified, and in the coming months the dots will appear in more types of images, such as landmarks, animals and plants. You can still draw around anything you’re interested in inside of an image to get more information and see related content.Start exploring today. Lens in Images is now live on the mobile web for people in the U.S. searching in English, and will soon be rolled out to other countries, languages and other places you use Google Images."

            "Gboard, Google’s on-screen keyboard, is a tool that helps people communicate exactly the way they want on a mobile device. Gboard supports over 400 languages, thousands of emoji and stickers, and an endless number of GIFs.Part of helping people communicate is making sure Gboard is accessible for all people, and the languages they speak. One language not supported by Gboard, however, is American Sign Language. ASL isn’t a written language, so it’s not suited for a typical keyboard. However, ASL is one of the most expressive languages, and similar to other languages, has its own slang and regional variations. This makes it perfect for a visual communication format like stickers.We collaborated with Jessica Flores, a Deaf artist, advocate and popular YouTube creator, to design a series of animated stickers for Gboard that feature ASL. We talked to Jessica about her background, her experience creating the stickers, and how she hopes people might use them.",
            "Ryan: How did you get started doing YouTube videos?Jessica: I started my YouTube channel about two years ago. At the time, I was working at a coffee shop, and a lot of the customers would ask me the same questions about my hearing loss over and over again, which I totally don’t mind. But once I started noticing this, I began to wonder if there was a way I could educate a much larger audience, instead of just one person at a time. Ryan: What feedback have you received from other Deaf or Hard of Hearing people on your work?Jessica: I grew up being the only Deaf person I really knew, so I felt very alone and isolated. When I started my YouTube channel years later, I thought there was only going to be a few people who could relate to my content, but boy, was I wrong! I get messages and comments all the time from both Deaf and Hard of Hearing adults and kids telling me they can relate to my videos. Whenever I get these messages, it’s hands down, one of the best feelings in the world. Ryan: How do you typically use expressions like stickers/GIFs/emoji? What do you like/dislike about this experience? Jessica: I use stickers, emojis, and GIFs really often. Some might tell you, too often or, more-than-one-normally-should often. (Insert wide eye, straight big smile emoji here) Personally, a text message just doesn’t allow me to fully express what I am trying to say, or how I am feeling. I probably feel this way because I am a very animated person. Whenever I sign or talk, I feel like I always need to use all of my facial expressions and body language to express what I am trying to say. Even if it is just something simple like, “Hey can you pass the salt?” it ends up being very animated.Ryan: What was your vision for these stickers? How did the end product compare to your vision?Jessica: At the beginning of the project, I had no idea what direction these stickers were going to go in. I thought for sure the stickers would feature one character signing all the words. But after looking at all of our sketches, I realized I wanted a sticker set that would help spread Deaf awareness and expose American Sign Language to more people, even just a little bit. I knew that if we designed a character for the stickers who signed, only those who knew ASL would know what the signs meant, and those who didn’t know ASL might end up ignoring the set completely.We settled on the perfect solution: making the words become the characters. Now, if you know ASL, you will understand the whole set, as well as the slang. And if you don’t know ASL you will still be able to follow along with most of the signs their meanings.",
            "Ryan: Were there any challenges you encountered as an artist creating the stickers?Jessica: A lot of people don’t realize that, in sign language, a simple change in facial expression or body language can change a sign’s meaning completely. Just like how a tone of someone’s voice will allow you to figure out if they are mad at you, or if they’re asking you a question. So when I had a word like “No”, I had to think about what kind of “No” I wanted to sign. Did I want it to be a sad “no”, a happy “no”, a sarcastic “no”? Then, if I picked sad, I had to ask myself, “How sad is it? Is it so sad it’s crying or is it just bummed out sad?” There are so many ways to sign and say “no” that it was hard to pick just one. Ryan: How do you hope people will use them?Jessica: I hope it will inspire people to start learning basic ASL or the other many different types of sign language: Mexican Sign Language, British Sign Language, Filipino Sign Language, etc. My other hope is that the set will encourage people to start learning about Deaf/Hard of Hearing history, community, and culture. People still have a lot to learn about Deaf people. And the faster we can all learn about each other, the faster we can work towards making the world more accessible for one another."

            "Podcasting has quickly become one of the best ways to share and listen to stories, but its future depends on a diverse array of stories, voices and creators. With the launch of the Google Podcasts app in June, we’re working to make it easier for people around the world to find and access podcasts. While there are more podcasts than ever before, there continues to be an imbalance in who is creating them. Women and people of color are still underrepresented as hosts, and many of the world’s most popular podcasts hail from western, urban areas. In June we announced the Google Podcasts creator program, which aims to support these underrepresented voices in podcasting, and make it easier for people to learn how to get into this growing medium.Beginning today, through November 18th, the application window is official open globally for the first round of the Google Podcasts creator program, which will kick off in January 2019. We’re partnering with one of the best in the podcasting industry, PRX, who will lead and manage the program. PRX has demonstrated a long-time commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in the space. As a pioneer of the podcasting space, PRX will lend this valuable expertise to the podcasters in the program.The Google Podcasts creator program is focused on three main pillars: empowering and training underrepresented voices through an accelerator program, educating a global community with free tools, and showcasing participants’ work as a model for others. PRX, alongside a global advisory committee, will select teams to receive mentorship, seed funding, and an intensive 20-week training. Applications will be accepted from around the globe. You can learn more and apply to the program on PRX’s Google Podcasts creator program website. For podcast enthusiasts that want to learn more about what it takes to create a podcast, but are not yet ready to apply to the program, PRX will draw on learnings from the program to develop a series of broadly accessible podcasting 101 videos in multiple languages, as well.Podcasts are a way to bring additional voices, perspectives and experiences into your day-to-day life. The Google Podcasts creator program is designed to help support these voices, so that everyone can find a story that resonates with them."

            "“So you think you know every country in the world?” my late friend and drumming partner Richard Feynman said with a twinkle in his eye, back in 1977. “Well, then, whatever happened to Tannu Tuva?”I replied, “Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman—there is no such country!”But there was: Feynman remembered Tuva as a purple splotch on the map just outside of Outer Mongolia. In the 1930s Tuva issued dozens of marvelous triangular- and diamond-shaped stamps that he collected as a boy. Then the country mysteriously disappeared.His question turned into a quest—to learn everything we could about Tuva, and to get there ourselves. On the occasion of Google's 20th anniversary this month, I've been thinking about how different our search was then compared to today.Back then our main source of information was libraries—local, university, even the Library of Congress. Much of the information was in Russian (Tuva had been absorbed into Stalin’s Soviet Union during World War II), so we recruited a linguistic wizard named Glen Cowan to help. (Today you can use Google Translate.) We scoured card catalogs, microfilm reels, cross-library listings—and books that literally needed the dust blown off—in hopes of finding a useful nugget of information. Each nugget, rare and unexpected, delivered a small delight of discovery, and kept our quest alive.Search for “Tuva” today on Google and you’ll be showered with so many nuggets that you can’t possibly treasure them all.Back then it took us months to find a single grainy black-and-white photograph of Tuva; search for “images Tuva” on Google today and you’ll find a hundred color photographs in a second.Back then it took us a year to find a single hand-drawn map of Tuva’s exotically spelled capital; today, you can instantly see a detailed street map of Kyzyl based on satellite imagery, with current traffic conditions.Because information about Tuva was so difficult to find in the pre-Internet era, our quest was full of twists—much like a Feynman diagram (go ahead, search!). One twist took us to Moscow, where Cowan and I discovered and then brought the largest archaeological and ethnographic exposition ever from the Soviet Union to the United States. It included spectacular items from Tuva, of course. We thought the Nomads exhibition would provide us the key to finally setting foot in Kyzyl; it actually was the key for a dozen Soviet academicians to visit the mysterious Disneyland. No matter: we learned the meaning of the Taoist saying, “The reward is in the journey.”Undaunted, we spread our enthusiasm by sending out Xeroxed newsletters to our friends, encouraging them to pass them on and send back SASEs (self-addressed stamped envelopes) for future newsletters. We also set up a “Friends of Tuva hotline” (221-TUVA) to spread the latest information about the singing cowboys from Tuva riding in the 1993 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade. Each Tuvan cowboy could sing two notes simultaneously, something we could scarcely imagine when we read about it in books; today, YouTube has dozens of “Tuvan throatsinging” music videos, and the “Friends of Tuva” newsletters are online.Sadly, Feynman died in 1988, just weeks before receiving the coveted formal invitation that would allow us to set foot in Tuva at last. But his memory lives on, here and in the land of his dreams. Today, you can find an article online about “Feynman Rock” in Tuva, carved to commemorate the centenary of Feynman’s birth in May this year. At a related event in Kyzyl, Cowan gave a talk in Russian about the work that won Feynman the Nobel Prize, while a simultaneous commemoration live-streamed into Kyzyl from Caltech.",
            "Today I embark on dozens of quirky diversions every week, usually ending up happily lost in the world of Wikipedia (to which I contribute a dollar a day for my habit). But these easy jaunts seem more like sugar highs than the satisfying meal that Tuva provided, so in an effort to recapture that spirit of adventure, I’ve begun to frequent my local library and read good old-fashioned books again.Nevertheless, I'm thankful for the embarrassment of riches and fools gold that is today’s Internet. And on Google's 20th anniversary, I offer up a fervent hope: let us never stop pursuing the mysteries that surround us—wondrous mysteries that await sustained, serendipitous, and joyful investigation. Quests can still begin with an intriguing question; adventures still await the curious mind.Find your Tuva."

            "Robin Máxkii always felt caught between worlds—her reservation in Wisconsin, where she lived until age 11, and the urban sprawl of Houston, where she went to high school. During her late teens and early 20s, she maintained a blog, Native Notes, where she wrote passionately about native issues. One day, she received an anonymous comment that would change her life. It stated that if she wanted to actively change the community she wrote about, she should go to college. The seed was planted—she just needed to figure out how. Robin turned to Google Search and before she knew it, she found her place at a tribal college. There, she became a campus leader, and took internships that helped her advocate for greater access to tech for her community.Robin’s journey is the subject of our latest episode of “Search On,” Google’s original documentary series that tells the stories of people on a quest for better answers and the magic that happens when they find them at the intersection of tech and humanity. As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Google and Google Search, we couldn’t think of a story that better exemplifies the tremendous possibilities that come when people have access to information.

            "Last year at I/O, we announced a new job search experience so more people can find jobs that meet their needs. Since then, we’ve continued to improve and expand this experience. We’ve already helped connect over 100 million people in 92 countries to job listings, and we’re working to bring this feature to more countries by the end of the year.We’ve also focused on this unique challenge in individual communities. A few weeks ago, we shared our commitment to help our nation’s military service members transition to civilian jobs with job search for veterans, a tool for service members to easily find civilian jobs that use the skills and experience they developed in their military roles.But there’s more to be done. Forty percent of U.S. households struggle to afford ordinary expenses with their current income, while 46 percent of U.S. employers say they can't find employees with the skills they need. As industries change, a gap has formed in local communities: The skills in demand are not always the skills people have. And this gap is different in each community.  We see an opportunity for Search to help bridge this gap by connecting job seekers with effective, nearby job training programs delivering the skills local employers need. So that’s the challenge we’re working to solve now: to help people find useful information about the skills and training they need for a job, and better connect them with local resources that can help them realize those opportunities. Here’s one story that inspired us along the way:",
            "We want to help create more stories like Aaron’s for people everywhere and believe these opportunities should be more discoverable online. That’s why today we’re announcing a new feature within job search called Pathways—part of our Grow with Google initiative to ensure economic opportunity for everyone.Here’s our aspiration for how this will work: When someone searches for jobs on Google, we’ll show not only jobs available right now in their area, but also information about effective local training and education programs.  We’re starting a pilot of Pathways in Virginia, where we’re partnering with leading organizations in this ecosystem including the State of Virginia, the Virginia Community College System, local employers, and many others to make these local programs more discoverable through Search.We’re also piloting with Goodwill, the leading nonprofit job training provider in the U.S. As part of our Pathways initiative, volunteer Google engineers will work with local Goodwill organizations to ensure their education and training programs are easily found on the open web.What we learn from these pilots will help us develop new features and ensure information about programs are readily accessible to everyone in the U.S., and more countries in the future. We want to enable communities to thrive, and make transitions like Aaron’s possible everywhere.If your organization wants to collaborate and work together to bring this experience to life, join us."

            "Growing up in India, there was one good library in my town that I had access to—run by the British Council.  It was modest by western standards, and I had to take two buses just to get there. But I was lucky, because for every child like me, there were many more who didn’t have access to the same information that I did. Access to information changed my life, bringing me to the U.S. to study computer science and opening up huge possibilities for me that would not have been available without the education I had.",
            "When Google started 20 years ago, our mission was to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. That seemed like an incredibly ambitious mission at the time—even considering that in 1998 the web consisted of just 25 million pages (roughly the equivalent of books in a small library).Fast forward to today, and now we index hundreds of billions of pages in our index—more information than all the libraries in the world could hold. We’ve grown to serve people all over the world, offering Search in more than 150 languages and over 190 countries.Through all of this, we’ve remained grounded in our mission. In fact, providing greater access to information is as core to our work today as it was when we first started. And while almost everything has changed about technology and the information available to us, the core principles of Search have stayed the same.First and foremost, we focus on the user. Whether you’re looking for recipes, studying for an exam, or finding information on where to vote, we’re focused on serving your information needs.We strive to give you the most relevant, highest quality information as quickly as possible. This was true when Google started with the Page Rank algorithm—the foundational technology to Search. And it’s just as true today.We see billions of queries every day, and 15 percent of queries are ones we’ve never seen before. Given this scale, the only way to provide Search effectively is through an algorithmic approach. This helps us not just solve all the queries we’ve seen yesterday, but also all the ones we can’t anticipate for tomorrow. Finally, we rigorously test every change we make. A key part of this testing is the rater guidelines which define our goals in search, and which are publicly available for anyone to see. Every change to Search is evaluated by experimentation and by raters using these guidelines. Last year alone, we ran more than 200,000 experiments that resulted in 2,400+ changes to search. Search will serve you better today than it did yesterday, and even better tomorrow. As Google marks our 20th anniversary, I wanted to share a first look at the next chapter of Search, and how we’re working to make information more accessible and useful for people everywhere. This next chapter is driven by three fundamental shifts in how we think about Search:The shift from answers to journeys: To help you resume tasks where you left off and learn new interests and hobbies, we’re bringing new features to Search that help you with ongoing information needs.The shift from queries to providing a queryless way to get to information: We can surface relevant information related to your interests, even when you don’t have a specific query in mind.And the shift from text to a more visual way of finding information: We’re bringing more visual content to Search and completely redesigning Google Images to help you find information more easily.Underpinning each of these are our advancements in AI, improving our ability to understand language in ways that weren’t possible when Google first started. This is incredibly exciting, because over 20 years ago when I studied neural nets at school, they didn’t actually work very well...at all!But we’ve now reached the point where neural networks can help us take a major leap forward from understanding words to understanding concepts. Neural embeddings, an approach developed in the field of neural networks, allow us to transform words to fuzzier representations of the underlying concepts, and then match the concepts in the query with the concepts in the document. We call this technique neural matching. This can enable us to address queries like: “why does my TV look strange?” to surface the most relevant results for that question, even if the exact words aren’t contained in the page. (By the way, it turns out the reason is called the soap opera effect).Finding the right information about my TV is helpful in the moment. But AI can have much more profound effects. Whether it’s predicting areas that might be affected in a flood, or helping you identify the best job opportunities for you, AI can dramatically improve our ability to make information more accessible and useful.I’ve worked on Search at Google since the early days of its existence. One of the things that keeps me so inspired about Search all these years is our mission and how timeless it is. Providing greater access to information is fundamental to what we do, and there are always more ways we can help people access the information they need. That’s what pushes us forward to continue to make Search better for our users. And that’s why our work here is never done."

            "We’ve spent the last 20 years optimizing Search so it works really well for getting quick information. You ask what the capital of Costa Rica is, and we’ll tell you it’s San José. But in life we often take longer journeys, and people turn to Search for help in these moments too.Many searches are related to longer sessions that span multiple days, with people coming back to Search to find the latest updates on a topic or explore the range of content available. For example, you might be planning a trip, and searching for information about a destination over the course of a month. Or perhaps you regularly search for “easy dinner recipes” to help you plan you meals for the week.We can do better to help in these journeys, so today we’re sharing new features that help you resume tasks where you left off, keep track of ideas and content that you found useful, and get relevant suggestions of things to explore next. All of this marks a fundamental transformation in the way Search understands interests and longer journeys to help you find information.Retrace your steps with activity cardsRetracing your steps online can be really difficult. While we’ve always made your Search history available in your account settings, you should be able to access it when you’re searching, so it can be useful to you in the moment.Now, a new activity card will help you pick up from where you left off in Search. When you revisit a query related to a task you've started in the past, we’ll show you a card with relevant pages you’ve already visited and previous queries you’ve done on this topic. This helps you retrace your steps when you might not remember which sites had that useful information you’d found earlier.",
            "We’re intelligently showing this card only when it’s useful; it won’t appear for every search. And you’ll have full control over it—you can easily remove results from your history, pause seeing this card, or choose not to see it all together. This new activity card will be available in Search later this year.Keep track of your searches with CollectionsAnother way to more easily navigate long search journeys is by adding useful content to Collections. Collections in Search help you keep track of content you’ve visited, such as a website or article or image, and quickly get back to it later.Now, with an improved Collections experience, you can add your content from an activity card directly to Collections. This makes it even easier to keep track of and organize the content you want to revisit.",
            "We’ve also added content suggestions to help you explore topics further, based on the other content you’ve saved and things you’ve searched for. We’ll start rolling out this new Collections experience later this fall.Dynamic organization of Search resultsEvery search journey is different, and especially if you’re not familiar with the topic, it’s not always clear what your next search should be to help you learn more. So we’re introducing a new way of dynamically organizing search results that helps you more easily determine what information to explore next.Rather than presenting information within a set of predetermined categories, we can intelligently show the subtopics that are most relevant to what you’re searching for and make it easy to explore information from the web, all with a single search.So if you’re searching for Pugs, for example, you’ll now be able to see the tabs for the most common and relevant subtopics, like breed characteristics and names, right at the top. But if you search for something else, even a different kind of dog, like Yorkshire Terriers, you’ll see options grooming tips and breed history.",
            "The best part about this feature is that it continues to stay fresh and learns over time. As new information is published to the web, these tabs stay up to date to reflect what’s most relevant to that topic. This dynamic page organization is already live for a variety of topics, and we’ll expand to more in the future.A new Topic Layer in the Knowledge GraphTo enable all of these updates, Search has to understand interests and how they progress over time. So we’ve taken our existing Knowledge Graph—which understands connections between people, places, things and facts about them—and added a new layer, called the Topic Layer, engineered to deeply understand a topic space and how interests can develop over time as familiarity and expertise grow.The Topic Layer is built by analyzing all the content that exists on the web for a given topic and develops hundreds and thousands of subtopics. For these subtopics, we can identify the most relevant articles and videos—the ones that have shown themselves to be evergreen and continually useful, as well as fresh content on the topic. We then look at patterns to understand how these subtopics relate to each other, so we can more intelligently surface the type of content you might want to explore next.All of this enables experiences that make it easier than ever to explore your interests, even if you don’t have your next search in mind. We’re excited for the potential of this technology to provide more opportunities for discovery and exploration in Search."

            "For 20 years, Google Search has provided people with the information they need, and in times of crisis, access to timely, actionable information is often crucial. Last year we launched SOS Alerts on Search and Maps to make emergency information more accessible. Since then, we’ve activated SOS Alerts in more than 200 crisis situations, in addition to tens of thousands of Google Public Alerts, which have been viewed more than 1.5 billion times.Floods are devastating natural disasters worldwide—it’s estimated that every year, 250 million people around the world are affected by floods, also costing billions of dollars in damages. Flood forecasting can help individuals and authorities better prepare to keep people safe, but accurate forecasting isn’t currently available in many areas. And the warning systems that do exist can be imprecise and non-actionable, resulting in far too many people being underprepared and underinformed before a flood happens.To help improve awareness of impending floods, we're using AI and significant computational power to create better forecasting models that predict when and where floods will occur, and incorporating that information into Google Public Alerts. A variety of elements—from historical events, to river level readings, to the terrain and elevation of a specific area—feed into our models. From there, we generate maps and run up to hundreds of thousands of simulations in each location. With this information, we’ve created river flood forecasting models that can more accurately predict not only when and where a flood might occur, but the severity of the event as well.",
            "We started these flood forecasting efforts in India, where 20 percent of global flood-related fatalities occur. We’re partnering with India’s Central Water Commission to get the data we need to roll out early flood warnings, starting with the Patna region. The first alert went out earlier this month after heavy rains in the region.",
            "We’re also looking to expand coverage to more countries, to help more people around the world get access to these early warnings, and help keep them informed and safe."

            "When Search first began, our results were just plain text. But on February 24, 2000, something changed. It was the day after the Grammy Awards, and we noticed people were searching like crazy for Jennifer Lopez’s green dress. It was clear right away that people were looking for visual information, not just plain text. In the years that followed, the growth of mobile devices and small screens made it even more important to be able to quickly scan visual results.Since then, we’ve been working to include more imagery and videos in Search, whether it’s illustrated weather reports, live sports clips, or our visual recipe experience. We've been able to do this in part thanks to advancements in computer vision, which help us extract concepts from images. We model hundreds of millions of fine-grained concepts for every image and video that we have in our index. For example, an image of a tiger might generate concepts like “feline,” “animal” or “big cat.” This lets us identify a picture by looking at its pixels, without needing to be told by the words on a page.We’ve also made a number of updates to our most immersive experience for searching visual content, Google Images. These changes are aimed at helping people better find information visually, and making it easier to pursue the things people come to Google Images for help with, like shopping for products, styling a room, or tackling a DIY project.Today, we’re introducing three fundamental shifts in how we think about Search, including a range of new features that use AI to make your search experience more visual and enjoyable. And when you know you want to search visually, we’re making the Google Images experience even more useful and powerful. Immersive visual content with storiesEarlier this year we worked with the AMP Project to announce AMP stories, an open source library that makes it easy for anyone to create a story on the open web. While it’s still early, we’ve seen many publishers experimenting with this format and providing people with a more visual way to get information from Search and News. To help people discover these visual stories, we’ll also begin to show this content in Google Images and Discover.Now we’re beginning to use AI to intelligently construct AMP stories and surface this content in Search. We’re starting today with stories about notable people—like celebrities and athletes—providing a glimpse into facts and important moments from their lives in a rich, visual format. This format lets you easily tap to the articles for more information and provides a new way to discover content from the web.",
            "Visually preview topics with featured videos in SearchVideos can be a useful way to learn about a new topic, but it can be hard to find the most relevant videos to explore all the different facets of that topic space. Using computer vision, we’re now able to deeply understand the content of a video and help you quickly find the most useful information in a new experience called featured videos.Imagine you’re planning a hiking trip to Zion National Park, and you want to check out videos of what to expect and ideas for sites to visit. Since you’ve never been there, you might not know which specific landmarks to look for when mapping out your trek.With featured videos, we take our deep understanding of the topic space (in this case, the most important landmarks in the park) and show the most relevant videos for those subtopics. For Zion National Park, you might see a video for each attraction, like Angels Landing or the Narrows. This provides a more holistic view of the video content available for a topic, and opens up new paths to discover more.",
            "Visual journeys with Google ImagesPeople coming to Google Images today are looking to find information, or for help doing something—not just to see an image. So we’re announcing several new features to help you find visual information more easily, and pursue activities where having a visual reference is important.Tapping the power of the web pageWhen you come to Google Images for help on a task, the page where an image lives is important. Whatever page you visit should help you take the next step in what you’re trying to do. Also, with many visual searches, there may not be one right answer, so you want to scan a lot of images and information before you find what you need.Over the last year, we’ve overhauled the Google Images algorithm to rank results that have both great images and great content on the page. For starters, the authority of a web page is now a more important signal in the ranking. If you’re doing a search for DIY shelving, the site behind the image is now more likely to be a site related to DIY projects. We also prioritize fresher content, so you’re more likely to visit a site that has been updated recently.Also, it wasn’t long ago that if you visited an image’s web page, it might be hard to find the specific image you were looking for when you got there. We now prioritize sites where the image is central to the page, and higher up on the page. So if you’re looking to buy a specific pair of shoes, a product page dedicated to that pair of shoes will be prioritized above, say, a category page showing a range of shoe styles.  Starting this week, we’ll also show more context around images, including captions that show you the title of the webpage where each image is published. This is critical to help you understand the page behind the image. We’ll also suggest related search terms at the top of the page for more guidance. We’ve already introduced this new look on mobile, and now we’re bringing it to desktop where a larger screen is important for complex tasks.",
            "Explore within an image using AI with Lens in Google ImagesWe launched Google Lens last year to help you do more with what you see. People are already using it in their camera and on their photos—to find items in an outfit they like, learn more about landmarks, or identify that cute dog in the park. In the coming weeks, we’ll bring Lens to Google Images to help you explore and learn more about visual content you find during your searches.",
            "Lens’ AI technology analyzes images and detects objects of interest within them. If you select one of these objects, Lens will show you relevant images, many of which link to product pages so you can continue your search or buy the item you’re interested in. Using your finger on a mobile device screen, Lens will also let you “draw” on any part of an image, even if it’s not preselected by Lens, to trigger related results and dive even deeper on what’s in your image.We hope these changes will make it easier—and more visually interesting—to traverse the web, find information, and pursue your interests."

Suddenly, a travel article published three months ago is timely for you. This can also be useful as you’re taking up a new hobby or going deeper on a long-time interest. Using the Topic Layer in the Knowledge Graph, Discover can predict your level of expertise on a topic and help you further develop those interests. If you’re learning to play guitar, for example, you might see beginner content about learning chords. If you’re already a skilled musician, you may see a video on more advanced techniques.Discover is unique because it's one step ahead: it helps you come across the things you haven't even started looking for.",

Discover uses the same technology as Full Coverage in Google News to bring you a variety of perspectives on the latest news.Discover in multiple languagesWith this redesign, Discover will now be even more useful to people who speak multiple languages. You may like to use recipes in Spanish and read sports in English, and you will see content in your language of preference for each interest.",

            "I’m one of those people who always cuts it close at the airport—it’s a race through security, with just enough time to grab the airline essentials: water bottle, magazine, a soft pretzel if I’m lucky. But I just learned that I can whip out Google Maps to find my way around the airport (by searching the airport name and terminal number), so I no longer waste time running around looking for my snack of choice.For two decades, Google has built products that make my life more useful. Eight of these products now have a billion users, and with all that extra time at the airport, I got to thinking—how many other unknown tips and tricks are out there? Since Google is celebrating its 20th birthday this month, I present a party favor: tips on Google’s most-used products, straight from the people who helped build them. SearchFor lovers of covers: Try searching for a song and then tapping “other recordings” for different renditions.Don’t burn daylight: Make the most of your daylight hours by knowing when the sun will go down. Search [sunset] to get the time the sun will set today.For content connoisseurs: If you’re a fan of bingeable TV shows or a movie buff, you can see all the places to stream any show or film by searching [watch] followed by the title. (Head’s up: this is available in the U.S., Great Britain, Australia, Germany and India). Emily Moxley, Director of Product ManagementMapsBeat the crowds: Use Google Maps to find out the estimated wait times and popular times to visit your favorite restaurants and businesses. Don’t get lost in the parking lot: If you’ve ever spent way too long searching for your parked car, this tip’s for you. After navigating to your destination, tap on the blue dot and then “Set as parking location” so you can always find your way back to your parking spot.Quickest route to the airport snacks: If you’re flying to a new place, you can use Google Maps to help you find your way around an airport. A quick search for an airport terminal name, say “SFO Terminal 1,” will show you the lay of the land, including nearby gates, lounges, restaurants and stores.Dane Glasgow, VP of ProductYouTubeJust add popcorn: Developed to cut down on glare and give you that movie theater experience, Dark Theme turns your background dark while you’re watching YouTube. It’s available on desktop, iOS and now rolling out to Android. Pick your pace: Speed up or slow down the playback of a video by tapping on the three dots at the bottom right of any video. Take a shortcut: While watching a YouTube video, use the numbered keys to seek in a video. For example, hitting “2” will take you 20 percent into the video, “6” will take you to 60 percent into the video, “0” will restart the video. Brian Marquardt, Director of Product ManagementGmailThe ultimate to-do list: Open Tasks in your side panel within Gmail, then drag and drop emails to turn your messages into action items. Shhhh: Declutter your inbox with Gmail’s mute feature, which pushes the entire conversation to your archive and any future conversations on the thread bypass your inbox to be automatically archived as well. Take it back: Don’t fret over embarrassing typos, unintentional reply-alls, or other email taboos. In your Gmail settings, just implement a 5-30 second cancellation period on your sent emails and once you’ve fired one off, you’ll receive a prompt to “Undo.”Kevin Smilak, Engineering DirectorGoogle DriveGive your docs a gold star: Find your favorite Drive items by starring your most important docs within the Drive main menu, and then bookmarking your Starred page. File_name_V2: Freeze moments in time by naming different versions of the docs you edit frequently. In a Doc, Sheet, or Slides go to File > Version History > Name current version. Name any version then access it easily from \"Version history\" by name. Your search is our command: Google Drive makes the text within all of the images and PDFs you upload searchable. Try searching for a phrase that you know is inside a picture or PDF, which is especially helpful when you can’t remember your filename. Alexander Vogenthaler, Director of Product ManagementAndroidLost and found: If you’ve misplaced your Android phone, Find My Device lets you locate it by signing into your Google account. Or you can call it directly from a browser by typing “find my device” on Google. Lock your phone remotely or display a message on the lock screen, so if someone finds it they know who to contact. If you’re convinced it’s lost for good, you can erase all your data.Always reachable: Don’t miss any urgent phone calls and messages from important contacts like close family members or your child’s school, even when you have Do Not Disturb turned on. Just add a star to people that matter to you, and then allow calls and messages from “starred contacts only” in Do Not Disturb settings. Use your voice: You can ask your Google Assistant to handle tasks on your Android phone (running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or later). Start by saying “OK Google,” then try “take a screenshot,” “turn on flashlight,” or “open WiFi setting.” You can even ask to “take a selfie”—this will open the camera app and start a countdown. Cheeeeeeeese. Sagar Kamdar, Director of Product ManagementGoogle PlayWhen you’re good with faces, but not names: Just hit pause on your movie, tap the circle around the actor or actress's face, and learn more about them and what other movies they’ve been in.Read like a superhero: When you’re reading a comic on your phone, tap on a voice bubble and use your volume buttons to zoom in on the dialogue between two characters.What you wish for: You can create a wishlist to keep track of items you want to install or purchase on Google Play.Kara Bailey, Global Merchandising DirectorChromeAccess history across devices: Open Chrome and click on “History.” From the drop down menu, click “Full History” and “Tabs From Other Devices.” If you’re signed into the same Google account on both your phone and your computer, you’ll see the article you were just about to finish on your way into work.Keeping tabs on your tabs: You can save eight days of time per year using keyboard shortcuts.

            "Search has been helping you settle bets since 1998 (turns out there is some caffeine in decaf coffee), but now that we’re 20 years in, we’ve built dozens of other useful features and tools to help you get through your day. Let’s jump into some of these secret (and not-so-secret) tricks to up your Search game.Search as your everyday sidekickHere are some of the ways you can plan your day and stay in the know with Search.1. Fill your schedule with nearby events: With your phone, simply search for [events near me] or for a specific event type like [food festivals] and you’ll see listings for local activities from around the web. With a recent update, you can also browse events based on your interests. 2. Movie showtimes and tickets: When you’re in the mood for a movie, Search brings together showtimes, theater locations, and ratings all in one place. It makes it easy to decide which movie and location work best for you (and then to buy your tickets in advance). 3. Recipe Search: If you’re looking for a recipe in a pinch, just search on mobile for whatever you’re craving (say, chicken parmesan) and you’ll see a carousel of recipe suggestions.4. Live sports scores: Search makes it easy to stay up on the latest scores, whether you’re a fervent fantasy sports aficionado or a casual fan. Type in the name of your favorite team or league (like the NFL), and get real-time scores and recaps from recent games.5. Styling and shopping help from Google Images: When you're exploring style ideas or browsing for your next buy with Google Images, pictures of products that are available to purchase are marked with a \"products\" badge in the Google app and mobile web. Images marked “product” include price, reviews and availability, making it easier and faster to research and shop.",
            "Helping you navigate important decisionsWhen you’re looking for information related to your career, education or health, we provide quick access to tools and reliable resources to help you make informed decisions.6. Find your next job: Now available in more than 90 countries around the world, you can search for jobs right on Google. Try searching for [jobs near me] or [retail jobs] to explore jobs from across the web. You can also save jobs set up alerts, map your potential commute and click through to apply.7. Discover the right college for you: Right on Search, you can find more information about four-year U.S. colleges, including information about admissions, cost and student life. You can dig into data around graduation rates and typical annual income 10 years after enrollment.8. Help with health questions: When searching for common health conditions, like influenza or a sprained ankle, you’ll find relevant medical facts in a knowledge panel. We’ll show you typical symptoms, treatments and other details—like how common the condition is, whether it’s critical or contagious, ages of people affected and more—all from reliable sources and vetted by doctors. If you search for clinical depression on your mobile device, we’ll also provide easy access to a clinically validated private screening test, the results of which can be helpful in conversations with your own care provider.",
            "Time-saving toolsWhen you need a quick answer to help you with daily tasks, we provide tools right in Search to help you on your way:9. Figure out who owes what: You can use Google to calculate your tip when you’re in a restaurant. Simply search for [tip calculator], enter the cost of your meal, and the percentage you want to tip. You can even ask Google to help you split the bill evenly with your friends.10. Convert cash: If you’re heading out on a trip, here’s a tool that makes a ton of cents: you can get real-time currency conversions right on Google. Search for something like [$500 in Euros] and you’ll get a box with the current exchange rate and an interactive graph to let you explore the change over time.11. Track packages: You can enter any UPS, USPS, or Fedex tracking number directly into the Google search bar, and it’ll show you the tracking information about your package.12. Quick access to appointments, flights and more: If you don’t want to toggle through your tabs, Search can help you find information about your upcoming plans. If you’re logged into your Google account, searching for “my trips” or “my appointments” will show you (and only you!) relevant results about upcoming flights, hotel reservations and your schedule from Gmail and Google Calendar.13. Get the numbers about your noms: You can search for nutritional information and find out the number of calories in your everyday foods. For example, you can ask “how much fat is there in chocolate cake?” or “how much sugar is there in tomato sauce?” and Google will break down the nutritional stats for you.14. Definitions and synonyms: You can use Google as a dictionary and thesaurus. Try searching for [what does loquacious mean] and you might find yourself talking nonstop about this feature.",
            "For the savvy searchersWhen you’re asking a complicated question or hoping to dig deep on a topic, Search can be your co-researcher.15. Ask complex multi-part questions: You can ask Google “compositional queries” that require us to solve the first piece of the question before addressing the second part. For example, if you search [when were the members of NSYNC born], you will (feel old and) see the birthdates of Justin, JC, Chris, Lance and Joey.16. Search with an image: On your computer, upload your own photo to Google Images to find the same or similar photos on the web. Click on the camera icon in Google Images and Google will also tell you the origin and other details about the photo. Now you can know where that meme really came from.17. Check how to say massive numbers correctly: Type in any long number and add “=english” to the end of your search and you’ll find the correct way to spell out the number in words. Try it for 6006131520 (hint: it’s not “Google is 20”).18. Search within a time period: You can narrow your search to a specific date range and see only content published during that time. This can be useful if you’re looking for insight into how a news topic may have been covered at a certain point in time or looking for resources for a history paper, perhaps.19. Search within a site: If you’re looking for an article or page from a specific publisher, Search will let you focus your results on that single website. Just add “site:” ahead of the web URL to limit your results to that publisher, and you can then sort by recency or add additional keywords to narrow down your search.20. Advanced Search: If all of these tricks still don’t get you what you need, you can use Advanced Search to apply a number of filters, like specifying terms you want to exclude or only find pages that are in certain languages, regions, sites or file formats.",
            "But right now, I’m not feeling that advanced—so will go back to searching for cake recipes for Google’s birthday."

            "In today's world, scientists in many disciplines and a growing number of journalists live and breathe data. There are many thousands of data repositories on the web, providing access to millions of datasets; and local and national governments around the world publish their data as well. To enable easy access to this data, we launched Dataset Search, so that scientists, data journalists, data geeks, or anyone else can find the data required for their work and their stories, or simply to satisfy their intellectual curiosity.",
            "Similar to how Google Scholar works, Dataset Search lets you find datasets wherever they’re hosted, whether it’s a publisher's site, a digital library, or an author's personal web page. To create Dataset search, we developed guidelines for dataset providers to describe their data in a way that Google (and other search engines) can better understand the content of their pages. These guidelines include  salient information about datasets: who created the dataset, when it was published, how the data was collected, what the terms are for using the data, etc. We then collect and link this information, analyze where different versions of the same dataset might be, and find publications that may be describing or discussing the dataset. Our approach is based on an open standard for describing this information (schema.org) and anybody who publishes data can describe their dataset this way. We encourage dataset providers, large and small, to adopt this common standard so that all datasets are part of this robust ecosystem.In this new release, you can find references to most datasets in environmental and social sciences, as well as data from other disciplines including government data and data provided by news organizations, such as ProPublica. As more data repositories use the schema.org standard to describe their datasets, the variety and coverage of datasets that users will find in Dataset Search, will continue to grow.Dataset Search works in multiple languages with support for additional languages coming soon. Simply enter what you are looking for and we will help guide you to the published dataset on the repository provider’s site.For example, if you wanted to analyze daily weather records, you might try this query in Dataset Search:",
            "You’ll see data from NASA and NOAA, as well as from academic repositories such as Harvard's Dataverse and Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). Ed Kearns, Chief Data Officer at NOAA, is a strong supporter of this project and helped NOAA make many of their datasets searchable in this tool. “This type of search has long been the dream for many researchers in the open data and science communities” he said. “And for NOAA, whose mission includes the sharing of our data with others, this tool is key to making our data more accessible to an even wider community of users.”This launch is one of a series of initiatives to bring datasets more prominently into our products. We recently made it easier to discover tabular data in Search, which uses this same metadata along with the linked tabular data to provide answers to queries directly in search results. While that initiative focused more on news organizations and data journalists, Dataset search can be useful to a much broader audience, whether you're looking for scientific data, government data, or data provided by news organizations.A search tool like this one is only as good as the metadata that data publishers are willing to provide. We hope to see many of you use the open standards to describe your data, enabling our users to find the data that they are looking for. If you publish data and don't see it in the results, visit our instructions on our developers site which also includes a link to ask questions and provide feedback."

            "This year marks the 50th anniversary of the National Trail System, which oversees more than 50,000 miles of trails across the U.S., and makes sure historic sites like the Pacific Crest Trail are around for years to come. One of the most magical parts of traipsing around the wilderness is the chance to see local fauna: catching a glimpse of a hawk circling a field, floating by a beaver dam on your kayak, or spotting a baby deer in your hometown park. You can use Google Images to learn more about the wildlife you encounter while hiking: to find out if what you just saw was *really* a coyote, or if that spider whose web you demolished is as scary as it looks. Over the past year, Google image searches for animals have approximately doubled.We took a look at Google Images trends to find some of the most uniquely searched animals (and bugs!) in each U.S. state. Take a look to find out where you should travel to spy an orca whale, and where to *avoid* if you never want to see a leopard shark in real life.For those of you planning last-minute nature exploration this summer, we’ve also identified some of the top spots in the U.S. to get your eyes on some wild creatures.",
            "Animal aficionados won’t be surprised that more people are searching for Orcas in Washington, or gila monsters in Arizona. But porcupines in Nebraska, or wolverines in Minnesota? Perhaps not as obvious. If bugs are your bag, image searches indicate you’re likely to see a butterfly in Hawaii, or black widows (eep) in Colorado. If you’re visiting Iowa, keep your eyes peeled for the elegant, yet still sort of creepy, praying mantis. Check out the complete lists of uniquely searched animals and bugs in each U.S. state.So where can you go to explore the great outdoors, and maybe catch a glimpse of lions, tigers and bears (oh my)? The top ten trending hikes on Google Maps include the world-famous Appalachian trail, the longest hiking-only trail in America, and the scenic Monument Valley desert, known for its epic rock buttes, plus several other trails across the country.",
            "If you’re willing to spend the night in nature, the top ten trending campgrounds include Mackinaw Mill Creek in Michigan, which lets you set up camp on the shores of one of the Great Lakes. South Carlsbad State Beach in Southern California is set on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a short distance from water sports, and maybe some sea life. Just keep an eye out for leopard sharks ;). Pro tip: Wondering what type of wildflowers you’re seeing on the trail, or if that green bush you hiked through was poison oak? Use Google Lens to help you identify local plant life (or wildlife, if you can catch it standing still … ). Just open the Lens app, point your camera at the plant and Lens will help you identify what you’re looking at.Now that you're fully informed on how Google can help you learn more about the wildlife around you, get out there and see it for yourself!"

            "Like anyone who has searched for a job at some point in their lives, I know from experience how hard it can be to find the right role. You can spend days scouring job postings that are scattered across the web, flicking through newspapers or dropping into local employers, yet still struggle to find a job that suits you. Employers may be feeling the impact of this too: three quarters of U.K. employers face talent shortages and have issues filling open positions with the right candidate.Today, more people are turning to Google to find information about their next role. We have a long history of using our technology to connect people with information, so we’re excited to bring a new job search experience to Google to connect people in the U.K. to job opportunities. This new feature in Search lets you more easily explore jobs from across the web and find job postings that suit your needs and skills. Starting today, when you search for “jobs near me,” “teaching jobs,” or similar queries in English in the U.K., you’ll have the option to click through to a feature that lets you explore jobs from across the web that meet your unique needs. You can access salary information, reviews and ratings of the employer and different options to apply for a job, or use a location filter to see jobs in the areas that are convenient for you. Thanks to Google Maps, if you’re signed in, you’ll even be able to see how long it would take to commute to a job from your home. Searching for a job can take time, and keeping up with new jobs that are posted throughout the day can be impossible. Now in Google Search you can save individual jobs with a single tap so that they are accessible across any of your devices. And if you step away from your job search, you can stay in the loop on opportunities that interest you by turning on alerts to receive an email notification whenever new jobs arrive.",
            "The new jobs experience in Search is the result of deep collaboration with the job-matching industry, and benefits both employers and job seekers. We first introduced this experience in the U.S. last year, and it’s now live in several countries. Since launching it, we’ve seen 130 percent more companies showing jobs in Search and connected tens of millions of people around the world to new job opportunities.In the U.K., we’re working with organizations from across the job-matching industry to bring you the most comprehensive listing of jobs, like The Guardian Jobs, Reed.co.uk, Haymarket, Gumtree, The Telegraph, Reach plc's totallylegal, CV-Library and totaljobs.com. This means anyone searching for jobs on Google will see postings from these sites and many others from across the web as soon as they’re posted. To ensure even more jobs are listed over time, we’re publishing open documentation for all jobs providers detailing how to make their job openings discoverable in this new feature.This launch also builds on the commitment we made last year to help 100,000 people in the U.K. find a job or grow in their career by 2020. We’re doing that through our Google Digital Garage program, which gives anyone free training in digital skills and products to help grow their career, business or confidence. So far we’ve helped tens of thousands of people find their next job through free training at four city-center hubs and with partners across the U.K.Whether you’re a recent graduate looking for your first job, a parent supporting a growing family, or simply hunting for your dream role, we hope this new experience on Google will help make the job search simpler and connect you with your next job."

        "Publish Date": "Jul 11, 2018",
        "article_paragraphs": [
            "Earlier this year, we partnered with developer Tania Finlayson, an expert in Morse code assistive technology, to make Morse code more accessible. Today, we’re rolling out Morse code on Gboard for iOS and improvements to Morse code on Gboard for Android. To help you learn how to type in Morse code, we’ve created a game (on Android, iOS, and desktop) that can help you learn it in less than an hour! We’ve worked closely with Tania on these updates to the keyboard and more—here, she explains how Morse code changed her life:My name is Tania Finlayson, and I was born with cerebral palsy. A few doctors told my parents that I probably would not amount to anything, and suggested my parents put me in an institution. Luckily, my parents did not take the advice, raised me like a normal child, and did not expect any less of me throughout my childhood. I had to eat my dinner first before I could have desserts, I had to go to bed at bedtime, and I got in trouble when I picked on my older brother.The only difference was that I was not able to communicate very effectively; basically, I could only answer “yes” and “no” questions. When I was old enough to read, I used a communication word board with about 200 words on it. I used a head stick to point to the words. A couple of years later, my dad decided that I should try a typewriter and press the keys with the head stick. Amazingly, my vocabulary grew. My mom did not dress me in plaid any more, I could tell on my brother, and I finally had the chance to annoy my Dad with question after question about the world. I am quite sure that my Dad did not, in any way, regret letting me try a typewriter. Ha!Several years later, I was one of four kids chosen to participate in a study for non-verbal children at the University of Washington. The study was led by Al Ross, who wrote a grant funding the creation of a Morse code communicator for disabled children. Morse code, which is a communication system that dates back to the 1800s, allowed us to spell out words and communicate just by using two buttons: a dot “.” and a dash “—”.",
            "The device was revolutionary.  It would convert my Morse code into letters then speak out loud in English and had a small printer installed in it.  I could activate a light to “raise my hand in class.” At first I thought learning Morse code would be a waste of time, but soon learned that it gave me total freedom with my words, and for the first time, I could talk with ease, without breaking my neck. School became fun, instead of exhausting. I could focus on my studies, and have real conversations with my friends for the first time. Also, I did not need an adult figure with me every moment at school, and that was awesome.My experience with the Morse code communicator led me to a partnership with Google on bringing Morse code to Gboard. Working closely with the team, I helped design the keyboard layout, added Morse sequences to the auto-suggestion strip above the keyboard, and developed settings that allow people to customize the keyboard to their unique needs. The Morse code keyboard on Gboard allows people to use Morse code (dots and dashes) to enter text, instead of the regular (QWERTY) keyboard. Gboard for Android lets you hook external switches to the device (check out the source code my husband Ken and I developed), so a person with limited mobility could operate the device.",
            "I’m excited to see what people will build that integrates with Morse code—whether it’s a keyboard like Gboard, a game, or educational app, the possibilities are endless. Most technology today is designed for the mass market. Unfortunately, this can mean that people with disabilities can be left behind. Developing communication tools like this is important, because for many people, it simply makes life livable. Now, if anyone wants to try Morse code, they can use the phone in their pocket. Just by downloading an app, anyone anywhere can give communicating with Morse code a try.When I was first able to communicate as a child, the first feeling that I had was “Wow! This is pretty far out!” The first thing I typed was “You’re an old fart, Dad!” That was the first time I saw him laugh with tears in his eyes; I still don’t know if I made him really laugh or if I made him really sad! Probably a little of both."

            "Each week, we take a look at the top trending topics in Search for a sense of what the world is thinking about. Here’s a look at a few of the trending searches this week—some playful and some serious—with data from the Google News Lab. [Insert header pun here … punalty intended]This week, fans around the world put the Gooooooooooogle in goooooooooooal!, making the World Cup the single biggest topic in Search. Everybody loves a home team, but it’s Brazil that’s leading searches globally. Meh about the players but love the game? Get in on the action with “Drills and skills” videos on YouTube; their views have increased six times since the last FIFA World Cup. And you can keep track of all your favorite teams and players with Google Trends.The best part of the world’s best lasagnaAmid searches for “best in the world,” the top contenders were “best soccer player in the world” (because World Cup, see above) and “best restaurants in the world,” since the list of top 50 restaurants in the world was released this week. Topping the list is an Italian eatery whose menu listings include “an eel swimming up the Po river” and “the crunchy part of the lasagna.” Clearly they’re onto something ... the top searched “world’s best” food is lasagna, which maybe you’d pair with the next item on the list, “world’s best beer.”The sun never sets on party ideasIf you found that beer, hopefully you sipped it on it yesterday—it was summer solstice, the longest day of the year. And if that lager rendered you pensive, you may have joined those who wondered, “what is the summer solstice?” and, soberly, “when does summer end?” Perk up while the sun’s up: “summer solstice party ideas” was the top related query to the phenomenon, and no place searched for the solstice more than the U.K., where nearly 10,000 people gathered to celebrate at Stonehenge.Summer solstice playlistQueen Bey and the queen’s consort Jay-Z reign again, dropping a surprise album, “Everything Is Love,” last weekend. Search interest went up for both Bey and Jay in the U.S., 92 percent and 130 percent respectively, but Beyoncé was searched more than Jay-Z in every U.S. state. Jay-Z’s streaming platform Tidal also got its own wave of searches: interest in Tidal spiked 267 percent in the past week. The album release included a masterpiece of a music video at the Louvre, prompting people to search “How much does it cost to rent out the Louvre?” and “Where is the Mona Lisa?”Crisis at the borderOn a more serious note, the world turned its attention to the U.S.-Mexico border this week, as anger erupted over immigrant children being separated from their families and held at migrant detention centers. A viral photo of a young girl caused a 3000 percent spike in searches for “crying toddler at border.” Searches for the Secretary of Homeland Security spiked by over 5000 percent, as did searches for former First Lady Laura Bush, who spoke out against the separation. The top “how to help” questions this week were “How to help immigrant children?” and “How to help families separated at the border?” as people searched for ways to contribute."

            "Ten years ago, for the very first Doodle 4 Google contest, we asked students “what if?” A decade later, we’ve been privileged to receive hundreds of thousands of submissions for our annual contest—submissions that reflect the dreams, hopes and talents of students across the country. These young artists help us to see the world through their eyes and find inspiration in unexpected places. This year was no exception. We asked students to respond to the theme “What Inspires Me…” and received doodles depicting everything from a love of family and food to a passion for intergalactic roller coasters (!). Now we’re thrilled to announce the winner of the 2018 Doodle 4 Google contest: first grader Sarah Gomez-Lane, who drew delightful dinosaurs to highlight her dream of becoming a paleontologist. Sarah was our K-3 finalist, and the Virginia state winner. We fell in love with Sarah’s rendering of her dinos, and were blown away by her big (you might even say “dino-sized”!) ambitions for her future, especially at her young age. When asked how she felt upon hearing she was a finalist, Sarah exclaimed that she was “surprised!” Her advice to students interested in submitting to future Doodle 4 Google contests? “Try your best and have fun!”",
            "For the first time in Doodle 4 Google’s 10-year history, the National Winner will have the opportunity to turn their submission into an animated, interactive Doodle featured on the Google homepage. Over the summer, Sarah will collaborate with the Doodle team to bring her artwork to life. She’ll also receive $30,000 toward a college scholarship, and her elementary school in Falls Church, VA, will receive $50,000 to spend on technology to help students like Sarah continue to pursue what inspires them.Thank you to everyone who participated not only this year, but throughout the past decade. And, of course, a huge congratulations to all of the talented 2018 winners. From all of us at Google: keep dreaming—and keep doodling!"

We work hard to ensure that search spam doesn’t get in the way of you finding the information you’re looking for.You can get a sense of how search could be ruined by search spam by visiting the spam folder in your Gmail account. Just as Gmail fights email spam and keeps it out of your inbox, our search spam fighting systems work to keep your search results clean.Okay, so what is spam?Search spam comes in a variety of different forms. We refer to a page or site as “spammy” if it is trying to fool or manipulate our ranking systems. Some spam comes from site owners who are intentionally trying to secure higher search rankings using techniques that go against our guidelines. While search spam is designed impact search ranking, some spammy pages may also be harmful to users, trying to trick you into providing your personal or financial information or subscribing to a service with unclear terms.In more serious cases, spammy webpages are on websites that may unknowingly have been victims of hacking. Hacked websites can create serious threats to users: once controlled by hacker, a site can become a channel for distributing malware or causing further damage, while also taking advantage of the legitimate website owner.That doesn’t sound good. What are you doing about it?We have systems in place to detect and prevent search spam, but we also work actively with site owners to maintain a healthy web. We provide guidelines for webmasters, encouraging them to produce high-quality content and services. In 2017, we conducted 250+ webmaster meetups and office hours around the world reaching more than 220,000 website owners. Through our support forum we answered thousands of questions each month, and through Search Console we sent over 45 million notifications to registered website owners alerting them to possible problems with their websites which could affect their appearance in search. While most spam detection is done automatically, when spam slips through, we take manual action. Last year, we sent 6 million manual action messages to webmasters about practices we identified that were against our guidelines, along with information on how to resolve the issue.Last year, we focused a great deal of effort on reducing the impact on users from hacked websites, and were able to detect and remove more than 80 percent of compromised sites from search results. We’re also working closely with many providers of popular content management systems like WordPress and Joomla to help them fight spammers that abuse forums and comment sections. What can I do?Our automated systems are constantly working to detect and block spam. Still, we always welcome hearing from you when something seems … phishy. Last year, we were able to take action on nearly 90,000 user reports of search spam.Reporting spam, malware and other issues you find helps us protect the site owner and other searchers from this abuse. You can file a spam report, a phishing report or a malware report. You can also alert us to any issue with Google search by clicking on the “Send feedback” link at the bottom of the search results page, which will trigger this reporting tool:",

Known for her bright colors and encouraging words, people searched for quotes by the designer: “Kate Spade she’s a dreamer, doer, thinker quote” and “Kate Spade she is quick, curious, playful and strong.” And remembered for his taste for the unknown, people looked for: “Anthony Bourdain quotes on life” and “Anthony Bourdain quotes food.”We’ve also seen a large increase in searches related to suicide prevention, like “how to help someone who is depressed.” On Search, we have systems in place to help people find information from trusted organizations, such as national hotlines, that can provide help and support for those who may need it."

In that spirit, we're planning features on Search that will allow Brazilians to stay up to speed on key dates, the candidates and other critical information about the election. We're also adding the option for presidential candidates to post statements directly on Google about where they stand on key issues. And on election day, you'll be able to keep track of the results on Search.When the campaign kicks off in August, we'll roll out a Google Trends hub for Brazil that offers an overview of the race through the lens of Search. The hub will be a one-stop shop for data about search interest in candidates and their parties, the most searched questions and other related queries, all in real time.",
            "More local Actions on the AssistantWe launched the Google Assistant in Brazilian Portuguese less than a year ago, and Brazil is now among the top three countries in daily active users. Portuguese is also the second most popular language for Assistant usage on smartphones. Brazilians already use the Assistant to send WhatsApp messages, play music on Spotify, and watch videos on YouTube or Netflix. Now we’re working with more than 30 local partners to bring more Actions to the Assistant. In the next few months, Brazilians will be able to order a pizza with iFood, book a table with Restorando, hail a ride with 99 and do much more by using nothing but their voice.Enhancing Maps for BraziliansA new feature on Maps will help Brazilians navigate a São Paulo law that restricts motorists from driving in designated parts of the city during peak traffic hours one day a week. All they need to do is give the last number of their license plate and Maps will provide customized directions to avoid restricted areas. We’ve also more than doubled the number of Brazilian cities on Maps with real-time transit information, to 15 from six. The list now includes cities like Campinas, Caxias do Sul, Uberaba and Campina Grande.",

            "Technology can also play a key role in helping to reduce gender inequality. That’s the thinking behind Womenwill, which aims to create economic opportunities for women. We brought Womenwill to Brazil in March, and since then more than 2,500 women have undergone training in leadership, negotiation techniques, personal finance and digital marketing. While that's a promising start, there is much more to do. Today we announced a Google.org grant of $1 million for Instituto Rede Mulher Empreendedora, a Brazilian nonprofit that promotes and supports entrepreneurship among women. The grant will help them train up to 135,000 women in Brazil over the next two years.We hope that each of the announcements we made today will have an impact on people's lives in one way or another. And we remain committed to bringing the transformational power of technology to people everywhere."

            "A network pulled the plug on an iconic sitcom, the nation’s best tiny spellers and NBA conference champs prepared to step into the spotlight—and people turned to Search to keep up with the buzz. Here’s a look at this week’s top trends, with data from Google News Lab. Deja hoopGame 1 of the NBA Finals kicked off this week and yes, we’re in for another Golden State Warriors- Cleveland Cavaliers series matchup. LeBron James and Stephen Curry reign supreme as the top searched players this week—surprise, surprise—while Ohio beat out California as the region with the most searches for “the NBA Finals.” We’ll have to wait and see who walks away with the Larry O’Brien trophy, but this group has already made history by becoming the only two teams to face off in the Finals four years in a row. Catsuit got your tongue Serena Williams stunned fans when she announced she was pregnant during her 2017 Australian Open sweep. The powerhouse athlete is in the limelight again this week, this time serving some major style. She claimed victory during her Tuesday match at the French Open sporting an all-black Nike catsuit that sent the Internet into a frenzy. Search interest in “Serena Williams black cat suit” spiked over 4,600 percent with “What is Serena wearing” coming in as the top trending question. That’s what I call the cat’s meow! Barred from ABC ABC canceled \"Roseanne\" on Tuesday after the show's biggest star, Roseanne Barr, sent out a racist tweet. “What did Rosanne tweet” and “Why is Rosanne cancelled\" quickly rose to the top of Search. Folks across Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana were particularly interested in “Roseanne” (the TV show) while others in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland were more intrigued by “Roseanne Barr” (the actress). Washington, DC was pretty curious about both—go figure! Can you use it in a sentence? Karthik Nemmani can! Forty-one of the nation’s best spellers competed for the coveted top spot in this year’s National Scripps Spelling Bee. Karthik, the soft-spoken eighth-grader from Texas, won it all with the proper spelling of “koinonia.” The Greek-derived word spiked by over 3,500 percent in the last 24 hours—\"koinonia meaning\" and \"koinonia pronunciation\" were the top related search terms. (According to Google, it’s “Christian fellowship or communion, with God or, more commonly, with fellow Christians.”) “Beautiful,” “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” and “resume” came in as some of the most searched “how to spell” words across the country. Murph, muscle and might What do you get when you combine two miles, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups and 300 squats? The Murph. If you’re still asking “What Is The Murph?” and “What is The Murph competition named after?” you’re not alone. These were among the top trending questions about the exercise phenomenon in the U.S. this week. “Murph” is a CrossFit workout that pays tribute to Navy Lieutenant Michael Murphy, who was killed in the line of duty back in 2005. But the real question is: “How long will I be sore from the Murph workout?”"

            "A High Five on the 25th day of the 5th month feels like it should mean something, but it doesn’t. Much like most of the internet. What does mean something is this beautiful long weekend we’ve got ahead of us, so, without further ado: I bring you this week’s top five search trends, with data from the Google News Lab.Wine not?Today is National Wine Day, so watch for your dinner companions to have too many sips of “frose” and turn in early. The denizens of DC, Kansas, and New York were the most keen to know when National Wine Day was taking place. When comparing \"red,\" \"rosé\" and \"white\" wine over the last 30 days, red wine is searched nearly twice as much as white, with average interest at 68 percent compared to peak spikes the weekend of May 12-13. Fittingly, interest in rosé is sitting pretty, right in between.Marking Memorial Day Red, white, and blue too: This Monday is Memorial Day, so people across the country are looking up tips and tricks for their patriotic celebrations. Top three questions this week on Memorial day were 1) “What was Memorial Day originally called?” 2) “Is today Memorial Day?” And 3) ”When did Memorial Day become a holiday?” Number 2 is my favorite.Voted off the tie-landThe tribe has spoken … A tribe of reality TV contest candidates and also lots of people who still watch this amazingly long-running show. (Oh how it SURVIVES!) This week’s “Survivor” finale came down to a tie for the first time in the show’s 36-season history and long-standing show fanatics were deep in their feelings about it. Queries like “Who won Survivor 2018 Ghost Island?” and “Survivor fan favorite 2018” spiked over 2,500 percent (!), proving that there are whole worlds out there I know nothing about.Drawing sides on strawsIt’s 2018, so naturally people are taking sides on straws. McDonald’s is under pressure to scrap drinking straws for environmental reasons. Critics claim straws suck for the environment; they’re also super fun to use to drink things. Search interest in “McDonald’s straw” spiked by 230 percent at one point, surpassing search interest in “McDonald’s McFlurry.” While the top two most searched questions this week relating to McDonalds were about straws, the third one, comfortingly, was: “When does McDonald’s breakfast end?” A verdict in 280 charactersA Texas police officer, a New York comedy writer and a Nashville surgeon walk into a courtroom … And the three are among a group that brought a lawsuit against President Trump for blocking them on Twitter. A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Trump’s blocking users on Twitter violates the First Amendment. Searchers turned to Google to ask: “Who are the plaintiffs in the Trump Twitter lawsuit?” and “Who has Trump blocked on Twitter?”"

After Prince William and Kate Middleton welcomed a son into the world this week, searches for “name of new royal baby” went up more than 3,000 percent. The newly-named Prince Louis’s siblings were also of interest—searches for “Prince George full name” went up 1,000 percent, and “Who is Princess Charlotte named after?” was also a trending question.Trying to conjure up some tickets Muggles and wizards alike are wondering “How much are tickets to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child?” (we’re guessing it’ll be a lot of Galleons). They may be ditching Orlando for New York—the play was more popular in Search than the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, but not quite as popular as “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” which was the most searched Broadway play this week.More baby newsAn image of a shirtless Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson holding his newborn baby girl went viral this week, and people oooh-ed and aaah-ed all over Search (interest in “the rock new baby” went up 2,750 percent). This was after he got a heartfelt invitation to prom from a superfan in Minnesota, which caused searches for “the rock prom” to go up 1,850 percent. Quite the week!Lettuce warn you Search questions are a mixed bag, but here’s one that stood out this week: “Is it safe to eat romaine lettuce yet?” If you’d like some side trends with your salad, there’s been a 1,000 percent increase in searches for “ecoli virus,” and the most searches for “e. coli” are coming from Alaska, Montana and Idaho.An ending to marvel at “The Avengers: Infinity War” hit the big screen this week, and there’s one thing on everyone’s mind: “Who dies in Infinity War?” Searches for “infinity war spoilers who dies” went up nearly 1,000 percent this week. We won’t spoil anything, but according to one top Search question—”How many post-credit scenes are there in Infinity War?”—you should stick around until the very end."

            "Autocomplete is a feature within Google Search designed to make it faster to complete searches that you’re beginning to type. In this post—the second in a series that goes behind-the-scenes about Google Search—we’ll explore when, where and how autocomplete works.Using autocompleteAutocomplete is available most anywhere you find a Google search box, including the Google home page, the Google app for iOS and Android, the quick search box from within Android and the “Omnibox” address bar within Chrome. Just begin typing, and you’ll see predictions appear:",
            "In the example above, you can see that typing the letters “san f” brings up predictions such as “san francisco weather” or “san fernando mission,” making it easy to finish entering your search on these topics without typing all the letters.Sometimes, we’ll also help you complete individual words and phrases, as you type:",
            "Autocomplete is especially useful for those using mobile devices, making it easy to complete a search on a small screen where typing can be hard. For both mobile and desktop users, it’s a huge time saver all around. How much? Well:On average, it reduces typing by about 25 percentCumulatively, we estimate it saves over 200 years of typing time per day. Yes, per day!",
            "Predictions, not suggestionsYou’ll notice we call these autocomplete “predictions” rather than “suggestions,” and there’s a good reason for that. Autocomplete is designed to help people complete a search they were intending to do, not to suggest new types of searches to be performed. These are our best predictions of the query you were likely to continue entering.How do we determine these predictions? We look at the real searches that happen on Google and show common and trending ones relevant to the characters that are entered and also related to your location and previous searches.The predictions change in response to new characters being entered into the search box. For example, going from “san f” to “san fe” causes the San Francisco-related predictions shown above to disappear, with those relating to San Fernando then appearing at the top of the list:",
            "That makes sense. It becomes clear from the additional letter that someone isn’t doing a search that would relate to San Francisco, so the predictions change to something more relevant.Why some predictions are removedThe predictions we show are common and trending ones related to what someone begins to type. However, Google removes predictions that are against our autocomplete policies, which bar:Sexually explicit predictions that are not related to medical, scientific, or sex education topicsHateful predictions against groups and individuals on the basis of race, religion or several other demographicsViolent predictionsDangerous and harmful activity in predictions",
            "In addition to these policies, we may remove predictions that we determine to be spam, that are closely associated with piracy, or in response to valid legal requests.A guiding principle here is that autocomplete should not shock users with unexpected or unwanted predictions.This principle and our autocomplete policies are also why popular searches as measured in our Google Trends tool might not appear as predictions within autocomplete. Google Trends is designed as a way for anyone to deliberately research the popularity of search topics over time. Autocomplete removal policies are not used for Google Trends.",
            "Why inappropriate predictions happenWe have systems in place designed to automatically catch inappropriate predictions and not show them. However, we process billions of searches per day, which in turn means we show many billions of predictions each day. Our systems aren’t perfect, and inappropriate predictions can get through. When we’re alerted to these, we strive to quickly remove them.It’s worth noting that while some predictions may seem odd, shocking or cause a “Who would search for that!” reaction, looking at the actual search results they generate sometimes provides needed context. As we explained earlier this year, the search results themselves may make it clearer in some cases that predictions don’t necessarily reflect awful opinions that some may hold but instead may come from those seeking specific content that’s not problematic. It’s also important to note that predictions aren’t search results and don’t limit what you can search for.Regardless, even if the context behind a prediction is good, even if a prediction is infrequent,  it’s still an issue if the prediction is inappropriate. It’s our job to reduce these as much as possible.Our latest efforts against inappropriate predictionsTo better deal with inappropriate predictions, we launched a feedback tool last year and have been using the data since to make improvements to our systems. In the coming weeks, expanded criteria applying to hate and violence will be in force for policy removals.Our existing policy protecting groups and individuals against hateful predictions only covers cases involving race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation or gender identity. Our expanded policy for search will cover any case where predictions are reasonably perceived as hateful or prejudiced toward individuals and groups, without particular demographics.With the greater protections for individuals and groups, there may be exceptions where compelling public interest allows for a prediction to be retained. With groups, predictions might also be retained if there’s clear “attribution of source” indicated. For example, predictions for song lyrics or book titles that might be sensitive may appear, but only when combined with words like “lyrics” or “book” or other cues that indicate a specific work is being sought.As for violence, our policy will expand to cover removal of predictions which seem to advocate, glorify or trivialize violence and atrocities, or which disparage victims.How to report inappropriate predictionsOur expanded policies will roll out in the coming weeks. We hope that the new policies, along with other efforts with our systems, will improve autocomplete overall. But with billions of predictions happening each day, we know that we won’t catch everything that’s inappropriate. Should you spot something, you can report using the “Report inappropriate predictions” link we launched last year, which appears below the search box on desktop:",
            "For those on mobile or using the Google app for Android, long press on a prediction to get a reporting option. Those using the Google app on iOS can swipe to the left to get the reporting option.By the way, if we take action on a reported prediction that violates our policies, we don’t just remove that particular prediction. We expand to ensure we’re also dealing with closely related predictions. Doing this work means sometimes an inappropriate prediction might not immediately disappear, but spending a little extra time means we can provide a broader solution.Making predictions richer and more usefulAs said above, our predictions show in search boxes that range from desktop to mobile to within our Google app. The appearance, order and some of the predictions themselves can vary along with this.When you’re using Google on desktop, you’ll typically see up to 10 predictions. On a mobile device, you’ll typically see up to five, as there’s less screen space.On mobile or Chrome on desktop, we may show you information like dates, the local weather, sports information and more below a prediction:",
            "In the Google app, you may also notice that some of the predictions have little logos or images next to them. That’s a sign that we have special Knowledge Graph information about that topic, structured information that’s often especially useful to mobile searchers:",
            "Predictions also will vary because the list may include any related past searches you’ve done. We show these to help you quickly get back to a previous search you may have conducted:",
            "You can tell if a past search is appearing because on desktop, you’ll see the word “Remove” appear next to a prediction. Click on that word if you want to delete the past search.On mobile, you’ll see a clock icon on the left and an X button on the right. Click on the X to delete a past search. In the Google App, you’ll also see a clock icon. To remove a prediction, long press on it in Android or swipe left on iOS to reveal a delete option.You can also delete all your past searches in bulk, or by particular dates or those matching particular terms using My Activity in your Google Account.More about autocompleteWe hope this post has helped you understand more about autocomplete, including how we’re working to reduce inappropriate predictions and to increase the usefulness of the feature. For more, you can also see our help page about autocomplete.You can also check out the recent Wired video interview below, where our our vice president of search Ben Gomes and the product manager of autocomplete Chris Haire answer questions about autocomplete that came from…autocomplete!"

            "Every Friday, we look back at five trending topics in Search from that week, and then give ourselves a High Five for making it to the weekend. Today we’re putting our hands together for National High Five Day—so first, a few notable “high five” trends. Then on to our regularly scheduled programming.High Fives all aroundTurns out, searches for “high five” transcend all realms of culture: sports (“Why do NBA players high five after free throws?”) entertainment (“how to high five a Sim”), and pets (“How to teach a dog to high five”). As for virtual high fives, “Scrubs,” “Seinfeld” and Liz Lemon are high five famous—they’re the top trending “high five gifs.”A First Lady, first a motherWhen former First Lady Barbara Bush passed away on Tuesday at the age of 92, people remembered her role as matriarch, searching for “Barbara Bush children,” “Barbara Bush family,” and “Barbara Bush grandchildren.” She was the second woman to be the mother and wife of a president; and searches for the first woman to hold that title, Abigail Adams (wife of John and mother of John Quincy) went up by 1,150 percent this week.What’s Swedish for robot?Need an extra set of hands? A team of researchers built a robot to help with one of the most challenging tasks of the modern era—assembling Ikea furniture. In an ordinary week, people might search for Ikea lamp, but for now they’re more interested in “Ikea robot.” Though Swedish meatballs are always a favorite, this week’s trending Ikea furniture items were Ikea closets, plants and sofas.Work it, WalmartWalmart’s store aisles are turning into runways with the new employee dress code. They can now wear jeans and–brace yourselves–any solid color top. As for bottoms, people want to know, “Are leggings included in Walmart’s new dress code?” We never (Arkan)saw this coming, but Arkansas topped the list of regions searching for “Walmart dress code” in the U.S. For people wondering about other dress code etiquette, a trending question was “what to wear to jury duty.”Kendrick makes historyThis week people asked “Why is Kendrick Lamar important?” Listen to this: he made music history by being the first non-classical or jazz musician to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music Composition (high five, Kendrick!). And people felt the pull to search for “Kendrick Lamar prize”—interest was 900 percent higher than “Kendrick Lamar song.”"

            "The #MeToo movement has inspired growing, worldwide awareness of sexual violence and sexual assault. This is not only a significant moment in history; it’s a significant moment in internet history: #MeToo marks a time when sexual assault survivors everywhere turned the internet into a platform for their voices and perspectives to be heard and respected.In recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, we created Me Too Rising, a visualization of the global #MeToo movement through Google Trends data. On the site, you can look at global interest starting last fall and watch as consciousness spreads over time. In the past year, #MeToo has been searched in 195 countries—that's every country on earth. You can see the cities where it was trending on different dates and see what’s happening now at local levels with city-specific Google Search results for “Me Too.” And the sexual assault resources page has information for anyone who needs help or wants to learn more about sexual assault.To make it easier for survivors to find support, Google.org is providing $500,000 in grants to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) and Girls for Gender Equity. The two grants will provide increased support to RAINN’s National Sexual Assault Hotline and help Girls for Gender Equity launch a digital community where survivors can access tools to craft their own healing journeys.I recently had the honor of hearing from Tarana Burke, whose decade-long effort as the founder of the #MeToo Movement has given voice to the survivors of sexual assault. With Google Trends, we now have data to reflect the power of those collective voices—we can see how far-reaching this movement has become.",
            "Me Too Rising shows what it looks like when we all become a little more aware of sexual assault and violence. When enough survivors speak up, the world not only listens; it searches for answers."

            "Whether you’re on the hunt for a flower crown or a corsage, here’s what that ol’ internet has been up to this week … People are searching for Coachella—specifically, “what is Coachella”? It’s a music festival in the middle of the desert in California where bandanas are worn, parasols are twirled and selfies are taken (other Coachella items trending on Search are dust masks and earplugs… not as cute.) If you’re looking to see “who is performing?” you’ll be pleased to learn that two of the top-searched artists at Coachella are Beyonce and Cardi B (but Cardi was searched 3,200 percent more than Bey this week). For those who have to wait a few years to bask in the sweet sun of the Coachella Valley, the fluorescent light of a high school gym will have to suffice. That’s because it’s prom season, and the kids are wondering “is prom worth it?” and searching for creative promposals (prom + proposal) like “Fornite promposal” and “The Office promposal.” It’s not prom without a corsage and boutonniere (but who can spell that?). Amidst the prom-mania, “How to spell boutonniere” was a trending question this week.  If you thought your prom was cheesy, it’s got nothing on the next trend. On Thursday, sandwich enthusiasts celebrated National Grilled Cheese Day, and they took to Google to learn new ways to make the delicious treat—searches for grilled cheese were up 300 percent. Trending types of grilled cheese were “Taco grilled cheese,” “Keto grilled cheese” and “garlic bread grilled cheese.” Spring comes, snow melts, and people search for pollen. Is that the saying? Whatever. The next trend is pollen. Probably because there’s a lot of it in the air. People were more interested in “pollen allergy” than “food allergy” this week, and a top trending question was “how does pollen cause allergies?” 🤷 Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth welcomed her second child into the world this week, making her the first U.S. Senator to give birth while in office. The announcement of her new baby had some people searching ”How old is Tammy Duckworth?” and brought up questions about maternity leave—“how long is maternity leave?” and “when to take maternity leave?” were trending questions this week."

Here’s a look at some of the top searches from this week, with data from Google News Lab.Cracking open Easter trendsThis weekend, families across the country will gather to celebrate Easter and the beginning of Passover. As this week’s trends show, nothing brings people together like food. Scalloped potatoes and pie top the most-searched recipes for Easter Sunday, and some people are planning for Mass on Saturday: “How long is Easter Vigil Mass?” was one of the top trending Easter-related queries. People are also getting crafty at home in preparation for egg hunts, asking: “how to boil eggs for Easter?”As for Passover preparations, charoset and brisket were the most popular “Passover Seder recipes,” while search interest in “passover greetings in English” went up 450 percent. Chag sameach!Taking it to the holeThe NCAA Final Four games are upon us, and Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, Michigan and Indiana are the top states searching for “March Madness.” Meanwhile in Illinois, Loyola-Chicago isn’t the only breakout star of the tournament—search interest in their holy good luck charm Sister Jean rose over 1,000 percent this week. People are even wondering “what did Sister Jean give up for Lent?”Call it a comebackSearch interest in Roseanne Barr spiked over 300 percent on Tuesday, as the 2018 reboot of the popular television series premiered on ABC. Top questions about the show included “who is Jerry on Roseanne?” and “how many people watched Roseanne?” (somewhere in the ballpark of 18 million viewers).Snap, crackle, pop“Why are my knuckles cracking?” was a trending question this week. And it was answered by researchers in the U.S. and France who found out it’s caused by tiny bubbles collapsing in the fluid of the joint as the pressure changes. It looks like the three M’s—Minnesota, Michigan and Maryland—are among the top regions searching for “knuckles cracking.” Attempt at your own risk.Swing batter, batter, swing Just in time for Major League Baseball’s Opening Day, search interest in “top MLB  prospects for 2018” spiked over 400 percent this week. Top trending teams included the Chicago Cubs, Detroit Tigers and New York Yankees, and Scott Kingery, Salvador Pérez and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. rounded the bases as some of the top trending players."

            "Springtime means new beginnings, and that seems to be the case for Ringo Starr and Cynthia Nixon who made their foray into knighthood and state politics this week. But they’re not the only ones who captured people’s attention in Search this week. Here’s a look at the top trends, thanks to data from Google News Lab. Finding answers in AustinThe question on many people’s minds—“who was the Austin bomber?”—was answered early Wednesday morning when law enforcement identified Mark Conditt as the man behind the string of exploding  packages. San Antonio, Waco-Temple-Bryan, Victoria and San Angelo were among the top metros looking for more information on the Austin bomber. It’s finally spring...kinda“Is today the first day of spring?” was the top trending question across the east coast this week as residents braced for a not-so-warm welcome to the new season. Storm Toby brought a wintery mix of snow, sleet and gusty winds on Wednesday and had people in DC, Maryland, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts searching for information on flight cancellations. Spring officially sprung on Tuesday, in case you didn’t know! Starry Knight“Don’t pass me by”—Sir Richard “Ringo Starr” Starkey is the latest member of the Beatles to be knighted. Prince William performed the ceremony on Tuesday, 21 years after the other surviving Beatle, Paul McCartney, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. Despite search interest in “Ringo Starr” spiking 400+ percent higher than “Paul McCartney,” John Lennon was the most searched band member of the week. It’s a battle of the Beatles! Politics in the City Miranda Hobbes fans unite: Cynthia Nixon is running for Governor of New York. Best known for her role in the hit HBO series “Sex in the City,” Nixon is taking her talents off screen and into the ballot box. She’ll challenge current New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for the seat—and is already off to the races, with search interest in “Cynthia Nixon” spiking over 1,300 percent of “Andrew Cuomo” on Monday. Guess Carrie Bradshaw isn’t the only leading lady in town! The boy with the phoenix tattoo Elephants, flowers, lions and butterflies were among the most searched tattoo designs this week, but it’s Ben Affleck’s colorful ink that has everyone talking. The actor was caught showing off his back tattoo while on a beach in Hawaii. Fans and tattoo artists alike have their opinions about the massive phoenix rising from the ashes, so much so that search interest “Ben Affleck tattoo” was more than 1,200 percent higher than interest in “Ben Affleck movie.” But the top trending question remains, “is Ben Affleck’s tattoo real?” Dun, dun, dun."

            "People come to Google looking for information they can trust, and that information often comes from the reporting of journalists and news organizations around the world. And while the demand for quality journalism is as high as it’s ever been, the business of journalism is under pressure, as publications around the world face challenges from an industry-wide transition to digital.That matters deeply to Google. After all, our mission to build a more informed world is inherently tied to the reporting of journalists and news organizations. Our shared mission also reflects shared business interests. Platforms like Search and YouTube depend on a healthy ecosystem of publishers producing great digital content. That’s why it’s so important to us that we help you drive sustainable revenue and businesses. Last year, we paid $12.6 billion to partners and we drove 10 billion clicks a month to publishers’ websites for free. It’s also why over the years, we’ve worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges. We worked with the industry to launch the open-source Accelerated Mobile Pages Project to improve the mobile web, YouTube Player for Publishers to simplify video distribution and reduce costs, Flexible Sampling to help with discovery of news content on Google, Google News Lab to provide newsrooms with trainings and editorial partnerships, and the Digital News Initiative to drive innovation in the European news industry.We invested a lot time and energy in these collaborations. But the hard truth is—all of this might not be enough. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish what’s true (and not true) online. Business models for journalism continue to change drastically. The rapid evolution of technology is challenging all institutions, including the news industry—to keep pace. We need to do more. That’s why we’re launching the Google News Initiative (GNI), our effort to help journalism thrive in the digital age. The GNI signifies a major milestone in Google’s 15-year commitment to the news industry, and will bring together everything we do in collaboration with the industry—across products, partnerships, and programs—to help build a stronger future for news.The GNI will build on these efforts and deepen our commitment to a news industry facing dramatic shifts in how journalism is created, consumed, and paid for. It’s focused on three objectives: Elevate and strengthen quality journalism  Evolve business models to drive sustainable growthEmpower news organizations through technological innovationElevate and strengthen quality journalismOver the past few years, we’ve worked with publishers to elevate accurate, quality content and stem the flow of misinformation and disinformation.On our own platforms, we’re focused on combating misinformation during breaking news situations.  Bad actors often target breaking news on Google platforms, increasing the likelihood that people are exposed to inaccurate content. So we’ve trained our systems to recognize these events and adjust our signals toward more authoritative content. There are comparable challenges on YouTube, and we’re taking a similar approach, highlighting relevant content from verified news sources in a “Top News” shelf.But we’re also working directly with news organizations to combat misinformation. We’re launching the Disinfo Lab alongside the First Draft to combat mis- and disinformation during elections and breaking news moments. Finally, to help consumers distinguish fact from fiction online,  we’re teaming up with the Poynter Institute, Stanford University, and the Local Media Association to launch MediaWise, a U.S. project designed to improve digital information literacy for young consumers.",
            "Evolve business models to drive sustainable growthOver the last decade, we’ve worked closely with news organizations to grow their digital advertising revenue. In just the past few years, we’ve applied our advanced machine learning expertise to automatically surface key insights about revenue opportunities (generating recommendations worth over $300 million in additional revenue) and supported the creation of faster, better ad experiences for the mobile web through AMP and native ads.But consumers are willing to pay for digital news content, creating an opportunity to expand beyond ad revenue. Today we’re delivering on a vision outlined last year to enable publishers to diversify their revenue streams. We’re excited to launch Subscribe with Google, a way for people to easily subscribe to various news outlets, helping publishers engage readers across Google and the web. Our goal with Subscribe with Google is to ease the subscription process to get more readers consuming publishers’ journalism, as quickly as possible.   In October, at our Partner Leadership Summit, we told publishers about how we’re experimenting with ways to grow their subscriptions using Google data, machine learning, and DoubleClick infrastructure. We’re now in the early stages of testing a “Propensity to Subscribe” signal based on machine learning models in DoubleClick to make it easier for publishers to recognize potential subscribers, and to present them the right offer at the right time.Of course, not every publication has the resources to dedicate a team to collect, analyze and understand their user data. News Consumer Insights, our new dashboard built on top of Google Analytics, will help news organizations of all sizes understand and segment their audiences with a subscriptions strategy in mind. At the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, this project led to a 150 percent increase in pageviews to their Subscribe pages and a month-over-month tripling of new digital subscription purchases.",
            "Empower news organizations through technological innovationWe work with news organizations around the world to develop and deploy technology that improves newsroom efficiency, creates enriching storytelling experiences, and protects journalists from cyber attacks around the world.  For example, we’re using our natural language processing API to help Hearst Newspapers sort, label and categorize more than 3,000 articles every day. We’ve also worked with the South China Morning Post to use Google Earth to create immersive VR experiences that show the evolution of Hong Kong throughout history. With AMP Stories, which is now in beta, publishers can combine the speed of AMP with the rich, immersive storytelling of the open web. This is just the beginning. We want to continue working closely with publishers to experiment on new ways they can reach audiences and produce impactful storytelling.Finally, we’re also launching today Outline, an open-source tool from Jigsaw that lets news organizations provide journalists more secure access to the internet. Outline makes it easy for news organizations to set up their own VPN on a private server—no tech savvy required.Our commitmentOver the next three years, we’re committing $300 million toward meeting these goals. We’re also deepening our commitment to building products that address the news industry’s most urgent needs. In the past, we’ve done this by working closely alongside the industry in product working groups, resulting in projects like AMP and the DNI. We’ll be expanding that model globally.The commitments we’re making through the Google News Initiative demonstrate that news and quality journalism is a top priority for Google. We know that success can only be achieved by working together, and we look forward to collaborating with the news industry to build a stronger future for journalism."

            "Sifting through the week’s news can feel like sinking into a black hole. Luckily, we have some standout trends this week, gathered with data from Google News Lab. They start with a tribute to legendary physicist and black hole escape artist Stephen Hawking, who passed away Wednesday at age 76.“Look up”Stephen Hawking’s intelligence was a cut above the rest, in life and in Search: interest in “Stephen Hawking IQ” was 170 percent higher than “Stephen Hawking quote” over the past week. But of his many memorable quotes, here’s the most searched: “Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.”Turbulent times“What happened on United Airlines?” was a trending question this week. The company faced scrutiny after a French bulldog—the second most searched dog breed this week—suffocated in an overhead compartment and a pet German Shepherd was accidentally shipped to Japan. For those searching for canine breeds this week, Rhodesian Ridgebacks were top dog.A cue from teensSearch interest in “walkout” has reached an all-time high in the U.S. this month. On Wednesday, students around the country participated in a walkout to call on elected officials to take action on gun laws—the top cities searching for “walkout” were Charlottesville, VA, Fort Smith, AR, and Madison, WI.It’s bracket season March Madness is in full swing, especially for North Carolina, Duke and Kentucky fans, whose teams have been the most searched in the past week. The top-searched celebrity brackets are from basketball commentator Jay Bilas, former President Barack Obama, and Warren Buffett. And the winner is anyone’s guess: Michigan State, favored by both Bilas and Obama, wasn’t among the top 10 teams being searched this week.Go greenSaturday marks St. Patrick’s Day and, in true spirit, corned beef and cabbage is the top trending St. Patrick’s Day recipe this week, followed by … jello shots 🤔. If you’re feeling lucky, you might be among those searching for lucky horseshoes, lucky cats and lucky clovers (the top searched “lucky” items in the past week). And although New York has the biggest parade and Boston the biggest reputation, the top states searching for the holiday are Connecticut, Kansas, and Delaware. Illinois, where Chicagoans annually dye their river green, comes in at number four."

            "People around the world use Google Images to find visual information online. Whether you’re searching for ideas for your next baking project, how to tie shoelaces so they stay put, or tips on the proper form for doing a plank, scanning image results can be much more helpful than scanning text. Today, we’re sharing more about new changes to Google Images to provide even better visual discovery with more context on the image results page.By adding more context around images, results can become much more useful. Last year we started showing badges (like “recipe” or “product”) on certain results to aid in the discovery process. Since then, we’ve also added the website’s domain URL for each result to show you where the image is coming from. This week we’re adding captions to image results, showing you the title of the web page where each image is published. This extra piece of information gives you  more context so you can easily find out what the image is about and whether the website would contain more relevant content for your needs. Here’s how it looks:",
            "In this example, the image results give you visual confirmation that you found the right fruit, but captions make results instantly more useful with additional context. For instance, you can learn that this fruit is called carambola or starfruit, and that it’s popular in China. This also helps you choose the result page to click and explore further.This update underscores our ongoing goal to make Google Images an ever more useful tool to discover and explore more information from the web. Image captions are starting to roll out globally this week on the Google app (Android and iOS) and on mobile browsers."

            "The world learned about new words—whether from Merriam-Webster or Frances McDormand— this week. Here are a few of the week’s top-searched trends (with data from the Google News Lab):The words of our generation: “Dumpster fire,” once relegated to internet-speak, has made it into the official lexicon—one of 850 new words that Merriam-Webster added to the dictionary—and was up 3,200 percent in Search. Embiggen (a word invented by “The Simpsons,” that means “to get bigger”) embiggened with a 2,000 percent spike in search interest, while mansplain went up 500 percent.First woman to … “land a triple axel” and “go to MIT.” These are the top two rising searches over the past year for women who have broken barriers, and with International Women’s Day this week, searches about women continued. Frances McDormand, Jennifer Lawrence and Tiffany Haddish were the leading ladies in Search, and across the world, top searches for “gender equality” came from Nicaragua, Mexico and Sweden.Say that one more time: After Frances McDormand’s speech at the Oscars, “inclusion rider” became a breakout search term (meaning there was a tremendous increase in search interest, possibly reflecting a term that had few, if any, prior searches). Since the term was relatively unknown, some people heard “inclusion writer,” which also saw a search increase (only 450 percent less than the correct term, “inclusion rider”).Sweet tooth: M&M’s are mixing it up with new flavors—Crunchy Espresso, Crunchy Raspberry, and Crunchy Mint. Despite these new additions, “Neapolitan”—another limited-edition flavor—was the top-searched M&M flavor this week, and M&M-thusiasts are searching for recipes for M&M cookie, M&M cookie with peanut butter, and M&M cake.Putting Nikumaroro on the map: Search interest for “Pacific Island of Nikumaroro” soared 4,600 percent after new forensic analysis of bones found there belong to Amelia Earhart."

We’re always working to improve Gboard for people wherever they are, no matter which language they’re typing in.Today, we’re bringing Chinese (both traditional and simplified Chinese) and Korean—plus twenty additional languages—to Gboard for Android. We heard from our users that these were the top two languages we needed to add to the keyboard, and now, Gboard for Android supports over 300 language varieties (covering 74% of the world’s population). You can see the full list of supported languages here, and the new ones will be rolling out worldwide over the next few days.",
            "Though today’s update includes some of the world’s most widely-spoken languages, we’re equally focused on making sure lesser-known languages, like Manx and Maori, are represented in the keyboard. Often, incorporating new languages leads us to meet people we might have never known—like brothers Abdoulaye and Ibrahima Barry, who we recently worked with to bring the Fulani alphabet, Adlam, to Gboard. Though Fulani has been spoken in Africa for hundreds of years, the language didn’t have its own written alphabet until these brothers invented one twenty-six years ago in Guinea. Because Adlam wasn’t on Gboard, it was difficult for native speakers to represent the true sounds of their language when they were typing. To fix this, we worked alongside Abdoulaye and Ibrahima to design and test an Adlam layout in the keyboard. We ultimately settled upon the layout that is live on Gboard today. (To learn more about the story behind the Barry brothers’ inspiring work, check out their Talk at Google, a talk from Google’s speaker series.)",
            "Each new language helps more people express themselves with their keyboard, and we’re thankful to the thousands of linguists and native speakers around the globe who help us bring new languages to Gboard. We’ve been lucky to meet new people—like Abdoulaye and Ibrahima—along the way. There are still many people to meet and languages to discover, so our work won’t end here."

            "This week, Barbra Streisand revealed that two of her canine companions are actually clones of her beloved dog Samantha, who died last year. People took to Search to find out “How much does it cost to clone a dog?” and “How does dog cloning work?” In fact, people unleashed their curiosity for “cloned dog” 1,900 percent more than “cloned sheep,” which was the first-ever cloned mammal. (Coincidentally, the sheep was named after another music legend in the news this week, Dolly Parton.)Here’s a peek at a few other top searches from this week, with data from Google News Lab.Weight in gold: Leading up to the Oscars this weekend, a top-searched question was “How much does an Oscar weigh?” (We’ll save you the search—it’s 8.5 pounds!). Margot Robbie leads searches for Lead Actress nominees, and Timothée Chalamet is most searched among the Lead Actor nominees. And before the ceremony, go back a few decades with the top-searched Oscar movies of all time. Not so Golden: Search interest in “California quality of life” was searched 700 percent more than “California cost of living after “U.S. News and World Report” deemed California the state with the worst quality of life. Listen to this: When Spotify filed to go public this week, search interest in Spotify IPO went up 4,800 percent and people want to know, “Where can I buy Spotify stock?” and “How to invest in Spotify.”Reading 9 to 5: After donating  its 100 millionth book, search interest in Dolly Parton’s nonprofit “Imagination Library” went up by 270 percent. As a singer and philanthropist, Parton wears many hats—and her most-searched song is “Coat of Many Colors.”"

When we ask about “heat from the center of the earth,” for example, we could be asking about what causes it or how hot it is. And if we ask about “ears popping on a plane,” we might be looking for the cause or for remedies. To provide more actionable results to nuanced queries like these, today we’re starting to roll out multifaceted featured snippets.Sometimes the words we use to ask a question are broad and there could be several different interpretations of the question. With multifaceted featured snippets, we’re able to better understand your query and recognize when there could be multiple interpretations of that query. In the example below with the query “garden needs full sun?” we’re able to recognize that it could be interpreted as “what garden plants need full sun?” or “what counts as full sun?” and offer featured snippets for both.",
            "There are several types of nuanced queries where showing more comprehensive results could be helpful. We’re starting first with “multi-intent” queries, which are queries that have several potential intentions or purposes associated. The query “tooth pain after a filling,” for example, could be interpreted as “why does my tooth still hurt after a filling?” or “how long should a tooth hurt after a filling?”As we shared before, we aim to expand multifaceted featured snippets to cover a broader set of nuanced queries beyond just “multi-intent” queries. For example, guidance-seeking queries like “is it worth fixing my foundation?” have several components that could be important, such as cost, duration, methods and financing. We’ll continue to experiment with multifaceted featured snippets over this year to expand coverage.  With any new feature we introduce in Search, we work to ensure that we’re providing a helpful experience. In addition to extensive testing to determine whether a change has a positive effect on search quality, we also take into account feedback from you. If you see a result that you have feedback on, we encourage you to submit your thoughts through the feedback link on the search results page."

Jordan has been searched the most of all the Black Panther cast members, while Nakia is the top-searched character. Tote-ally fashion: A $590 grocery bag-style tote from the French brand Céline was a top-searched trend that emerged from Fashion Week. Anna Wintour, who sat with Queen Elizabeth at Fashion Week, was also top of mind—search interest in the fashion icon went up 500 percent.Missed a beat: After Fergie’s sultry rendition of the national anthem at the NBA All Star Game, search interest in the singer-songwriter increased 1300 percent.

It’s especially helpful for those on mobile or searching by voice.Here are a few examples where featured snippets enhance the search experience by making it easier to access information from good sources, big and small:",
            "Featured snippets aren’t just for written content. Our recently launched video featured snippets jump you directly to the right place in a video, such as for how to braid your own hair:",
            "Featured snippets help with mobile and voice searchMobile search traffic has surpassed desktop traffic worldwide. And with the growth in voice-activated digital assistants, more people are doing voice queries. In these cases, the traditional \"10 blue links\" format doesn't work as well, making featured snippets an especially useful format.Of course, we continue to show regular listings in response to searches along with featured snippets. That’s because featured snippets aren’t meant as a sole source of information. They’re part of an overall set of results we provide, giving people information from a wide range of sources.People click on featured snippets to learn moreWhen we introduced featured snippets in January 2014, there were some concerns that they might cause publishers to lose traffic. What if someone learns all they need to know from the snippet and doesn’t visit the source site?It quickly became clear that featured snippets do indeed drive traffic. That’s why publishers share tips on how to increase the chances of becoming one, because they recognize being featured in this way is a traffic driver.When it comes to spoken featured snippets, we cite the source page in the spoken result and provide a link to the page within the Google Home app, so people can click and learn more:",
            "We recognize that featured snippets have to work in a way that helps support the sources that ultimately makes them possible. That’s why we always take publishers into account when we make updates to this feature.Working to improve featured snippetsThe vast majority of featured snippets work well, as we can tell from usage stats and from what our search quality raters report to us, people paid to evaluate the quality of our results. A third-party test last year by Stone Temple found a 97.4 percent accuracy rate for featured snippets and related formats like Knowledge Graph information.Because featured snippets are so useful, especially with mobile and voice-only searches, we’re working hard to smooth out bumps with them as they continue to grow and evolve.Last year, we took deserved criticism for featured snippets that said things like “women are evil” or that former U.S. President Barack Obama was planning a coup. We failed in these cases because we didn’t weigh the authoritativeness of results strongly enough for such rare and fringe queries.To improve, we launched an effort that included updates to our Search Quality Rater Guidelines to provide more detailed examples of low-quality webpages for raters to appropriately flag, which can include misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and unsupported conspiracy theories. This work has helped our systems better identify when results are prone to low-quality content. If detected, we may opt not to show a featured snippet.Even when a featured snippet has good content, we occasionally appear to goof because it might not seem the best response to a query. On the face of it, it might not appear to respond to a query at all.For example, a search for “How did the Romans tell time at night” until recently suggested sundials, which would be useless in the dark:",
            "While the example above might give you a chuckle, we take issues like this seriously, as we do with any problems reported to us or that we spot internally. We study them and use those learnings to make improvements for featured snippets overall. In this case, it led to us providing a better response: water clocks.When near-matches can be helpfulAnother improvement we’re considering is to better communicate when we give you a featured snippet that’s not exactly what you searched for but close enough that it helps you get to the information you seek.For example, the original “sundial” featured snippet above was actually a response for “How did Romans tell time.” We displayed this near-match then because we didn’t have enough confidence to show a featured snippet specifically about how Romans told time at night. We knew sundials were used by Romans to tell time generally, because so many pages discussed this. How they told time at night was less discussed, so we had less data to make a firm connection.Showing a near-match may seem odd at first glance, but we know in such cases that people often explore the source of a featured snippet and discover what they’re looking for. In this case, the page that the featured snippet originally came from did explain that Romans used water clocks to tell time at night. We just didn't then have enough confidence then to display that information as a featured snippet.We’re considering increasing the use of a format we currently employ only in some limited situations, to make it clearer when we serve a near-match. For example, we might display \"How did Romans tell time?\" above the featured snippet, as illustrated in the mockup below:",
            "Our testing and experiments will guide what we ultimately do here. We might not expand use of the format, if our testing finds people often inherently understand a near-match is being presented without the need for an explicit label.Improving results by showing more than one featured snippetSometimes, a single featured snippet isn’t right for every question. For example, “how to setup call forwarding” varies by carrier. That’s where a recent feature we launched lets you interactively select a featured snippet specific to your situation. In the example below, you can see how it allows people to quickly locate solutions from various providers:",
            "Another format coming soon is designed to help people better locate information by showing more than one featured snippet that’s related to what they originally searched for:",
            "Showing more than one featured snippet may also eventually help in cases where you can get contradictory information when asking about the same thing but in different ways.For instance, people who search for “are reptiles good pets” should get the same featured snippet as “are reptiles bad pets” since they are seeking the same information: how do reptiles rate as pets? However, the featured snippets we serve contradict each other.",
            "This happens because sometimes our systems favor content that’s strongly aligned with what was asked. A page arguing that reptiles are good pets seems the best match for people who search about them being good. Similarly, a page arguing that reptiles are bad pets seems the best match for people who search about them being bad. We’re exploring solutions to this challenge, including showing multiple responses.\"There are often legitimate diverse perspectives offered by publishers, and we want to provide users visibility and access into those perspectives from multiple sources,” Matthew Gray, the software engineer who leads the featured snippets team, told me.Your feedback wantedFeatured snippets will never be absolutely perfect, just as search results overall will never be absolutely perfect. On a typical day, 15 percent of the queries we process have never been asked before. That’s just one of the challenges along with sifting through trillions of pages of information across the web to try and help people make sense of the world.Last year, we made it easier to send us feedback in cases where a featured snippet warrants review. Just use the “feedback” link at the bottom of a featured snippet box. Your feedback, along with our own internal testing and review, helps us keep improving the quality of featured snippets.",

            "This week, fans of NBC’s “This is Us” were fired up about a plotline involving main character Jack Pearson and a Crock-Pot. Trending questions on Search ranged from plot-related—“What happened on ‘This Is Us’ with the Crock-Pot?”—to practical—“How long can a Crock-Pot be on warm?” For those more interested in what’s cooking in their own kitchen, rather than in the Pearson family’s, these Crock-Pot recipes were the most searched this week: beef stew, vegetarian, chicken, pot roast and chili.Here’s a peek at a few other top searches that slow cooked this week, with data from Google News Lab.Shutdown for what: Amidst the U.S. government shutdown this week, people searched to find out which government services would shut down as well. The top searches for “Will government shutdown affect…” were tax refunds, social security, passport processing, Post Office and unemployment. While James Corden prepped … Others did some searching ahead of Sunday’s Grammy Awards. The most searched pop artist nominated for a Grammy was Ed Sheeran, while “Despacito” was the most searched “Song of the Year” nominee.Nobody’s perfect: When a camel beauty pageant in Saudi Arabia was interrupted due to the discovery that some camels had been injected with botox, attention shifted from the contest. Search interest in \"Camel botox\" spiked nearly 1,400 percent more than “Camel beauty pageant.”Cashing in: This week, rapper 50 Cent learned that he accidentally made over $7 million after people used Bitcoin to buy his album “Animal Ambition” in 2014. One top searched question—“How much did 50 Cent make from Bitcoin?”—naturally led to the next—“What is 50 Cent’s net worth?”"

That’s what Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys did this week when he went back to his high school for extra credit, turning an “F” he received in songwriting into an “A” …  58 years later later. A wave of searches about Wilson’s academic endeavors ensued: “Brian Wilson grade change,” “Brian Wilson back to school,” and “Where did Beach Boy Brian Wilson attend high school?” People are curious about where other well-known figures went to school as well. The most searched famous people and “high school” are Donald Trump, Kylie Jenner, James Franco, Jennifer Aniston and Kim Kardashian. Here’s a peek at a few other top searches from this week, with data from Google News Lab.Ballistic missile threat in Hawaii: On the day of the accidental false alarm, search interest for “fallout shelters” in Hawaii increased by nearly 10,000 percent. Counting down to the Winter Olympics: Searches for Katie Couric were 900 percent higher than her co-host Mike Tirico, and as of this week, the top-searched Olympic sports are ice hockey, snowboarding and figure skating. Shaking things up in Michigan: An unusual earthquake in Michigan turned out to be caused by a meteor. Searches for \"meteor\" were on a streak—in fact, they were 30 times higher than “Michigan earthquake.”When life gives you snow, make snow cream: A mixture of snow and a dairy-based liquid makes this winter sweet treat, and search interest is on the rise. In the U.S., searches for “how to make snow cream” were 290 percent higher than “how to make ice cream.”That’s it for this week, God Only Knows what trends will emerge next week."

            "Oprah’s speech had people buzzing, while Jimmy Ma spun to internet fame at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Here are some of the most-searched trends of the week (with data from the Google News Lab).A brighter morning, even during our darkest nights“Is Oprah going to run for president?” was a top searched question this week, after the icon’s rousing speech at the Golden Globes. Searches for “Oprah for President” were up more than 5,000 percent, and search interest in “Oprah 2020” was 1,200 percent higher than “Trump 2020.” And the region with the most searches for “Oprah 2020”? Home of the White House, Washington, D.C.Making waves The recent raw water trend has people wondering whether drinking untreated water is actually good for you, and search queries poured in: “How is well water different from raw water?” “Who endorses raw water?” and “How much does raw water cost?” This week, searches in “raw water” were 800 percent higher than “raw milk” and 300 percent higher than “raw food.”Roll tide Alabama Crimson Tide freshman quarterback Tua Tagovailoa had his moment in the search spotlight this week. After leading his team to an overtime victory in the College Football Playoff National Championship, searches for his name increased nearly 7,000 percent, and searches are interested in his names, his stats, and his hands (which are reportedly quite large, and were searched 450 percent more than famously large-handed NFL quarterback Russell Wilson).Ice skating turns up Search interest in figure skater Jimmy Ma jumped 1,300 percent this week after he brought hip hop to the ice skating rink. His routine at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships featured Lil Jon’s hit song “Turn Down for What,” prompting these top searches: “Jimmy Ma freestyle,” “Jimmy Ma goes viral,” and “Jimmy Ma hiphop ice skating routine.”What happens in Vegas … Will stay in tech news. The Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which showcases future tech products, took place in Las Vegas this week. Some technical difficulties meant that “CES power outage” was searched 150 percent more than “CES news.” Other top searches about the event were “When is CES 2018?” “What does CES stand for?” and “How to go to CES.”"

Despite a heightened desire to hit the gym, interest in “new year diet” was 200 percent higher than “new year exercise” this week. Looking ahead to the new year, people are wondering: “What is a New Year’s resolution for kids?” “What is the history behind New Year’s resolutions?” and “Who made the first New Year’s resolution?”Do you wanna build a snowman?“What is a bomb cyclone?” was a top-searched question this week as a massive winter storm hits the east coast of the U.S. Snow is showing up in unexpected places around the country as well. When people search for “Snow in...” the post popular locations are Florida, Tallahassee and Orlando. And with cold weather taking over, search interest in “frozen pipes” has reached its highest point this week since 2004.

See what this year’s biggest crazes were, through the lens of Google Search:Unicorn everything The unofficial mascot of 2017 was the unicorn—the magical creature that had the internet abuzz. While we may have reached peak Unicorn with Starbucks’ Unicorn Frappuccino, the craze didn’t stop there. People gave a unicorn twist to all kinds of foods and searched for unicorn cake, unicorn hot chocolate, unicorn cheesecake and unicorn lemonade. While this colorful trend spanned the globe, the most searches came from the cities of San Francisco, New York, London and Bengaluru. Those who jumped on the unicorn food train were likely responsible for making “How many calories are in a Unicorn Frappuccino?” the number one trending calorie-related query.",
            "Slimy searchesSlime also had a very big year: “How to make slime?” was the number one globally trending “how to make” question of 2017. We wanted to know how to make slime of all types: fluffy, butter, stretchy, jiggly, cloud, clear and glow-in-the-dark. But as our slimy obsession grew, so did its mess. “How to get slime out of carpet?” made its way to one of the 100 globally trending “How to” questions of the year. The dog days aren’t overWhile unicorns and slime may be have had their five minutes of fame, some internet loves last forever—like our collective adoration of cute creatures. This year’s most searched celebrity animal was April, the mama giraffe that gained worldwide fame after a live video stream of her pregnancy. April’s moment in the spotlight had the question “How long are giraffes pregnant for?” trending in Alaska. Next up in top-searched celebrity animals was Fiona, the premature baby hippo, followed by Marnie, the Instagram-famous senior rescue dog. Meme, myself and IFrom a dancing hot dog to a distracted boyfriend, the viral images that graced our feeds brought comedic relief, heavy doses of sarcasm and unending creativity to the internet. According to search data, the five most trending memes of 2017 were: “Cash Me Outside,” “United Airlines,” “Elf on the Shelf,” “What in Tarnation?” and “Mocking SpongeBob” as people sought to get in on the joke.Say what?It’s not just memes—the internet has a language of its own that can leave people asking “huh?”. Thankfully, the internet is also a helpful tool to quickly decode the latest slang. Trending acronyms we had to look up this year included WCW (woman crush wednesday), TFW (that feeling when), STG (swear to God), GOAT (greatest of all time), and OFC (of course). And from “What does despacito mean?” to “What does bodak yellow mean?” to “What does bibia be ye ye mean?”, we searched for the meanings of popular songs—then got back to the dance floor. And those are the wacky, weird and unexpected searches of 2017. Who knows what 2018 will bring? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"

Here’s a look at some of the trending searches about space in 2017:",
            "Steal my sunshine In August, a total solar eclipse crossed North America for the first time in over a century. The awe-inspiring event spurred a spike in eclipse-related questions, like “how long will the eclipse last?” and “how much of the eclipse will I see?” Safety was also top of mind: Beforehand, searches for “how to make solar eclipse glasses” and “how long you can look at the sun” were trending. Despite the preparation, the top post-eclipse queries were related to “eclipse eye damage”—yikes!Totality hits Eclipse-viewing experiences need a proper soundtrack.

These are the women, both famous and unknown, who launched a movement against sexual harassment this year. Searchers were most curious about “how the TIME Person of the Year is chosen,” and the top searches for “Person of the Year” were Ashley Judd, Donald Trump, Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud, Taylor Swift and Colin Kaepernick.Coding craze“Why do we need to learn coding?” was a top-searched question this week, and one that  Computer Science Education Week set out to answer. Searches about computer science ranged from basic questions like “What is coding” and “How to code,” to more advanced searches for programming languages (the most-searched languages were JavaScript, PHP and Python).That’s a wrap This week, Spotify released its “Wrapped” feature, which breaks down your music-listening habits over the past year. Spotify listeners wanted to know, “How to see Spotify 2017 Wrapped” and “How many songs have I listened to on Spotify?” The feature also tells you the number of minutes you spent listening to Spotify this year—and interestingly, search interest in “minutes to hours” went up 140 percent after Wrapped was released.No more carbo-loadingSome people may already be thinking about New Year’s resolutions, with a recent uptick in searches for the Keto diet, which recommends fewer carbs and more fats. For some, carbs (or lack thereof) are top of mind: “How to make Keto bread” and “How many carbs can I have on Keto diet” were two of the top searches. Those who are ready to get cooking searched for “Keto chicken recipes” and “Keto dessert recipes.” And if Keto isn’t your thing, consider the other most-searched diets this week: Paleo diet, Military diet, and Mediterranean diet."

            "I got into coding through classical music. When I studied it in college, I worked with a researcher who found a way to represent the notation of a large number of musical works digitally. I learned to code by doing various analyses to find patterns that automatically identified specific composers. These programs could distinguish between a Haydn and a Mozart piano sonata, which many musicians can’t even do. Once I saw the power of this skill, I had to learn more! I started taking some computer science (CS) classes, and ended up changing direction entirely from music to CS.Now, as a VP in Engineering at Google, I work to close the gaps that exist in CS education and access (only 40% of U.S. schools offer CS classes and many kids from underrepresented backgrounds still don’t feel that CS is for them). To combat that, we’ve created programs like CS First and Made With Code that expose kids to computer science and computational thinking at an early age (rather than discovering it later in life like I did), and help them develop those critical skills. And once a year, we rally around Computer Science Education Week, a celebration to inspire students and educators to get excited about where CS can take them (hint: anywhere) and take that first step in learning to code. Since CSEdWeek started back in 2013, we’ve been a proud partner, reaching more than 15 million students and supporting 35,000+ events each year.Our support continues this year, and we’re doing a lot to celebrate. Today’s homepage features the first-ever interactive coding-themed Doodle for kids, called “Coding for Carrots.” Anyone can try it out by using a simple programming language to solve puzzles. The code continues with an activity from CS First that lets you make your own custom Google logo, or you can try a holiday-themed emoji project from Made with Code.",
            "I hope these activities help kids realize that it’s easy to give coding a try, because so many things in world—from a movie to an amusement park ride—started with code. I wrote about this in a StoryWeaver story called “Coding is Everywhere,” illustrated by my fellow Googler Ma'ayan Rosenzweig. If more kids learned how to code, think about how many cool things we could build!",

People searched to find out more about Lauer and Keillor’s accusers, and details about the complaints. Following the news, search interest in Lauer’s former “Today Show” co-host Katie Couric went up 1,700 percent and interest in current co-host Savannah Guthrie went up nearly 500 percent.I now pronounce you prince and princess Prince Harry is officially off the market, now engaged to American actress Meghan Markle. In the U.S., people are wondering how it all started—the top searched question about the engagement was “Who introduced Prince Harry to Meghan?” But people in the U.K. are looking ahead to wedding day, searching to find out “Will we get a day off when Prince Harry gets married?” And everyone wants to know how much Markle’s ring will sparkle—this week’s “engagement ring” searches were all related to to Harry’s bride-to-be.Give a little bit Last week was all about eating, and this week was all about giving. People searched for organizations to donate to this Giving Tuesday—the top searched philanthropic organizations were Habitat for Humanity, Goodwill and Salvation Army. Other top questions about charity and philanthropy were “where to donate clothes,” “how to start a nonprofit” and “how to start a GoFundMe page.”Sneeze season Early estimates show that Australia's flu vaccine was only 10 percent effective at preventing the this year’s strain of the virus, leading to searches in the U.S. like “How effective is the 2017 flu vaccine?” and “What are the ingredients in a flu shot?” Earlier this week, “flu shot” was searched 220 percent more than “flu symptoms,” as some people are still looking to get a shot—another top search was “How much is the flu shot at CVS?” Top regions searching for influenza vaccine were Connecticut, North Dakota and South Dakota.Heads or tails?Search interest in “bitcoin” reached an all-time high in the U.S. this week, as prices peaked. But questions remain about this cryptic cryptocurrency—top searches were “What is bitcoin?” “How to buy Bitcoin” and “How to invest in Bitcoin.” Other than bitcoin, top searched cryptocurrencies were Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin."

            "Set the table and pour yourself a glass. It’s time to talk about your top Thanksgiving recipes and questions according to Google Search. Though it might not be as subject to debate as some conversations you have at your family table, there’s plenty of variety when it comes to our national menus this holiday. Whet your appetite. Everyone has a strategy for saving maximum stomach space for mashed potatoes, gravy and stuffing on Turkey Day. But while the turkey roasts and the drinks are served, you might be in need of a snack. Enter deviled eggs, the #3 searched recipe in the U.S. last Thanksgiving Day. If you’re in Ohio, you might go a bit bigger with a seven-layer salad. This fruit-based dish is uniquely highly searched in the Buckeye state. Now for the main course. Turkey, of course, is the centerpiece dish on most Thanksgiving tables: The answer to one of your top searched questions, “How many turkeys are consumed on Thanksgiving?” is somewhere around 45 million. Now it’s just a question of how to do it. On Thanksgiving Day last year, the top searched Thanksgiving question was “How long to cook a turkey?” The answer depends in part on how you do it; although roasting is common, there were more questions about brining and smoking on the day preceding Thanksgiving. And as the clock ticks by on the day itself, people may find themselves looking for a faster method. That’s when questions like “How long to fry a turkey” and “How to deep fry a turkey” creep into the top 10 searches.",
            "And it may be controversial to suggest a turkey-free table, but if anyone’s doing it might be Californians. Excluding turkey, the top searched Thanksgiving recipe in every state is either green bean casserole or sweet potato casserole—except in the Golden State, where it’s honey baked ham. Nobody puts side dishes in the corner. But let’s be real. Most of us are in it for the sides. Many households are breaking out the fried onions and marshmallows to make green bean casserole—the most popular side dish in 26 states—and sweet potato casserole, respectively.",
            "But there’s a huge variety when it comes to side dishes, which you can see when looking at the dishes that are uniquely highly searched across states. Examples of these dishes include mac and cheese in Tennessee, collard greens in Maryland and acorn squash in New York. Corn is popular in many places and many forms—casserole in Iowa, pudding in North Carolina and Virginia, and souffle in Florida. Kentucky, Texas and West Virginia are eating their greens, with broccoli casserole, broccoli rice casserole and broccoli salad, respectively. In Oregon and South Dakota, you might find ambrosia salad on your plate.Sometimes there may be just a difference in vocabulary. Though sweet potatoes are popular across states, in Kansas, Louisiana and Utah, yams were uniquely highly searched. You know what they say: I yam therefore I yam.  There’s always room for dessert. Pumpkin spice everything! Pumpkin is the most searched pie type in nearly 30 states, followed by sweet potato and, in a distant third, pecan. There’s one true outlier: in Maine, chocolate cream pie takes the, um, cake.",
            "But no one has just one pie on their table, right? (Right?) Across states, there’s more variety in the #2 and #3 searched pies, including apple, banana cream and even buttermilk and peanut butter. And pie might not be the apple of some states’ eye. In Arizona, the most uniquely highly searched dish is actually pumpkin roll, a cream-cheese filled dessert.Now that you’ve eaten your fill and given thanks, it’s time to clean up and ask one last question: “What to do with Thanksgiving leftovers?”Top questions and most popular searches are based on data from 2016. Unique searches are based on aggregated data from 2015, 2016 and 2017 (so far)."

Indeed, Black Friday searches containing “best” have more than doubled over the past two years on mobile.

What’s hot on the list this year  As always, there's a new crop of gifts climbing the trends chart. Here's a look at popular searches going into Black Friday: Classic apparel brands like Vans, Canada Goose and Nike Air Jordan Retro 11Celebrity-backed products like Kevin Durant’s Nike KD 10, Pharrell x adidas and Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty Gifts for gamers, including Razer phones, Nintendo Switch, and Call of Duty WW2Get the shopping scoop in a snap To help you search for gifts on the go, we recently redesigned mobile shopping on Google, bringing more product information to the forefront.

If you find yourself looking for something at the last minute, try using your Google Assistant to see where you can purchase needed items nearby by saying “Ok Google, where can I buy…”, or to get it sent right to your doorstep by saying “Ok Google, buy…”. Heading into the holidays, we see people with a Google Home device—which enables voice shopping with the Google Assistant—are using their voice to most frequently buy or add everyday essentials like paper towels or pet food to their shopping lists. We’re also seeing people using voice to find other types of products to prep for the holidays —including kitchen tools like basting brushes to perfectly glaze those Thanksgiving dishes, toys to slip under the tree, or fuzzy blankets to keep warm by the fireplace.Whether you’re researching on your phone or shopping with your voice, we wish you happy deal-hunting this holiday season!"

Pumpkin pie dominates searches in the U.S., but pecan pie is more popular in the southeast and apple pie is the state favorite in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. A smoked turkey is popular in most states, though some contend it should be roasted, fried or grilled. And Friendsgiving continues to rise in popularity, with searches like “friendsgiving ideas,” “friendsgiving invitations” and “friendsgiving games.”We’ll never let go Two decades ago, “Titanic” left an iceberg-sized hole in our hearts, and now it’s coming back to theaters in honor of its 20-year anniversary. In the years since its debut, search interest in “Titanic” reached its highest point globally in April 2012 when Titanic in 3D was released.

Lamborghini gifted the pope a special edition luxury car, which he decided to auction off for charity. Though the pope is known for his affinity for Fiats, interest in “Pope Lamborghini” zoomed 190 percent higher than “Pope Fiat.” People also searched to find out, “Why did the Lamborghini company give the pope a car?” and “How much does the Lamborghini that they gave the pope cost?”That’s a foulSearches for “UCLA basketball players” shot 330 percent higher this week when three players returned home after being arrested for shoplifting while on tour with the team in China.

            "Every day approximately 50,000 web pages filled with information come online—ranging from the weird, the wonderful and the wacky to the serious, the subjective, and the spectacular. With a plethora of choices out there, we rely on algorithms to sort and rank all this information to help us find content that is authoritative and comes from credible sources. A constantly changing web means we won’t ever achieve perfection, but we’re investing in helping people understand what they’re reading by providing visual signposts and labels.  We add clear labelling to stories in Google News (e.g., opinion, local, highly cited, in depth), and over year ago we launched the Fact Check tag globally in Google News and Search. And just recently we added information to our Knowledge Panels to help people get a quick insight into publishers.Today, we’re announcing a move toward a similar labeling effort by the Trust Project, which is hosted at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. The Project, which is funded by Google among others, has been working with more than 75 news organizations from around the world to come up with indicators to help people distinguish the difference between quality journalism and promotional content or misinformation.In a first step, the Project has released eight trust indicators that newsrooms can add to their content. This information will help readers understand more about what type of story they’re reading, who wrote it, and how the article was put together. These eight indicators include:Best Practices: Who funds the news outlet and their mission, plus an outlet’s commitments to ethics, diverse voices, accuracy, making corrections, and other standards.Author Expertise: Details about the journalist, including their expertise and other stories they have worked on.Type of Work: Labels to distinguish opinion, analysis, and advertiser (or sponsored) content from news reports.Citations and References: For investigative or in-depth stories, access to the sources behind the facts and assertions in a news story.Methods: For in-depth stories, information about why reporters chose to pursue a story and how they went about the process.Locally Sourced: Lets people know that the story has local roots, origin, or expertise.Diverse Voices: A newsroom’s efforts to bring in diverse perspectives.Actionable Feedback: A newsroom’s efforts to engage the public in setting coverage priorities, contributing to the reporting process, and ensuring accuracy.",
            "News publishers embed markup from schema.org into the HTML code of their articles and on their website. When tech platforms like Google crawl the content, we can easily parse out the information (such as Best Practices, Author Info, Citations & References, Type of Work). This works like the ClaimReview schema tag we use for fact-checking articles. Once we’ve done that, we can analyze the information and present it directly to the user in our various products.Our next step is to figure out how to display these trust indicators next to articles that may appear on Google News, Google Search, and other Google products where news can be found. Some possible treatments could include using the “Type of Work” indicator to improve the accuracy of article labels in Google News, and indicators such as “Best Practices” and “Author Info” in our Knowledge Panels. We believe this is a great first step for the Trust Project and look forward to future efforts as well."

            "When you’re searching on Google, we aim to provide the most useful results for your query. Today, around one in five searches on Google is related to location, so providing locally relevant search results is an essential part of serving you the most accurate information. In order to provide this optimal experience, your location determines the country service you receive results for across Google Search and Maps. Historically, these services have been labeled and accessed via country code top level domain names (ccTLD) such as [google.ng for Nigeria] or [google.com.br for Brazil]. You may also have typed in the relevant ccTLD in your browser. Today, we’ve updated the way we label country services on the mobile web, the Google app for iOS, and desktop Search and Maps. Now the choice of country service will no longer be indicated by domain. Instead, by default, you’ll be served the country service that corresponds to your location. So if you live in Australia, you’ll automatically receive the country service for Australia, but when you travel to New Zealand, your results will switch automatically to the country service for New Zealand. Upon return to Australia, you will seamlessly revert back to the Australian country service.",
            "If for some reason you don't see the right country when you're browsing, you can still go into settings and select the correct country service you want to receive. Typing the relevant ccTLD in your browser will no longer bring you to the various country services—this preference should be managed directly in settings. In addition, at the bottom of the search results page, you can clearly see which country service you are currently using.",
            "It’s important to note that while this update will change the way Google Search and Maps services are labeled, it won’t affect the way these products work, nor will it change how we handle obligations under national law. This update will help ensure that you get the most relevant results based on your location and is consistent with how Google already manages our services across a number of our other platforms, including YouTube, Blogger, Google Earth and Gmail, among others. We’re confident this change will improve your Search experience, automatically providing you with the most useful information based on your search query and other context, including location."

That’s why a year ago, we introduced a new feature called the Fact Check tag, as a way to show people when a news publisher or fact check organization has verified or debunked a claim, statistic or statement.",
            "Today, thousands of fact check articles appear on Google in Search results, on Google News, and across the open web. Fact checking articles—when a journalist looks at one single statement or issue and either verifies or debunks it—is important in today's climate because it helps readers better understand viral news stories and relevant issues. That’s why we’re supporting the organizations who do the hard work of fact checking so that we can make it available in Google Search. Today we’re announcing a new partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) at The Poynter Institute. As a nonpartisan organization, IFCN is committed to promoting excellence in fact checking and building a community of fact checkers around the world. IFCN has developed a widely accepted Code of Principles for fact check organizations. Signatories range from the Associated Press to the Washington Post, PolitiFact and Factcheck.org, to Correctiv (Germany), Aos Fatos (Brazil), and Africa Check. Our partnership with IFCN will focus on these key areas with a global point of view:Increasing the number of verified fact checkers through a combination of efforts, ranging from holding global fact check workshops to offering coaching and stipends for new fact checking organizations. Ultimately, these partners can help make sure that the content on Google Search and Google News has been accurately fact checked.Expanding fact checking to more regions by translating the Code of Principles into ten languages and ensuring credible fact checkers can apply to participate in the IFCN community.Providing fact-checking tools, at no cost, to the IFCN community. We’ll also offer trainings and access to an engineering time bank. Volunteer engineers will attend the annual Global Fact-Checking Summit to spend a day helping fact checkers develop software solutions to boost their impact or gain other efficiencies.Through partnerships with organizations like the IFCN, we hope this gives people a better understanding of the information they are about to click on online."

Sing us a lullaby, you’re the Piano Man Search interest in “Billy Joel age” went up nearly 8,000 percent this week after it was announced that the 68-year-old musician and his wife Alexis are expecting a child. Age was top of mind in the other searches as well: people asked “How old is Billy Joel’s wife?” and “How old is Billy Joel’s daughter?” as well as “How many children does Billy Joel have?” I scream, you scream, we all search for the Museum of Ice CreamAfter it it was reported that sprinkles from San Francisco’s Museum of Ice Cream (the interactive, social media-friendly art installation that’s already swept Los Angeles) have been found all around the city, search interest in “Museum of Ice Cream” rose nearly 5,00 percent. People are searching for the scoop: “How much are Museum of Ice Cream tickets?” “Who created the Museum of Ice Cream?” and “How to start something like the Museum of Ice Cream?” (Apparently it takes a lot of sprinkles.) And while we’re dishing out the ice cream trends ... the top-searched types of ice cream this week were “rolled ice cream,” “mochi ice cream,” and “vegan ice cream.” NBA season tips offAfter Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward fell to the floor with a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle on Wednesday (the first night of the NBA season), people searched: “How long will Gordon Hayward be out?” “How long does a fractured ankle take to heal?” and “How long is Gordon Hayward’s contract with the Celtics?” After the injury, search interest in Gordon Hayward shot up nearly 52,000 percent—making him the most searched NBA player on opening night (followed by LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Steph Curry). Let them eat (10-foot) cake Rapper Gucci Mane had an extravagant wedding this week, and the highlight was a 10-foot-tall $75,000 cake, prompting people to search: “How much was Gucci Mane’s wedding?” “Where was Gucci Mane’s wedding?” and “Who was at Gucci Mane’s wedding?” (Hopefully enough people to eat all that cake.) While the decadent dessert may have raised questions about the rapper’s fortune, interest in “Gucci Mane wedding” was searched 2.5 times more than “Gucci Mane net worth.” I’m feeling spookyIn the weeks leading up to Halloween, some have existential questions about the holiday (the top searched question was ”Why do people wear costumes for Halloween?”), while others are focused on finding the perfect costume: “What should I be for Halloween?” “How to make a Halloween costume?” and “What is the most popular Halloween costume?” We’ve got the last question covered—Google’s Frightgeist can tell you what people around the country or in your own hometown are searching for this Halloween."

But Selena’s influence in my life goes so much further than that.",

She showed me that my hybrid cultural identity was a valuable gift I should embrace. Watching her made me proud to be Mexicana.",

Among many notable accomplishments throughout her career, she consistently stayed at the top of the billboard charts, and won a Grammy for best Mexican-American album of 1993—making her the first female and youngest Tejano artist to win the award. But she was much more than a talented musician and entertainer. A fashionista and trendsetter, she often designed and created entire outfits for her performance wardrobe. In her free time, she was active in community service, and a strong advocate for education.",

            "Here are a few of the week’s most searched trends, with data from the Google News Lab.  California wildfires On Sunday night, devastating wildfires began in Sonoma and other parts of California, causing tens of thousands of people to evacuate and killing at least 30. While emergency responders are still working to contain the fires, people searched for more information: “Where are the California wildfires?” “When did the California wildfires start?” and “What areas of California are affected by the wildfires?” Top searches related specifically to wildfire were “How to stop wildfires, “How to help California wildfire victims,” and “How to deal with wildfire smoke.” Searches in California for “air quality” increased 2,200 percent this week. Harvey Weinstein “Who is Harvey Weinstein?” was a top searched question this week, after an overwhelming number of women in Hollywood spoke out against the Hollywood producer, sharing their stories of assault and harassment. Of the women who went public, Rose McGowan, Asia Argento, Ashley Judd and Ambra Battilana Gutierrez were the most searched. Now free to roam the islands Southwest Airlines announced this week that it’s expanding its service to Hawaii starting in 2018. Those who “Wanna Get Away” are searching, “When does the Southwest sale end?” “How often does Southwest have sales?” and “When does Southwest start flying to Hawaii?” Planning their next vacation, the states searching the most for Southwest Airlines this week were Nevada, Arizona and Colorado. Kicked out On Tuesday the U.S. Men’s National Soccer team lost to Trinidad and Tobago and failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup tournament. Search interest in U.S. Men’s Soccer spiked by 480 percent on the day of the defeat, and the most searched teams this week were from Argentina, the U.S. and Ecuador. Soccer fans searched to find out how and where to watch the U.S. vs Trinidad and Tobago game, as well as “What happened to the US men’s soccer team?” Bundle up Pizza Hut is adding a topper to your winter outfit with its new Pizza Parka, a real jacket made of the same materials as their new pizza pie delivery pouch. Pizza lovers must know “How to win a Pizza Hut parka,” “How to purchase a Pizza Hut parka” and “How much is Pizza Hut’s parka?” If this put you in the mood for pizza, we can deliver—the most-searched pizza toppings this week were chicken, pepperoni, tomato, sausage and garlic."

            "Every week, we share a glimpse of what people are searching for on Google, with data from the Google News Lab. Here are a few of this week's top trends:  Las VegasMany are still coming to terms with the tragic Las Vegas shooting that claimed the lives of 59 people and injured hundreds more. A few of the most-searched questions about the shooting were “What gun was used in the Las Vegas shooting?” “How long did the Las Vegas shooting last?” and “How many people died in the Las Vegas shooting?” After the shooting occurred, search interest in “gun control” went up more than 3000 percent, compared to the previous week.Saying goodbye to a legendIconic guitarist Tom Petty passed away this week. When the news broke, people searched “Is Tom Petty really dead?” “How old was Tom Petty?” and “Why did Tom Petty die?” Meanwhile, search interest in “Tom Petty songs” reached an all-time high. On the day of his death, the artist’s most searched songs were “Free Fallin,’” “Wildflowers,” “American Girl,” “I Won’t Back Down,” and “Home.”Give the people what they wantMcDonald’s is bringing back its famed szechuan sauce—originally introduced for a limited time in 1998—after it was the subject of a “Rick and Morty” episode back in April. Fans of the show and the sauce are searching “Which McDonald’s have szechuan sauce?” “When does szechuan sauce come back?” and “Is szechuan sauce good?” Search interest in Rick and Morty’s “‘Szechuan sauce episode” dipped 780 percent lower than “Szechuan sauce locations.” Other top searched dipping sauces from McDonald’s include honey mustard, Sriracha Mac Sauce and spicy buffalo.Not loving this one “Love is not an ingredient.” This was a top search this week, and apparently the FDA agrees. They told a bakery in Massachusetts to remove “love” from its list of ingredients in a popular brand of bread for fear of “deceptive labeling.” Love may not be allowed on the ingredient label,  but other top trending ingredients this week were szechuan sauce (thanks, McDonald’s), mooncake ingredients, shepherd’s pie ingredients, and Hollandaise ingredients.Sky aglow This Thursday marked the first October Harvest Moon since 2009, and the next one is predicted to reappear in 2020. People searched to find out when the October Harvest Moon was happening, how to see it and “what planets are surrounding the October Harvest Moon?” The top regions searching for October Harvest Moon were Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon."

            "Journalism provides accurate and timely information when it matters most, shaping our understanding of important issues and pushing us to learn more in search of the truth. People come to Google looking for high-quality content, and our job is to help them find it. However, sometimes that content is behind a paywall.While research has shown that people are becoming more accustomed to paying for news, the sometimes painful process of signing up for a subscription can be a turn off. That’s not great for users or for news publishers who see subscriptions as an increasingly important source of revenue.To address these problems we’ve been talking to news publishers about how to support their subscription businesses with a focus on the following:First, Flexible Sampling will replace First Click Free. Publishers are in the best position to determine what level of free sampling works best for them. So as of this week, we are ending the First Click Free policy, which required publishers to provide a minimum of three free articles per day via Google Search and Google News before people were shown a paywall.Longer term, we are building a suite of products and services to help news publishers reach new audiences, drive subscriptions and grow revenue.We are also looking at how we can simplify the purchase process and make it easy for Google users to get the full value of their subscriptions across Google’s platforms.Our goal is to make subscriptions work seamlessly everywhere, for everyone.First Click FreeWe will end our First Click Free policy in favor of a Flexible Sampling model where publishers will decide how many, if any, free articles they want to provide to potential subscribers based on their own business strategies. This move is informed by our own research, publisher feedback, and months-long experiments with the New York Times and the Financial Times, both of which operate successful subscription services.  \"Google's decision to let publishers determine how much content readers can sample from search is a positive development,” said Kinsey Wilson, an adviser to New York Times CEO Mark Thompson. \"We're encouraged as well by Google's willingness to consider other ways of supporting subscription business models and we are looking forward to continuing to work with them to craft smart solutions.\"Publishers generally recognize that giving people access to some free content is the way to persuade people to buy their product. The typical approach to sampling is a model called metering, which lets people see a pre-determined number of free stories before a paywall kicks in. We recommend the following approach:Monthly, rather than daily, metering allows publishers more flexibility to experiment with the number of free stories to offer people and to target those more likely to subscribe.For most publishers, 10 articles per month is a good starting point.Please see our Webmaster blog and our guide on Flexible Sampling for more detail on these approaches.“Try before you buy” underlines what many publishers already know—they need to provide some form of free sampling to be successful on the internet. If it’s too little, then fewer users will click on links to that content or share it, which could have an effect on brand discovery and subsequently may affect traffic over time.Subscription supportSubscribing to great content should not be as hard as it is today. Registering on a site, creating and remembering multiple passwords, and entering credit card information—these are all hassles we hope to solve.As a first step we’re taking advantage of our existing identity and payment technologies to help people subscribe on a publication’s website with a single click, and then seamlessly access that content anywhere— whether it’s on that publisher site or mobile app, or on Google Newsstand, Google Search or Google News.And since news products and subscription models vary widely, we’re collaborating with publishers around the world on how to build a subscription mechanism that can meet the needs of a diverse array of approaches—to the benefit of the news industry and consumers alike.  We’re also exploring how Google’s machine learning capabilities can help publishers recognize potential subscribers and present the right offer to the right audience at the right time.“It's extremely clear that advertising alone can no longer pay for the production and distribution of high quality journalism—and at the same time the societal need for sustainable independent journalism has never been greater.  Reader-based revenue, aka paid-content, or subscription services, are therefore not just a nice-to-have, but an essential component of a publisher's revenue composition,” said Jon Slade, FT Chief Commercial Officer.“The Financial Times is welcoming of Google's input and actions to help this critical sector of the media industry, and we've worked very closely with Google to aid understanding of the needs that publishers have and how Google can help. That mutual understanding includes the ability to set controls over the amount of free content given to readers, a level playing field for content discovery, optimised promotion and payment processes. It is important that we now build and accelerate on the discussions and actions to date.”  We are just getting started and want to get as much input from publishers—large, small, national, local, international—to make sure we build solutions together that work for everyone."

And as Puerto Rico reels from the devastation of Hurricane Maria, people want to know how they can help. Here are the top trends of the week, with data from Google News Lab.",
            "Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico continues to grapple with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which left many without power and desperate for food, electricity and communication services. People in the U.S. continue to search for “hurricane donation” (interest went up 185% this week), as well as “How powerful was Hurricane Maria?” “How to donate to Puerto Rico” and “What is the Jones Act?” (A law that was waived to get relief to Puerto Rico quicker). The top regions searching for Puerto Rico were Florida, Connecticut and New Jersey.Caffeine fiendsWake up and smell the coffee—it’s National Coffee Day! And everyone is after the free java, with searches like, “Is Starbucks doing anything for National Coffee Day?” “Who gives free coffee on National Coffee Day?” and “What is National Coffee Day at Dunkin Donuts?” Cold brew coffee, butter coffee, and Irish coffee (for those starting early…) are the most searched types of coffee this week.RIP HefHugh Hefner passed away this week at the age of 91. Upon hearing the news, people searched to find out more about Hefner’s fortune and infamous love life: “How much was Hugh Hefner worth?” “Who gets Hugh Hefner’s money?” and “Who was Hugh Hefner married to?” Hefner will be buried next to Marilyn Monroe, Playboy’s first cover girl (search interest in Monroe went up 570% this week as well).But will they assemble the meatballs, too?This week, two of the top searched questions about IKEA were: “How to build IKEA Tarva nightstand” and “How to remove IKEA drawer front.” Well, now you can get some help with that. This week, IKEA closed a deal to buy the online errand company TaskRabbit so that the dreaded phrase “assembly required” will become slightly less scary. Those who are keen on IKEA are searching the most for dressers, desks, rugs, kitchen cabinets and beds.Riding in styleFord is getting revved up with its new F-450 Super Duty Limited truck, which can cost as much as $100,000 and tows 15 tons … talk about luxury. Search interest for the new truck went into overdrive—“Ford Truck” was searched 2000% more than “Ford SUV.” People are doing their due diligence on the Super Duty, searching “Where is the F-250 Super Duty made?” “What is the MPG of a Ford Super Duty Diesel?” and “What roof bars fit a Ford Super Duty?”"

            "Update: As of October 2nd, we've increased our internal gift matching campaign, and will now give $1.5M to the organizations listed below for relief and recovery efforts for Hurricane Maria.Hurricane Maria recently made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, killing at least 10 people and leaving much of the island without power or water. Elsewhere in the Caribbean, millions more are looking to rebuild—the storm destroyed the island of Dominica, killing at least 15 people, and devastated the Dominican Republic, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Turks and Caicos.I was born and raised outside of San Juan, in a town called Cupey, and left the island to study in the States. Today, I still have family there, as well as in Barranquitas, towards the center of the island. The roof broke off my grandmother's terrace, a place filled with many memories of family gatherings growing up. My uncles, who are agricultural entrepreneurs in Barranquitas, were able to visit their land just yesterday and see the damage caused to their crops, completely turning their business upside down. I'm lucky that my family members are all safe, but the damage will still take years to repair.To help with the relief and recovery in Puerto Rico and beyond, Google.org and Googlers are committing $1 million in donations to organizations that are providing critical resources to the affected regions. To support immediate humanitarian needs, we’re distributing funds to organizations including the Red Cross, World Food Program, and UNICEF. We’re also supporting NetHope, which provides Internet access in the wake of natural disasters around the world, because connectivity can be a critical link in providing basic needs like food, water and medical care. This month has taxed the resources of first responder agencies across the region, and we want to make sure nonprofits like NetHope have the resources they need to respond to Hurricane Maria. We’ve also had a small team of engineers volunteer in the wake of recent Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, to help restore connectivity by setting up hot-spots and assisting with other technical needs that local nonprofits and shelters may have. We’re working with NetHope to find ways that our technical volunteers can be most helpful in Puerto Rico as well.Crisis Response and SOS AlertsIn times of crises, having access to timely safety information can be critical. Ahead of the storm, Google’s Crisis Response team launched SOS Alerts for Hurricane Maria. Although few people have connectivity in the storm’s wake, we’ve continued to update the alert with information on power outages, emergency information contacts, the damage to the Guajataca dam, and crisis maps in both English and Spanish. Those outside of the region can also find the latest news and information, as well as an easy way to donate to relief efforts, directly through Search.As the 2017 hurricane season has pummeled the U.S. and the Caribbean, Google.org, Google employees and the public have collectively donated $7 million for relief efforts in the areas affected by Harvey, Irma and Maria. My thoughts are with everyone in Puerto Rico and other affected areas, and it gives me solace to know that my colleagues and company are doing everything they can to help."

            "Each week, we take a look at the most-searched trends (with help and data from the team at Google News Lab). Here are a few top trends from this week:Mexico City earthquakeA fatal earthquake rocked Mexico City this week, and people turned to Google to find out how they can aid the recovery. Two of the top questions in the U.S. were “What fault line is Mexico City on?” and “Where to donate for the earthquake in Mexico?” Those questions were both in the top five searched questions in Mexico City as well, along with “What is needed in the shelters?” and “Where is the school that collapsed from the earthquake?”From court to screenWednesday marked the anniversary of the famed tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, and starting today, Emma Stone and Steve Carell portray them on the big screen. The release caused a racket in Search: Interest in “women’s tennis” spiked 140 percent higher than “men’s tennis.” (Game.) Billie Jean King was searched 230 percent more than Bobby Riggs. (Set.) And interest in Emma Stone was 290 percent higher than Steve Carell (match!).Demagor-gone searchingOne a scale from one to Eleven, how excited are you for “Stranger Things” season two? Unless you’ve been trapped in the Upside Down, you know that the show is coming back soon.

It may have lost to “Handmaid’s Tale” at the Emmy’s, but it’s spooking the competition in other ways—“Stranger Things costume” was searched 1,040 percent more than “Handmaid’s Tale costume” in the last week. There’s only a few weeks to go, so get your Eggos ready.Will it be a Graceful comeback?Fans thought they said goodbye to “Will & Grace” in 2006 but now they’re searching, “What time will Will & Grace be on Hulu?” That’s right, the beloved NBC series is making a comeback on Hulu next week (all one hundred and ninety four episodes are now on Hulu as well). Other popular questions include, “How many episodes are there in Will & Grace season 1?” and “Is Leslie Jordan returning to the Will & Grace reboot?” (Karen Walker isn’t happy about that one.) There are a lot of “Will & Grace” lovers in Rhode Island, Iowa and North Dakota, the states that searched the most for the show this week. Flu fightersFlu season is around the corner, and people are aching to learn more. Search was congested with lots of queries, but the top ones were: “How long is a flu shot good for?” “How bad is flu season this year?” and “How to stay healthy during flu season? People are searching the most for “stomach flu,” followed by “keto flu.” Top regions searching for “flu season” were Delaware, North Carolina and Louisiana."

Search interest for Francia Raisa, Selena’s longtime friend who gave her the kidney, went up more than 9,000 percent this week.

The ESPN broadcaster made his Monday Night Football debut and stumbled through an awkward sideline report during the Broncos/Chargers game. Sergio’s tweet about newfound notoriety prompted us to look for other top searches about the topic of fame. Fame-seekers want to know “How to get Instagram famous,” “How did Adele become famous,” and “What is Benjamin Franklin famous for?” (One thing we know for sure: He did it without Instagram!)Let’s look at the (Equi)factsLast week’s Equifax data breach—which may have compromised the personal information of 143 million Americans—raised lots of questions about security. Search interest for “credit freeze” reached all an-time high this month, with related questions like, “What is the difference between a fraud alert and a security freeze?” and “How do I freeze my credit?” Specifically related to the Equifax breach, people are searching “How to find out if I was affected by Equifax?” and “How do I freeze my credit report Equifax?”Hispanic Heritage MonthToday is the first day of National Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration of people and cultures hailing from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and South America.

            "Hurricane IrmaIrma was on the minds of many throughout the week, as the hurricane devastated the Caribbean and headed toward the U.S. As Florida braces for impact, people are searching for how to prepare—top searches in Florida include “how to board up windows” and “how to install hurricane shutters.” Floridians are also searching for where they can stock up on supplies like sandbags and water. Across the U.S., top queries include, “Where has Hurricane Irma hit?” “How wide is the eye of Hurricane Irma?” and “How to volunteer for Hurricane Irma?”DACAPresident Trump’s administration rescinded DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which provides legal protection for immigrants—known as “Dreamers”—who came to the U.S. unlawfully as children. People searched for more information about the legislation, as well as information about how to take action. The top three questions about DACA were: “What to say to senators about DACA?” “When was DACA set to expire?” and “What do DACA recipients receive?” The top three states searching for DACA—Arizona, California and New Mexico—are ones with high populations of Dreamers.On a lighter noteThis week, celebrity news was ready to pop with baby announcements. Two celebrity couples—Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and Princess Kate and Prince William—are expecting baby number three. Top searches for Kim and Kanye were about Kim’s surrogate, and people wanted to know who the surrogate is, why they’re using one, and how much they’re paying her. As for William and Kate, people are curious about the ages of the parents as well as the ages of their babies. If all this baby talk has you wondering about popular names these days, the top searched baby names this week were James, Isabella and Michael. “Wow, in front of the Pope!” That’s how the head of the Catholic Church responded when a young man proposed to his girlfriend during a papal audience. Bold move. People were searching about the proposal and for other Pope-related information like, “How long has the Pope been the Pope?” and “What country did the Pope recently visit?” And speaking of proposals … the top “how to’s” related to proposals include: “How to know if you should propose, “How to get your boyfriend to propose,” and “How to tell if he’ll ever propose.” Not sure Google (or the Pope) can help answer that one. Roses are red, chocolates are ruby The final trend of the week ends on a sweet note. Swiss company Barry Callebaut debuted a new natural ruby-colored chocolate this week, and chocolate lovers must know: “Where to buy ruby chocolate? “What variety bean is used in ruby chocolate?” and “Is Ruby chocolate vegan?” Other than pink chocolate, top searched pink foods this week were “pink drink Starbucks,” “pink moscato” and “pink champagne.”"

People are searching for how to help, as well as for information about future storm Hurricane Irma—which was upgraded to a Category 3 and is moving across the Atlantic. The top queries regarding the storm were “How to donate clothes to Hurricane Harvey,” “How to help Houston,” and “How much money has been raised for Hurricane Harvey?”Search never felt so goodIf you were searching for Michael Jackson this week, You are Not Alone. It was the King of Pop’s birthday on Tuesday, and search interest in “Michael Jackson birthday” was 1,750% higher than “Michael Jackson songs.” Listening to his hits in honor of his birthday? I Can’t Help It either. Top-searched Michael Jackson songs were: “Bad,” “Billie Jean,” “Beat It,” “Smooth Criminal,” and “Man In The Mirror.” We’ve Got a Good Thing Going in Nevada, where the most searches for Michael Jackson occurred.XOXOThe iconic series “Gossip Girl” turns 10 this month. While Chuck Bass was the most searched character this week, Blake Lively was the most searched actor from Gossip Girl. Top searched questions about the show were: “Who is Gossip Girl?” (no spoilers here) “How many seasons of Gossip Girl are there?” (six) and “Who does Serena end up with on Gossip Girl?” (we said we’re not spoiling it!).Getting better with age A former Catholic monk has filed a lawsuit against L’Oréal, claiming that the company stole his patented formula for an anti-aging cream. One of the top related searches was “L'Oréal skin cream monk” (can’t say we’ve ever heard that phrase before), and the most search interest is coming from New Jersey. While we’re on the subject of beauty products, the top trending makeup searches from this week are “feather eyebrows,” “lipstick,\" “best foundation for oily skin,” “blush” and “makeup brushes.”It’s never too early The hallmark of the Fall season—pumpkin-spiced food and drinks—is officially back. Search interest in “pumpkin spice” spikes every September and October, and this week people were most interested to find out when the Pumpkin Spice Latte returns to Starbucks, and (the question on everybody’s mind), “Is it Pumpkin Spice Latte season?” The love for pumpkin spice goes beyond lattes: top searched pumpkin spice recipes this week were pumpkin spice cake, pumpkin spice cookies, pumpkin spice poke cake, and pumpkin spice muffins."

            "Every year, millions come to Google to search for news and information that helps illuminate the world around them. While people often search for breaking news, the latest sports scores, or what's playing at a local movie theater, they also often look for answers on how to fix the more mundane items around them.",
            "Recently, we noticed that “how to…” searches have increased by more than 140% since 2004, and much of that search interest is directed towards how to “fix” things—whether it’s a lightbulb, window, washing machine, or even the toilet. In fact, “How to fix…” is consistently near the top of the list of most common queries, year after year, around the world. That’s why the Google Trends team teamed up with award-winning designer Xaquín González Veira —formerly of “The Guardian”, “National Geographic” and “the New York Times”—to create our latest visual: How to fix a toilet...and other things you couldn’t do without Search.",
            "The first data visualization shows household items people ask Google how to fix, and how those searches vary by country. For instance, in the United States, the top “how to fix\" items are doors, followed by windows, toilets, washing machines and refrigerators. While in Japan, the order is:  windows, doors, washing machines, and toilets.",
            "Check out the map of the world below, to see how it shifts:",
            "Xaquin noticed some neat (and weird) patterns in the data. Searches for “how to fix a toilet” and “how to use chopsticks” follow a very similar pattern. Wonder why that is? Just check out the site. You’ll be surprised what tops the list in each country and which places need to fix the same things (washing machines in Russia and Colombia and windows in Brazil and Eritrea).",
            "The visual also showcases data for the top searched “how to’s” around the world. The top ten are:how to tie a tiehow to kisshow to get pregnanthow to lose weighthow to drawhow to make moneyhow to make pancakeshow to write a cover letterhow to make french toasthow to lose belly fatCheck out the interactive guide here, to explore more of this fascinating data.",
            "This data visualization is the latest in the Google News Lab’s series of collaborations with designers, working alongside the University of Miami’s Alberto Cairo to re-examine how news designers can tell stories using new types of data (including new sources of Google data)  and by experimenting with new kinds of data visualizations. You can see some more of the projects we’ve launched so far here.",

            "Update: In less than 24 hours, together we raised $2 million for Hurricane Harvey relief and recovery. Thanks to your donations, we have met our goal. However, the crisis isn’t over. Your contributions can still provide critical relief to those in need. Although Google is no longer matching donations, please consider giving directly to the Red Cross. The rain and destruction from Hurricane Harvey continue to affect people throughout Texas and the Gulf Coast, and with floodwaters continuing to rise, immediate action is needed. I’ve called Texas home since 1989, and I’m heartened to see how people are coming together to support each other during this crisis. Neighbors are rescuing one another, and people are bringing their boats and resources to save lives. I’m proud to work for a company that brings the best of its products, people, and philanthropy in times of need.On Sunday, we shared our efforts to give funds to organizations helping those affected, and provide resources through SOS Alerts and products. So far, we’ve committed $750K through Google.org and employee giving, and in total we are committing $2M from Google to relief efforts. Today, we’re expanding that support, and with your help, we can increase the impact. We’ve also continued to update our SOS Alerts and Crisis Map to make sure people in the affected areas are getting the most up-to-date information, directly from trusted sources.$1M Matching Campaign for the American Red CrossWe’re kicking off a matching campaign at https://www.google.org/harvey-relief to support the American Red Cross (ARC), and Google.org will match your donations up to $1,000,000. ARC is the leading nonprofit responder in the flood regions, and has been working tirelessly on the ground to open shelters and distribute supplies to people in Texas and across the Gulf coast.",
            "Google Trends have also shown us that people around the country want to support the relief effort, with top “How-to” questions including, “How to help Houston flood victims,” and “How to volunteer to help with Harvey.”With more than 450 Google employees based in Texas, we’re also committed to supporting Texas’s road to recovery with our volunteers. We’re working with local nonprofits to identify needs in the area and find ways our employees can be most helpful. We are exploring ways to support efforts of TEGNA—the state’s largest television station owner—with up to $500K in funds for the “Texas Cares” fundraising effort underway for Hurricane Harvey relief.SOS Alerts and Google Public AlertsSince Harvey made initial landfall, the Google Crisis Response team has been working to ensure people affected by the storm have access to timely, official information about the event. In addition to the previously launched SOS alert for Texas, now people have access to an SOS Alert for Houston, which includes Coast Guard rescue information and ready.gov safety tips for the flooding, along with local news, tweets, and other safety-oriented information. Additionally, people in affected areas can see published road closure and shelter information, sourced from users in the affected areas, along with recent aerial imagery of affected areas, as flown by NOAA. This information, in concert with official government alerts for the area being disseminated via Google Public Alerts we hope keeps users safe and informed during this trying crisis.With the storm making a second landfall, we are actively monitoring the storm and are preparing an alert for the coast of Louisiana.",

Combined, the bulk of these funds will support the American Red Cross, who has been working to provide shelter and basic services for those affected, as well as Save the Children, Habitat for Humanity, and Team Rubicon. With more than 450 Googlers who call Texas home and thousands of other employees connected to Texas, the impact of Hurricane Harvey on our state is personal to many of us. We have been coordinating closely with the federal government, the Office of the Governor, and local elected officials to support their efforts on the ground. While the needs of the state will be great in the weeks and months to come, we hope that these funds will help provide the necessary resources to the communities affected and further inspire others to donate as well. We will continue to keep the people of Texas in our thoughts."

With this in mind, today we’re bringing voice typing (aka talking to your phone instead of typing) to 30 new languages and locales around the world, covering more than a billion people. With this update, Google’s speech recognition supports 119 language varieties, in Gboard on Android, Voice Search and more. And now in the U.S. in English, you can use use voice dictation to express yourself with emoji.",
            "Bringing voice input to more global users To honor languages around the world, speech recognition will support ancient languages such as Georgian, which has an alphabet that dates back to the 10th century. We’re also adding Swahili and Amharic, two of Africa's largest languages, as well as many Indian languages on our quest to make the internet more inclusive.",
            "For your reference, here's the full list of newly supported languages and locales:Amharic (Ethiopia)Armenian (Armenia)Azerbaijani (Azerbaijan)Bengali (Bangladesh, India)English (Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania)Georgian (Georgia)Gujarati (India)Javanese (Indonesia)Kannada (India)Khmer (Cambodia)Lao (Laos)Latvian (Latvia)Malayalam (India)Marathi (India)Nepali (Nepal)Sinhala (Sri Lanka)Sundanese (Indonesia)Swahili (Tanzania, Kenya)Tamil (India, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Malaysia)Telugu (India)Urdu (Pakistan, India)",
            "To incorporate 30 new language varieties, we worked with native speakers to collect speech samples, asking them to read common phrases. This process trained our machine learning models to understand the sounds and words of the new languages and to improve their accuracy when exposed to more examples over time.",
            "These new languages are also available starting today in Cloud Speech API and will soon be available across other Google apps and products, including the Translate app. To enable Voice Typing in your keyboard, install Gboard from the Play Store and pick your language (press the G in the suggestion strip and select the Settings wheel). Then just tap the microphone to start speaking. To enable Voice Search, open the Google app and pick your language in the Voice settings menu (tap the top-left menu and go to Settings, then pick Voice and select your language).",

            "On August 11, 1973, there was a party at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx—and four decades later, we’re still talking about it. Today’s Google Doodle celebrates the 44th anniversary of that party, which is widely credited as the birth of the Hip Hop movement.",
            "To learn more about the Doodle and the movement that inspired it, the Keyword team chatted with three of the Googlers behind the Doodle—Kevin Burke, Ryan Germick and Perla Campos. We also talked with two legendary hip hop pioneers who served as close partners in the project: Fab 5 Freddy, former host of “Yo! MTV Raps” and narrator of the Doodle, and Cey Adams, visual artist and founding creative director of Def Jam records, who designed the Doodle logo image that you see on the homepage today. Here’s what they had to say.",
            "Keyword: How did you come up with the idea for this Doodle?Kevin: I’m a huge Hip Hop fan. Growing up outside New Orleans, it was a part of my DNA—performing Hip Hop in my high school band, adding Hip Hop to my college radio station’s rotation, and working on the set of Outkast’s “Ms. Jackson” music video in my first job out of college. Hip Hop has been a constant thread through my life and I wanted to bring my love of it to a Doodle. I developed the concept for interactive turntables, showed it to my manager Ryan (also a fan of Hip Hop), and he lost it. He said, “let’s make it tomorrow!”",
            "OK, so people were into the idea. But Hip Hop is such a big topic. How did you decide what to focus on?Perla: From the beginning, we were thinking big. I mean, Hip Hop touches so many parts of culture but a lot of people don’t know much about its origins. So, we anchored the Doodle to the birth of Hip Hop, and wanted to celebrate the people who pioneered the movement. We hope to give them the voice and the recognition they deserve, which is what Doodles are all about—shining light on times of history that maybe you didn’t know about.",
            "Kevin: It all started with DJ Kool Herc, an 18-year old Jamaican DJ in the Bronx. He and his sister threw a party in August 1973, and when he DJ’d the party, he used two turntables to extend the instrumental break in the music where people did their craziest dance moves (that’s actually how “break” dancing got its name!). And the Hip Hop movement was born.",
            "Ryan: With each Doodle, we try to touch a different part of the human experience. But we hadn’t yet touched on a massive part of U.S. and global culture—Hip Hop. And by bringing in elements like “Achievements,” we can also make it about the real people behind the Hip Hop movement.",
            "Speaking of the real people … Fab and Cey, how did you feel when you first heard about this project?Fab: It was a full circle experience for me. I first went online in 1994—I even remember doing a segment on “Yo! MTV Raps” about email. And going back to when I first got on the internet, I was looking for likeminded people who were part of the culture. And now, Hip Hop is on one of the biggest digital platforms out there, in a way that acknowledges and recognizes what this culture is, and what it continues to be. It’s pretty amazing.",
            "Cey: Everybody on this project was so excited to be a part of it, which made me excited too. I could add an authentic point of view and represent all the people who helped start the movement, even the ones who are no longer here. The project is rooted in honoring the past.",
            "The Doodle pays homage to many early pioneers of Hip Hop. How did you decide who to include?Perla: We started with a big list of people and narrowed it down based on a ton of research and conversations with close partners versed in all things Hip Hop—like Lyor Cohen, current head of YouTube music and a legend in the music industry who has signed some of the greatest Hip Hop artists ever. We also wanted to make sure we represented the diversity in Hip Hop and featured the women who were a huge part of the early days but often aren’t talked about.",
            "Kevin: Part of the Doodle is a “record crate” that has legendary samples you can listen to. You’ve probably heard these samples in a Jay-Z or Kanye West song but few people know who actually created them. Perla and I were in tears one day because we added a bunch of fresh beats from our childhood—the samples behind the Puff Daddy, Tupac and Notorious B.I.G. songs we loved growing up. We were totally going down memory lane.",
            "How does this compare to other Doodles?Perla: We’ve never done a Doodle like this before, both because of the technical challenges and the many voices and collaborators we wanted to include. It was both unnerving and exciting to tackle this because so many people have been touched by Hip Hop in some way—so how do you do it justice?",
            "Ryan: There’s a lot that went into figuring out what bitrate of audio you needed to scratch records, how to sync up the beats correctly, and the complexities around animations were firsts for us. We’re always trying to one-up ourselves, to exceed the expectations of people who love our Doodles. This one represented all the things Doodles are good at: storytelling, interactivity and education.",
            "How did you get into Hip Hop? What’s your earliest memory of Hip Hop?Kevin: I got a lot of exposure to Hip Hop growing up in Louisiana. I was this artist kid in a suburban conservative area—I identified with the spirit, angst and celebratory energy of Hip Hop. I’m also a music trivia nerd—when I was a kid, my dad would quiz me whenever a song came on the radio. I’ve tried to work that music trivia into this Doodle at every chance.",
            "Ryan: Hip Hop was part of the fabric of my upbringing. I grew up in suburban Indiana—in an environment dramatically different from the Bronx where Hip Hop was born—but as soon as we got cable, I started watching “Yo! MTV Raps.” One of the most exciting things about working on this Doodle was that we got to collaborate with people like Fab 5 Freddy and Prince Paul, one of my all-time favorite hip hop producers.",
            "Cey: One of my earliest memories is when I went to the Jamaica Armory to see Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. I realized that Hip Hop belonged to us—it was music for myself and my friends, something that nobody could take away from us.",
            "Fab: The guys who wanted to be DJs and rappers had this sense of wonder and energy about them. They were like engineers in the way they worked with their sound systems—the cables, the speakers, the amps. Those DJs were a bunch of smart cats figuring out something that was advanced and revolutionary during that time. I felt comfortable around them during a time when there was rough stuff going on in the streets.",
            "How do you view the evolution of Hip Hop over the last 44 years? Where is it going?Fab: The essence of Hip Hop culture at its base is like an algorithm—it can be done in any language and by any nationality out there, and when done right it grows exponentially. From the very beginnings in the 70s, this culture was generated by those who had very little, and took those bare essentials to say: “I’m here, I matter.” And that has reverberated continuously for decades. So I don’t like to think of old school vs. new school, I’m a “now school” person. Hip Hop marches on—it will always reinvent itself.",
            "Cey, you’ve worked as an artist for decades, across a huge variety of mediums. What was it like to design something for the Google homepage?Cey: Graffiti has always been associated with vandalism to some degree—in the early days, I had to tell people that my art was different from people who were just tagging. But we’re capital “A” artists. All we’re doing is using a spray can instead of a paintbrush. And now Google is putting this piece of art on the homepage, which will be seen by people all over the world. That’s really exciting to me.",
            "What do you hope the audience gets from this Doodle?Perla: My biggest aspiration for the Doodle is that people see themselves in it, that there’s something that speaks to and represents them on the Google homepage. Hip Hop originated as a way for young people to focus on something positive in the midst of the negative forces around them, so I want people to feel that same hope and positivity from this Doodle.",
            "Ryan: I hope people can cut through some of the negative stereotypes associated with Hip Hop —it’s not without its shortcomings but it’s such an important part of our culture. The Bronx was not an easy place to grow up in the 70’s, but such a vibrant culture was born out of it.",
            "Cey: I want people to get a Hip Hop education, and to understand that the music, the art, the dance, the fashion, it’s all part of a collective lifestyle of people who wanted to change their circumstances. And it will always be there—and will continue to spread around the world—because there’s always some young person who wants to change their circumstances.",
            "Fab: For those who have have grown up with this, they’re gonna be amazed to see such a huge part of their lives acknowledged. I want people to see that Hip Hop affects everybody, not just youth culture. It continues to be important, relevant and alive. And it’s happening in every corner of the globe.",
            "Kevin: I love that we’re celebrating a party—people dancing and performing, there’s something really positive about that."

That means there’s an urgent need to create opportunities for the millions of people on the continent who are creative, smart and driven to succeed. The internet, and technology as a whole, offer great opportunities for creating jobs, growing businesses and boosting economies. But people need the right skills, tools and products to navigate the digital world and to make it work for them, their businesses and their communities.",
            "Today, at our Google for Nigeria event in Lagos, we announced progress we’ve made in our products and features for users in Nigeria, including YouTube, Search and Maps. We also announced initiatives focused on digital skills training, education and economic opportunity, and support for African startups and developers.Digital Skills for AfricaLast year we set out to help bridge the digital skills gap in Africa when we pledged to train one million young people in the region—and we’ve exceeded this target. Through either in-person or online trainings, we help people learn to build a web presence, use Search to find jobs, get tips to enhance their CV, use social media, and so on. Now we’re expanding this program, and committing to prepare another 10 million people for jobs of the future in the next five years. We’ll also be providing mobile developer training to 100,000 Africans to develop world-class apps, with an initial focus on Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.Google.org grants Our charitable arm, Google.org, is committing $20 million over the next five years to nonprofits that are working to improve lives across Africa. We’re giving $2.5 million in initial grants to the nonprofit arms of African startups Gidi Mobile and Siyavula to provide free access to learning for 400,000 low-income students in South Africa and Nigeria. The grantees will also develop new digital learning materials that will be free for anyone to use.We also want to invite nonprofits from across the continent to share their ideas for how they could impact their community and beyond. So we’re launching a Google.org Impact Challenge in Africa in 2018 to award $5 million in grants. Any eligible nonprofit in Africa can apply, and anyone will be able to help select the best ideas by voting online.Launchpad Accelerator AfricaWe want to do more to support African entrepreneurs in building successful technology companies and products. Based on our global Launchpad Accelerator program, this initiative will provide more than $3 million in equity-free funding, mentorship, working space and access to expert advisers to more than 60 African startups over three years. Intensive three-month programs, held twice per year, will run out of a new Google Launchpad Space in Lagos—the program’s first location outside of the United States.Making our products work better in AfricaFor people to take advantage of digital opportunities, acquiring the right skills and tools is only part of the equation. Online products and services—including ours—also need to work better in Africa. Today, we’re sharing news about how we’re making YouTube, Search and Maps more useful and relevant for Nigerian users.YouTube GoDesigned from the ground up, YouTube Go lets you discover, save and share videos you love in a way that’s transparent about the size of downloads. Designed to be “offline” first, the app improves the experience of watching videos on a slower network and gives control over the amount of data used streaming or saving videos. It’s a full YouTube experience, with fresh and relevant video recommendations tailored to your preferences and the ability to share videos quickly and easily with friends nearby.  In June, Nigeria became the second country where we started actively testing YouTube Go. Later this year, we’ll be expanding this to a beta launch of the app, available to all Nigerian users.Lagos now on Street View in Google Maps In the last few months, we’ve improved our address search experience in Lagos, by adding thousands of new addresses and streets, outlines of more than a million buildings in commercial and residential areas, and more than 100,000 additional Nigerian small businesses on Google Maps. Today we’re launching Lagos on Street View, with 10,000 kilometers of imagery, including the most important historic roads in the city. You can virtually drive along the Carter Bridge to the National Stadium or across the Eko Bridge, down to the Marina—all on your smartphone.Faster web resultsWhen you’re on a 2G-like connection or using a low storage device, pages can take a long time to load. We previously launched a feature that streamlines search results so they load with less data and at high speed.  Today we’re extending that feature to streamline websites you reach from search results, so that they load with 90 percent less data and five times faster, even on low storage devices.  More local information in SearchWe’ve also made several updates to Search to bring more useful, relevant answers and information to people in Nigeria: Knowledge Panels: We’re connecting people with easy access to the answers to things they care about, displaying knowledge cards for everything from local football teams to Nigerian musicians and actors. Health Cards: Later this year we’ll launch more than 800 knowledge cards detailing common symptoms and treatments for the most prevalent health conditions in Nigeria. We’ve partnered with the University of Ibadan to ensure that answers have been reviewed by Nigerian doctors for local relevance and accuracy. Nigeria is one of the first countries where we’re providing locally tailored health answers on Search.  Posts on Google: Posts makes it possible for musicians, entertainers and other public figures to share updates, images and videos directly on Google, for people to see while they explore on the web. Nigeria is the third country where we’ve made this feature available and some of the country’s popular musicians are already using it.The things we’re announcing today are what drive us—building platforms and products that are relevant and useful for billions, not just the few, and helping people to succeed in the digital economy. That’s why we hope to equip more people, in Africa and elsewhere, with digital skills and tools. We’re excited to be part of Africa’s evolving digital story."

SOS alerts is a new set of features in Google Search and Maps to help you quickly understand what’s going on and decide what to do during a crisis.",
            "How SOS Alerts WorkDuring a crisis, you may see an SOS Alert at the top of search results when searching for the incident or location. You’ll see maps, top stories and—when available—authoritative local information such as emergency phone numbers, websites, and translations of useful phrases. Depending on how close you are to the affected area, you may also get a notification on your mobile device that directs you to this information.",
            "If you’re outside of the affected area, you may still want information about the crisis. Searches for relevant terms (like the name of the event or the location) will also show an SOS Alert that provides a timely overview of the situation, in addition to features such as donation opportunities.",
            "Google Maps on mobile can also show SOS Alerts. In Maps, you’ll see a specific icon on the map and a tappable card with more information about the crisis, such as helpful phone numbers and websites. The map will also include real-time updates, like road closures and traffic and transit updates.",
            "As we’ve developed our crisis response products, we’ve worked closely with organizations and government agencies that are on the front lines of relief efforts, including the Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration and many others. \"Radio and television were once the only channels to quickly provide information in an emergency, but the internet and mobile phones have become increasingly important,” said Robert Glenn, Director at FEMA.",
            "In addition to SOS Alerts and other crisis response features—including Google Person Finder, Google Crisis Map and Google Public Alerts—our philanthropic arm Google.org provides grants and volunteers for communities impacted by crises. We hope you never need to use crisis response features, but if you do, they’re designed to help keep you, and those you love, safe and informed."

            "With the spread of misinformation online, it’s become increasingly important for news publishers to have a way of communicating to users what information is verified. In 2016, we launched the Fact Check label in Google News and Search to make it easier for people to find articles that fact check public information, ranging from claims to public statements to statistics. Today we’re making it even easier for publishers to help Google find and distribute accurate, fact-checked content across Google News and Search.There are two ways publishers can signal their fact check content to Google. The first is by adding the Share the Facts widget, which is a plug-and-play way for publishers to indicate their fact checks. Today, we're expanding the Share the Facts widget to six new languages: German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Bahasa Indonesian, Hindi and Japanese (it’s already available in English, French and Italian). Share the Facts was created by Jigsaw and the Duke University Reporters’ Lab led by Bill Adair. Currently, organizations such as The Washington Post, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, La Stampa, Gossip Cop, AGI, The Ferret and Climate Feedback are using the Share the Facts widget.In addition to new Share the Facts widget languages, soon you’ll see fact-checked content from these new partners:Aos Fatos, a Brazilian fact-checking organization launched in 2015Wiener Zeitung, an Austrian news organization founded in the 1700sEl Confidencial, a Spanish news organization founded in 2001We hope to expand the widget soon to publishers in Indonesia, Japan and India.The second way that publishers can get involved with Fact Check is by adding Schema.org ClaimReview code directly to article pages. Applying the code to fact check content means Google News and Search may apply the “fact check”  label to your content.Expanding the use of the Fact Check tag to more news organizations around the world is important to raising the visibility of quality journalism on Google. If you’d like to learn more about how to participate in the Fact Check tag, head over to our help center. You can get information on the Share the Facts widget on their website, or email the team at team@sharethefacts.org."

After undergrad, I moved to Champaign, IL to get a master’s degree in engineering, leaving behind the hustle and bustle of India for a small, quiet university town in the Midwest. My newfound independence abroad gave me the space to confront and accept my difference—and come out as gay.During my first summer in the U.S., I visited Boystown in Chicago, one of the most famous gay neighborhoods in the country. It was a bright summer day and the streets were packed with smiling, laughing people from across the LGBTQ community. It was only a matter of seconds before my friends and I got caught up in the excitement and camaraderie of the place. For the first time, I felt I could be myself.When I joined Google, I was excited to find a community of LGBTQ Googlers and allies who celebrate Pride across the world, and not just by marching in parades (although we do lots of that, too). As a company, we want to make sure our products help LGBTQ people feel they can be themselves, whether they’re in Chandigarh or Chicago.",

Most people searching for the lone star tick (named for a star-shaped mark on its back) aren’t actually in the Lone Star state—the top states searching were Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Arkansas and Maryland.Ken gets a makeoverThis week, Mattel unveiled a new cast of Ken dolls, the biggest revamp since 1961. These new Kens come in different shapes and sizes, including “broad” and “slim” body types, leading searchers to look for “dad bod Ken doll” and “diverse ken dolls.” But in the end it wasn’t Ken’s new bod that had people searching—it was his hairstyle. One new Ken is sporting a highly-contested accessory from the past few years: the man bun. The internet couldn’t resist satirizing man bun Ken’s personality, fitness habits and political leanings, and search interest in \"man bun ken\" spiked 300 percent higher than “dad bod Ken.”"

            "Whether you’re a student looking for a part-time job, an electrician seeking work closer to home, or a teacher moving to another state to be close to family, finding a job can be difficult. With job postings scattered across the web, newspapers and help wanted signs, it’s not always easy to find ones that are a good fit based on your unique needs and skills. As a result, many job seekers feel like they can’t find the job they’re looking for or apply to roles that aren’t the right fit. At the same time, 46 percent of U.S. employers face talent shortages and have issues filling open positions with the right candidate.",
            "We have a long history of using our technology to connect people with crucial information. At I/O, we announced Google for Jobs, a company-wide initiative focused on helping both job seekers and employers, through deep collaboration with the job matching industry. This effort includes the Cloud Jobs API, announced last year, which provides access to Google’s machine learning capabilities to power smarter job search and recommendations within career sites, jobs boards, and other job matching sites and apps. Today, we’re taking the next step in the Google for Jobs initiative by putting the convenience and power of Search into the hands of job seekers. With this new experience, we aim to connect Americans to job opportunities across the U.S., so no matter who you are or what kind of job you’re looking for, you can find job postings that match your needs.",
            "Starting today in English on desktop and mobile, when you search for “jobs near me,” “teaching jobs,” or similar job-seeking queries, you’ll see in-depth results that allow you to explore jobs from across the web. For many people, a job needs to satisfy some key criteria, like commute time, job specialties they've honed or the hours they have available to work. For many jobs, you’ll also see reviews and ratings of the employer from trusted sites, right alongside the job description, and if you’re signed in, for some jobs you’ll even see how long it would take to commute to the job from home. We’ll continue to add additional filters and information in the future. Looking for jobs is a personal and complex journey, and one that we’re trying to support in this new search experience.",
            "Searching for a job can take time. And keeping up with new jobs that are posted throughout the day can be impossible. Now, if you step away from your job search, you can pick up right where you left off and stay in the loop on opportunities that interest you. Just turn on alerts for your search to receive an email notification whenever new jobs arrive, keeping you up-to-date and on top of your job hunt.",
            "We’re working with a number of organizations from across the industry to bring you the most comprehensive listing of jobs—including LinkedIn, Monster, WayUp, DirectEmployers, CareerBuilder, Glassdoor and Facebook. This means you’ll see job postings from these sites and many others from across the web as soon as they’re posted. To ensure even more jobs are listed over time, we’re publishing open documentation for all jobs providers, from third-party platforms or direct employers, big or small, detailing how to make their job openings discoverable in this new feature.",
            "People from all walks of life, experiences and backgrounds have undergone a job hunt at some point in their lives. Whether you’re a young adult looking for your first job, a veteran hoping to leverage your leadership experience in civilian life, or a parent looking for a job with better pay to support a growing family, we hope this new experience on Google will help make the job search simpler and more effective."

            "Here's a look a few of the most-searched topics from the week of June 12:",
            "Rep. Steve ScaliseEarlier this week, a gunman opened fire on a Congressional baseball practice, wounding Rep. Steve Scalise and several others. The event prompted people to search about the details—Scalise’s age, his political party and identity of the gunman. “How is Steve Scalise doing?” was a top-searched question, search interest in “support Scalise” spiked 1000x, and interest in “Democrats pray” spiked more than 600% following the shooting.This is why you should floss Daredevil Erendira Wallenda broke her husband Nik’s record for the “iron-jaw hang,” 300 feet above Niagara Falls (yes, she was hanging by her teeth!) People searched for the livestream to watch her complete the historic stunt, as well as “What time will Erendira Wallenda walk across Niagara Falls?” and “How old is Erendira Wallenda?” Love is love Let the parades begin! June is LGBT Pride Month, and celebratory parades are taking place across the country. Washington, D.C., Maryland, Indiana, Massachusetts and Virginia are the top regions searching for Pride, with queries about where and when pride parades are occurring, as well as “what to wear to Pride.” Turns out many parade-goers are thinking about their outfits—search interest for “Love wins shirts” grew 250% this week.  It Ain't Me BabeCramming for your high school English test and delivering a Nobel Prize lecture are the same thing, right? In his Nobel Prize lecture, Bob Dylan spoke of novels (including “Moby Dick”) that have inspired him—and he took a few lines from SparkNotes for the speech. Though this may not be the the first time Dylan has borrowed inspiration for his art, people searched for “Bob Dylan plagiarize Sparknotes,” “Bob Dylan Nobel Prize speech,” and “Bob Dylan Sparknotes Moby Dick.”One small sandwich for manKFC’s latest ad campaign, starring Rob Lowe, promised to launch a fried chicken sandwich into space. Now, it’s going to happen. An Arizona company plans to send the sandwich beyond Earth in a balloon, which left people wondering, “How is KFC going to space?” and “When is KFC sending a chicken sandwich to space?” The extraterrestrial news has led to search interest in “KFC sandwich” rising 300% above “McDonald’s sandwich.”"

            "Cavs vs. Warriors. Cookies vs. oranges. And Madrid vs. manspreaders. Here’s a look at some of the top trending searches from the week of June 2. Nothin’ but net… on Google this week, as people search for details about the NBA Finals. This year marks a third consecutive matchup between the Cavaliers and the Warriors—a first for any two teams in the NBA. Searchers wanted to know who won games 2 and 3, as well as what channel and time the next game was on. Though the Warriors have won every game in the series so far, LeBron James has consistently been at the top of the search pack this week, followed alternately by Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. Finally, if you need a little Basketball 101, you’re not alone: Searchers also asked, “How many games to win the NBA finals?” Four out of seven—and Game 4 tips off tonight.Comey DayThe Warriors may be up 3-0, but when it came to must-see TV they had some competition from an unexpected corner this week. Former FBI Director James Comey testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday about the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, and people were dialed-in. During his testimony, search interest in “Comey live” spiked 200 percent higher than “NBA finals live” at any other point this month in the U.S. Many wanted to know why Comey was fired, as well as “Who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee?” and “Who is questioning Comey right now?” While Comey was answering questions under oath, others were keeping an eye on the President’s reaction, asking “Is Trump live tweeting now?” But the top question about Comey yesterday wasn’t political. It was “How tall is James Comey?” Answer: Taller than Steph Curry, as tall as LeBron James.  An a-peeling parody“Orange is the New Black” debuts its fifth season today, but this week was all about Piper Snackman. Inspired by the Netflix series, Sesame Street released a creative skit to teach kids about the benefits of healthy eating. In addition to Piper, “Orange is the New Snack” features adorable muppet versions of Red, Morello and the rest of the OITNB crew—including, inevitably, “Googley eyes.” Most searchers were simply looking for the video to watch the parody (with variations on “Sesame Street is the new snack” and “Sesame Street does Orange is the New Black”), but Sesame Street should be hopeful that some folks took the message to heart. Search interest in “orange snacks” spiked more than 900 percent this week.",
            "Stop the spreadThis week, Madrid became the most recent city to take a stand on “manspreading” on public transportation. The city’s transit agency will be posting signs on all their buses to remind passengers that taking up more than one seat via their posture is considered bad public transportation behavior. In the U.S., where the NYC subway has had similar signs for three years, people turned to Google to ask “Why is manspreading an issue?” and “is manspreading sexist?” as well as as how to fight it (apart from better signage, we assume). They also wondered, “What do you call manspreading in Spanish?” The answer, as far as we can tell: “el manspreading.” You know what they say—body language is universal.Thank you for being a friendPeople turned to to social media to celebrate their BFFs yesterday for National Best Friends Day. Many searchers were looking for memes and GIFs to share, while more sentimental types searched for “happy national best friend day quotes.” Skeptical about made-up holidays? Consider that other national days people were searching for this week include “VCR Day,” “Attitude Day” and “Chocolate Ice Cream Day.” Whatever you celebrated this week, search has your back—that’s what friends are for."

            "If we had to sum up this week’s search trends with an emoji, we might go with: 🤔 From unconventional college essays to young “spellebrities” to neologisms (you know what that means), here’s a look at some of the top trending searches from the week of May 29. Forget Paris?People turned to Google to learn more about the Paris Agreement, leading up to and in the wake of President Trump’s decision on the U.S.’s role in the international climate deal. In the hour following yesterday’s announcement that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement, searchers wanted to know what countries are—and aren’t—part of it. They also asked “What is the Paris Climate Agreement?” and “Is climate change real?”",
            "Ready? Set. S-p-e-l-l.The Scripps National Spelling Bee kicked off this week, with more than 200 young spellers gathering to compete for the grand prize. People turned to Google to find out what channel the Bee was on (answer: ESPN) and what time it aired. They also asked “Is Edith Fuller still in the Spelling Bee?”, referring to the youngest-ever finalist at the age of six (she was disqualified after preliminary rounds). For those of us who haven’t the faintest idea how to spell words like durchkomponiert, gifblaar or marocain, there’s always Search. This week we released data showing the top searched “how to spell” word by state. Some of the most common look-ups? “Beautiful,” “tomorrow” and “pneumonia.”",
            "The last wordCan you use it in a sentence, please? Late Tuesday night President Trump posted a tweet ending with the word (?) “covfefe.” As the internet spent hours pondering—and joking about—whether the word had a secret meaning or was simply an autocorrect snafu, search interest for “covfefe” exploded to 3,000 percent higher than that for VP Mike Pence. Alongside the basics, like “Is covfefe a word?” and “How to pronounce covfefe?”, were some real head-scratchers: “What does covfefe mean in Russian?” and “How to make covfefe?” We’d tell you, but... the first rule of covfefe is: You do not talk about covfefe.What’s in a name?After someone tweeted a screenshot of her Google search results with the actor and musician Jamie Foxx’s real name—Eric Marlon Bishop—people turned to Google to find out more. In addition to questions about net worth and “Where did Jamie Foxx’s name come from?”, people wanted to know “How did Jamie Foxx get famous?” If that seems like an odd question given Foxx’s long career, consider this: Search interest in Jamie Foxx’s name this week spiked 900 percent over that of his movies and 5,000 percent over interest in his music. So perhaps it was time for a reintroduction.Pizza essay delivers They say to write what you know. High school senior Carolina Williams was accepted to Yale after penning a passionate essay about an unconventional topic—Papa John's pizza. Searches about the essay, which waxed poetic about the sound of the doorbell, warm cardboard boxes and—natch—cheese, were piping hot. Although Williams is from Tennessee, it was only the #4 state searching for the story, behind Kentucky, Indiana and Georgia. The garlic dipping sauce on this golden crust of a story? Williams isn’t even going to Yale! Guess New Haven pizza just can’t compete with her first love."

People turned to Google to make sense of the event, searching to find out what happened, where the bomb went off, and who was responsible.

The organization expects five to nine hurricanes, which led people to search “Is NOAA ever right about the number of hurricanes?” and “How does NOAA predict hurricanes?” Here’s one thing we do know: The next hurricane will be named Bret.Noses are redOn Thursday in the U.S., we celebrated the return of “Love Actually” Red Nose Day, which raises money and awareness to end child poverty. To honor the cause, the cast of “Love Actually” got back together for a 12-minute sequel, and stars like Ben Affleck, Ed Sheeran, Ellen DeGeneres and Emma Watson donned their red noses. Despite the backing from A-list celebs, people still turned to search for more info, like “Where can I get a Red Nose?” and “Where did Red Nose Day originate?” Fun fact: Though Rudolph used to dominate the red nose game, the biggest spike in searches for “red nose” now occur in May for Red Nose Day. Pandora-monium On Saturday, Pandora World of Avatar will open at Disney’s Animal Kingdom in Orlando (what would Walt think if we called it Pandor-lando?). You don’t have to rely on your CGI-inspired imagination anymore, this park is REAL (and it’s not built from unobtainium). Search questions ranged from the logistical: “What day does Avatar land open?” to the more curious: “How much did it cost to build Pandora World?” to the niche: “What font is used for Disney’s Avatar land?” It was 50 years ago todayFixing A Hole in our hearts since 1967, this weekend marks the 50th anniversary of the release of “Sgt.

And finally, many were curious to know what all this means for Trump’s presidency, even asking “If Trump is impeached, who will become President?”FashionistosWe live in a time of innovation, of creativity, of discovery, of … male rompers. Got questions? So do many people who have been searching “What is a male romper?” and “Why are people talking about rompers?” A romper is a one-piece combination of a shirt and shorts, traditionally worn by women. Now, the rompHIM is taking men’s fashion by storm—search interest in romper surpassed that of dress, pants, shorts AND shirt. Now the only question left is “Where can I buy a male romper?”",

            "It’s a sweaty High Five this week, as things heat up at the FBI, in Montana and for an internet challenge. Here’s a look at a few of the of top trending Google searches from the week of May 8.",
            "Ya firedThis week, many in the U.S. were focused on the firing of former FBI director James Comey, but the buzz also led to searches about Watergate (search interest spiked more than 300%). The number of searches for Comey surpassed searches for President Trump, with queries related to Comey’s whereabouts, why he was fired, “Who will replace Comey?” and “How long was Comey FBI director?” Is it hot in here or is it just me? Montana’s Glacier National Park is really starting to heat up (and not in a good way). According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the glaciers are shrinking by an average of 39%. Scientists say the glaciers will likely be gone in our lifetime, so interest about Glacier National Park is climbing. People searched to find out what’s unique about the park, how it formed and “What animals live in Glacier National Park?” (For our animal lovers: Bighorn sheep, boreal toads, western painted turtles and rainbow trout to name a few). Question from us: will the animals be okay post-melt??Bow Wow Challenge takes offThis week, rapper Bow Wow was caught red-handed (red-pawed?) when an airline passenger—now internet hero—called him out for flying in Economy instead of the private jet he posted to Instagram. The internet barked back with the “Bow Wow Challenge,” in which people post a misleading glamorous image next to the actual less-glamorous photo. To keep up with the trend, people are searching, “How did the Bow Wow challenge start?” and “What did Bow Wow lie about?” Thanks to this unintended publicity, search interest in “Bow Wow challenge” rose 1000% above searches for his music. Woof.It ain’t over until the Idol singsWe said goodbye to American Idol in its final season last year, but now it’s getting an encore. Announced this week, the show is coming back for a 16th season on ABC. Search volume went up a few pitches with questions like, “Who will be the judges on American Idol?” and Iis Ryan Seacrest coming back to American Idol?” (As noted in our trends from last week, Seacrest has a new gig). After the announcement, search interest for Kelly Clarkson, original darling of American Idol, spiked 193%.",

People are hoping Google can help with “what to get Mom for Mother’s Day,” “what to do for Mother’s Day,” and even “what to write in a Mother’s Day card.” Here’s an idea, inspired by the trends from this week:Being my mom is the one job you’ll never get fired from, and I sing your praises every day. Global warming aside, my love for you will never melt and to you I’ll always bow. Wow, I’m lucky to have you. Happy Mother’s Day!"

        "Publish Date": "Apr 25, 2017",
        "article_paragraphs": [
            "Search can always be improved. We knew it when I started working on Search in 1999, and it’s still true today. Back then, the Internet was expanding at an incredible rate. We had to make sense of this explosion of information, organize it, and present it in a way so that people could find what they were looking for, right on the Google results page. The work then was around PageRank, the core algorithm used to measure the importance of webpages so they could be ranked in results. In addition to trying to organize information, our algorithms have always had to grapple with individuals or systems seeking to “game” our systems in order to appear higher in search results—using low-quality “content farms,” hidden text and other deceptive practices. We've tackled these problems, and others over the years, by making regular updates to our algorithms and introducing other features that prevent people from gaming the system.",
            "Today, in a world where tens of thousands of pages are coming online every minute of every day, there are new ways that people try to game the system. The most high profile of these issues is the phenomenon of “fake news,” where content on the web has contributed to the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information. While this problem is different from issues in the past, our goal remains the same—to provide people with access to relevant information from the most reliable sources available. And while we may not always get it right, we’re making good progress in tackling the problem. But in order to have long-term and impactful changes, more structural changes in Search are needed.",
            "With that longer-term effort in mind, today we’re taking the next step toward continuing to surface more high-quality content from the web. This includes improvements in Search ranking, easier ways for people to provide direct feedback, and greater transparency around how Search works.",
            "Search rankingOur algorithms help identify reliable sources from the hundreds of billions of pages in our index. However, it’s become very apparent that a small set of queries in our daily traffic (around 0.25 percent), have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content, which is not what people are looking for. To help prevent the spread of such content for this subset of queries, we’ve improved our evaluation methods and made algorithmic updates to surface more authoritative content.New Search Quality Rater guidelines: Developing changes to Search involves a process of experimentation. As part of that process, we have evaluators—real people who assess the quality of Google’s search results—give us feedback on our experiments. These ratings don’t determine individual page rankings, but are used to help us gather data on the quality of our results and identify areas where we need to improve. Last month, we updated our Search Quality Rater Guidelines to provide more detailed examples of low-quality webpages for raters to appropriately flag, which can include misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and unsupported conspiracy theories. These guidelines will begin to help our algorithms in demoting such low-quality content and help us to make additional improvements over time.Ranking changes: We combine hundreds of signals to determine which results we show for a given query—from the freshness of the content, to the number of times your search queries appear on the page. We’ve adjusted our signals to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content, so that issues similar to the Holocaust denial results that we saw back in December are less likely to appear.",
            "Direct feedback toolsWhen you visit Google, we aim to speed up your experience with features like Autocomplete, which helps predict the searches you might be typing to quickly get to the info you need, and Featured Snippets, which shows a highlight of the information relevant to what you’re looking for at the top of your search results. The content that appears in these features is generated algorithmically and is a reflection of what people are searching for and what’s available on the web. This can sometimes lead to results that are unexpected, inaccurate or offensive. Starting today, we’re making it much easier for people to directly flag content that appears in both Autocomplete predictions and Featured Snippets. These new feedback mechanisms include clearly labeled categories so you can inform us directly if you find sensitive or unhelpful content. We plan to use this feedback to help improve our algorithms.",
            "Greater transparency about our productsOver the last few months, we’ve been asked tough questions about why shocking or offensive predictions were appearing in Autocomplete. Based on this, we evaluated where we can improve our content policies and updated them appropriately. Now we’re publishing this policy to the Help Center so anyone can learn more about Autocomplete and our approach to removals.",
            "For those looking to delve a little deeper, we recently updated our How Search Works site to provide more information to users and website owners about the technology behind Search. The site includes a description of how Google ranking systems sort through hundreds of billions of pages to return your results, as well as an overview of our user testing process.",
            "There are trillions of searches on Google every year. In fact, 15 percent of searches we see every day are new—which means there’s always more work for us to do to present people with the best answers to their queries from a wide variety of legitimate sources. While our search results will never be perfect, we’re as committed as always to preserving your trust and to ensuring our products continue to be useful for everyone."

Searchers were curious about which advertising agency was behind the ad, and asked “why did Pepsi apologize?” and “why did Pepsi pull the ad?”",

            "Google was built to help people find useful information by surfacing the great content that publishers and sites create. This access to high quality information is what drives people to use the web and for contributors to continue to engage and invest in it.",
            "However, with thousands of new articles published online every minute of every day, the amount of content confronting people online can be overwhelming.  And unfortunately, not all of it is factual or true, making it hard for people to distinguish fact from fiction. That’s why last October, along with our partners at Jigsaw, we announced that in a few countries we would start enabling publishers to show a “Fact Check” tag in Google News for news stories. This label identifies articles that include information fact checked by news publishers and fact-checking organizations.",
            "After assessing feedback from both users and publishers, we’re making the Fact Check label in Google News available everywhere, and expanding it into Search globally in all languages. For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page. The snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim.",
            "This information won’t be available for every search result, and there may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions. These fact checks are not Google’s and are presented so people can make more informed judgements. Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree. As we make fact checks more visible in Search results, we believe people will have an easier time reviewing and assessing these fact checks, and making their own informed opinions.",
            "For publishers to be included in this feature, they must be using the Schema.org ClaimReview markup on the specific pages where they fact check public statements (documentation here), or they can use the Share the Facts widget developed by the Duke University Reporters Lab and Jigsaw. Only publishers that are algorithmically determined to be an authoritative source of information will qualify for inclusion. Finally, the content must adhere to the general policies that apply to all structured data markup, the Google News Publisher criteria for fact checks, and the standards for accountability and transparency, readability or proper site representation as articulated in our Google News General Guidelines. If a publisher or fact check claim does not meet these standards or honor these policies, we may, at our discretion, ignore that site's markup.",

Here’s a look at five of the top trending Google searches from the week of March 27.The Raiders’ big betIt’s official—the Raiders are moving to Las Vegas. This week, the Oakland franchise announced that they’ll be taking their talents to Sin City. Though the move won’t take place until 2020, people are already searching for season tickets. Still, questions remain—like what are the odds the team will get to keep their name?We hardly knew EURaider fans aren’t the only nation facing change. British Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 this week, officially kicking off the process for the U.K. to exit the European Union in 2019. People turned to search to ask “What does Brexit mean for Britain?” and “How does Brexit affect the EU?” They’re also curious about how it will affect financial markets: “Brexit stocks” is the top trending related search to “stocks” worldwide in the past week.A twist ending?The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences confirmed that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers will continue to work for the Oscars next year, putting an end to queries like \"Did the Oscars fire Pwc?\" and \"Will the Oscars retain PwC?\" But after this year’s Best Picture envelope mix-up, which was blamed on a employee distracted by his phone, PwC's accountants will have to stash their devices next time.

The zoo launched a live stream for people to tune in to the birth way back in February. But yesterday, they announced that the “calf countdown” had begun. The timing—and the mama-to-be’s name—has some people skeptical: Top queries include “Is April the Giraffe an April Fool’s joke?” and “Is April the Giraffe a hoax?”",

With a theme as limitless as “What I see for the future…”, we knew the artwork would be out of this world—and with all the Doodles set in space, we were not disappointed! This year’s talented artists dreamed of almost everything— from a future with modernized homes and no endangered animals, to one filled with compassion, community and inventions we hadn’t even imagined yet.. Today, millions of people can enjoy the winning masterpiece, which now hangs on the Google homepage.",

In this splendid, visionary piece, she drew a group of people from different backgrounds coming together to create one harmonious community. Here’s how she explains her art: “My future is a world where we can all learn to love each other despite our religion, gender, race, ethnicity, or sexuality. I dream of a future where everyone is safe and accepted wherever they go, whoever they are.”",

In addition to her art being showcased on the Google homepage, Sarah will receive $30,000 toward a college scholarship, and the opportunity to meet with the Doodle team at the Googleplex in Mountain View. As an added bonus: Bunnell High School (Sarah’s home school) will receive $50,000 to spend ontechnology to help foster the next generation of STEM professionals (and who knows, maybe future Googlers, too!).",

This group focused on diverse communities, ancient animals, new energy sources, and solutions to help minimize electronic waste.

Brazilians are also heavy users of Google products, from Search and Android to YouTube and Maps to Photos and Waze. And Brazil is an innovation hub for Google. Our engineering team in Belo Horizonte has made remarkable contributions to our products globally, such as improving health-related searches.But we know there is still a lot of work to do in Brazil and elsewhere to make technology work better for more people. So today at our Google for Brazil event in São Paulo, we made several announcements about how we're working to make the internet more inclusive and to make our products work better for people in Brazil—and around the world.",
            "Google Duo audio callingLast year we created Google Duo to bring simple, high-quality video calling to users on Android and iOS. Now we’re adding audio-only calling in Duo. So in those moments when video calling isn't an option—like when you’re about to hop on a crowded bus or have a poor network connection—you can stay connected with family and friends through audio calling. Duo audio calls work well on all connection speeds and won't eat up your data. This feature will be available starting today first in Brazil, and we'll be rolling it out to users around the world in the coming days.",

Starting today, Android users everywhere will be able to share documents and other files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3) with friends on Allo. And for users in Brazil, we're also rolling out Smart Smiley in Portuguese, which uses machine learning to help you find the right emoji faster. Tap the Smart Smiley icon on the compose bar, and the app will suggest relevant emojis and stickers to help you finish your thought.",
            "Google Photos: Faster backup and sharing, no matter the connectionWe built Google Photos to help people store, organize and share photos and videos in a hassle-free way. But it can sometimes be difficult to back up and share photos and videos, especially when you're on the go and don't have an internet connection. So today we're rolling out two new features to make backup and sharing easier on low connectivity. Now on Android your photos will back up automatically in a lightweight preview quality if you aren't able to back up in high quality, and still look great on a smartphone. And when a good Wi-Fi connection becomes available, your backed up photos will be replaced with high-quality versions. We’re also making it easier to share many photos at once even on low connectivity. Never mind if you're at the beach or hiking in the mountains, with Google Photos on Android and iOS you can now share pictures quickly even with a spotty connection by sending first in low resolution so friends and family can view them right away. They'll later update in higher resolution when connectivity permits.It can be hard to find time to organize your pictures, so Google Photos automatically creates animations, movies, collages, and albums. For movies, Google Photos will select the best moments, put them together with professional-style transitions, and set it all to music. With Brazil in mind, we recently rolled out a great example of these kinds of movies—your best photos from Carnival, set to a soundtrack of samba.",
            "Maps location sharingWe're adding a new location sharing feature in Google Maps that lets you tell your friends and family where you are and when you’ll arrive at your destination. You have complete control over whether you share your location, who you share it with, and how long you share it. You can stop sharing at any time. No more \"where are you now?\" messages back and forth. To manage your location sharing settings across Google products go to the \"Your personal info\" section of My Account and select Location Sharing.",
            "Posts on GoogleLast year we started experimenting with allowing people and places to post directly on Google Search. We started out with the U.S. election and have completed dozens of other experiments around the world. Starting today, in the U.S. and Brazil, we’re taking it to the next step and opening up the application process so that organizations and people within specific categories can post directly on Google.Now, when you search for museums, sports teams, sports leagues, movies and, in Brazil for now, musicians, you can find content from that participating organization or person, right on Google. So if you’re searching for the Henry Ford Museum in the U.S. or for Vanessa da Mata in Brazil, you'll see updates directly from the source with relevant information, like new exhibits, timely updates and interesting facts. Beyond these categories in the U.S. and Brazil, we’ll continue to experiment globally and look forward to making Search even more useful and timely.",
            "We made some Brazil-specific announcements at our event in São Paulo today as well, including plans to roll out the Google Assistant in Brazilian Portuguese on Android phones running Marshmallow or Nougat. We also extended a $5 million Google.org grant to the Lemann Foundation for an exciting tech-based education project in Brazil, launched the iconic São Paulo Museum of Art on Google Arts & Culture, and announced plans to roll out Waze Carpool in Brazil later this year.All of today's announcements were inspired by your feedback. We do extensive research in places like Brazil, and we use those insights to make new product features tailored to people's needs in mobile-first countries. The great thing about building products for the most difficult, limited internet conditions is that you end up creating great products for everyone, everywhere."

        "article_paragraphs": [
            "Every day, people around the globe rely on the power of Google Search to access the world’s information. In fact, we see more than one trillion searches each year. As we continue to invest in new cloud-based technologies like machine learning to power our web search engine, we want to help businesses harness the same technology to search for internal information. Today, we’re announcing Google Cloud Search (formerly known as Springboard), a new product that uses machine intelligence to provide a unified search experience across G Suite.Sorting through internal information has become increasingly complex as more and more companies move their data and workloads to the cloud. As a result, teams are working on hybrid environments and storing immense amounts of data all over and in various formats. From emails and docs to spreadsheets, slides, forms, internal sites, and more. In fact, according to McKinsey, the average knowledge worker spends 20% of the workweek searching for and consolidating information. Simply put, employees are wasting a lot of time in the process of finding information they need to do their job.A smarter search experience, tailored for youCloud Search brings the best of Google Search and machine intelligence to G Suite. It provides both comprehensive search and proactive recommendations to help you throughout your day.For example, when you open the Cloud Search app on your phone or laptop, you’ll see relevant information organized into simple cards (assist cards) that help you stay on top of your work. Assist cards are a new way to help you find the right information at the right time. Using Google’s machine intelligence technology, these  cards can help you prepare for an upcoming meeting or even suggest files that need your attention.Assist cards are designed to be timely and relevant so that you can navigate your workday more efficiently. As we continue to learn how information is most useful to you, we’ll be adding more assist cards to Cloud Search over time.",
            "In addition to searching for information, you can also search for people listed in your company’s directory. You’ll see colleagues’ contact details, plus events and files you have in common. You can even choose to send an email, make a call, or start a Hangout with just a tap.",
            "For businesses, privacy is a top priority. Cloud Search respects G Suite’s file sharing permissions, so people can only search for and find files that they have access to. This means that company resources like vacation policies can be found by everyone in your organization, but your team projects will only surface to people on your team, and your to-do lists will only be available to you.Breaking down information silos at work",
            "Since launching in the Early Adopter Program last summer, companies have been using Cloud Search to break down internal silos and access information more quickly. QAD, an ERP solutions provider for global manufacturing companies, helps businesses manage their finances, supply chain, business intelligence and more. Very little time can be spared sifting through documents to find what’s needed to make strategic business decisions, so QAD uses Cloud Search to help.“At QAD, we operate at a high-level of speed and require technology that provides us agility, flexibility and seamless access to information. Cloud Search provides that. It’s given us the ability to break down silos that exist across different content systems and unlock information with very little effort from IT, “ says Scott Lawrence Lawson, Director of IT Architecture.",
            "Coming to G SuiteCloud Search will begin rolling out globally for customers using the G Suite Business and Enterprise editions. And this is just the beginning. In the future, we’ll be adding more capabilities to Cloud Search including integration with third-party applications. That way, you and your team can find, access and make the most of your information in G Suite and beyond."

From Powerball numbers to Olympic champions, whether making dessert or becoming a mannequin, this year affected us all in different ways. Through all the highs and lows, people came to Search to learn more and understand.",
            "So to celebrate the end of 2016, here’s a peek at some of the trending U.S. topics that caught our attention as especially unique to this year.Powerball: It may seem like a distant memory now, but back in January a record-breaking jackpot made Powerball a hot topic. Search interest in Powerball spiked more than 166 percent, and it’s the top trending search for all of 2016.Politicians and athletes: In a year with the Olympics and U.S. Election, it’s not surprising that nine of our 10 top trending people of the year fell into one of these two categories — from Donald Trump to Michael Phelps and Hillary Clinton to Simone Biles. The one outlier? Steven Avery, the subject of Netflix’s “Making a Murderer” documentary.Pokémon Go: Pokémon Go took our lists — and the world — by storm this year. The addictive game appeared four times in our list of top 10 “How to…” questions, with “How to play Pokémon Go?” at the top. Clearly searchers were eager to learn how to catch ‘em all!Quinoa and Budweiser: From Big Macs to quinoa, Budweiser to Maui Brewing, Brussels sprouts to Buttercream Frosting, it’s clear from our trending calorie, recipe and beer lists that we’re a country of many tastes. One of the new trending recipes this year? Snow cream, a dessert that’s the perfect winter treat with some fresh snow, sugar, milk and vanilla.Slime and... mannequins: “How to make slime” isn’t a phrase we hear often — until now. Maybe it was the new “Ghostbusters” movie, but while voting and Pokémon dominated much of this year’s “How to…” list, one green, slimy question made its way up to #4. Meanwhile, on the “What is…?” list, the mannequin challenge is standing proud — and very, very still — at #7.These are just a few of the trending terms that made up 2016. From remembering past icons like David Bowie and Prince, to searching for current ones like Beyoncé and Alexander Hamilton (a.k.a. Lin-Manuel Miranda), to looking for information on Brexit, Zika, Orlando and Brussels, Search brought us together in dozens of ways this year. Dive into google.com/2016 to see lists from around the world.Here's to finding what we're searching for in 2017."

Nearly two thirds of smartphone owners use messaging more than five times a day to communicate with others.1 And people aren’t limiting their use of messaging to social communications - 65% of consumers say they’d consider using messaging to connect with a business to get information about a product or service, or to schedule an in-person appointment.2\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’re introducing click-to-message ads to bring the efficiency and effectiveness of messaging to search ads. By setting up a message extension, you’ll give users an easy way to text you to start a conversation and continue it whenever is most convenient for them.\n\nTapping on the texting option launches a user’s SMS app with a pre-written message tailored to the product or service they’re interested in. For example, if you’re a travel advertiser and someone messages you after searching for New York City hotels, they can send or edit your pre-written message text, “I’m interested in a reservation. Please text me back with more information.”",

It's a seamless and streamlined process that helps increase brand trust. The conversion rate on message extensions is 41% higher compared to other ad extensions. Paired with customer support software, they’ve also allowed our agents to respond to requests in a more efficient and cost-effective way. ”- Gabe Thayn, Director of Search Marketing, TravelPASS Group",

Text messaging is a popular medium of communication among young professionals and the opportunity to engage them through SMS is very exciting. We sell industrial equipment and supplies, which can be very technical. Sometimes customers don’t have time to talk over a web chat or phone conversation, but still need more information. Messaging helps simplify these exchanges and the customer response has been very positive since they can post a question and follow up in their own time.\"- Ashar Mairaj, VP of Marketing, Global Industrial",

            "As students and families share their hopes for the future, we want to make it easier for college to be a central part of that conversation. More historically underserved students are enrolling in college for the first time; more students are graduating from college than ever; and new student loan defaults, delinquencies, and forbearances are on the decline. Today, a college degree is the surest pathway to the middle class, with college graduates earning $1 million more over their lifetimes.Through reforms to make colleges more affordable and accessible, we’re helping more students earn their college degree. We’ve simplified the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by making it available earlier and by letting families use the previous year’s tax information, rather than making them estimate taxes for the current year. We’ve made it easier by allowing families to import tax information directly from the IRS. We’ve also doubled federal financial aid investments, created better, more affordable debt repayment options and promoted innovation and competition to bring down college costs and improve the quality of education. All of those changes have helped lower the barriers to applying to college. These accomplishments are quantifiable. Then, there are those that aren’t — like how we are turning conversations from “Can I even afford college?” to “Where should I go?” and “What should I study?” or “How can I serve the community with my college education?” Those questions are now easier to answer than ever because of tools like the College Scorecard — and with the help of Google’s technology, this data will now be easily accessible to more people nationwide. Designed hand-in-hand with students, parents, educators, researchers, policymakers and counselors, the College Scorecard has the most comprehensive data ever published about college costs, graduation rates, employment outcomes and student debt for every college. The dataset includes nearly 2,000 elements for more than 7,000 institutions, dating back 18 years. With the College Scorecard, students and families can have better information to answer their college questions when looking into which schools to apply to. Starting next year, the FAFSA will direct students to the College Scorecard so that they can expand their college search and make the most informed college decision. And anyone — teachers, counselors, policymakers, researchers and school leaders — can use the data to support students’ success.  We're thrilled that starting today you can find college cost, graduation and earnings information from the College Scorecard directly in Google Search. Hundreds of millions of students and families pursue their college questions through Google, where trillions of searches are made every year. By featuring this data front and center, Google is helping more students and families get the information they need when they need it",
            "Google is also part of a robust and diverse group of organizations and companies committed to improving college access, affordability and outcomes. Organizations such as the College Board, ACT and Common App are encouraging students to use the College Scorecard and FAFSA to find schools that are good values before they submit their college entrance exam scores and their college applications. Apps such as  College Abacus, and Pell Abacus are building College Scorecard data into college search tools oriented towards low-income students while federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense are building the data into their college search tools to ensure that students have the information they need to apply their service member and veterans’ benefits at high-quality schools. Together, we’re working to let all hard-working students know that they have the resources and supporters there alongside them every step of the way so that they can reach their educational goals."

            "Consumer expectations for immediacy and relevance are higher than ever, and successful brands are those that connect with consumers in those critical moments — the I-want-to-know, I-want-to-go, I-want-to-buy moments. Based on our deep understanding of intent and context, we’ve built products like remarketing lists for search ads (RLSA) and Customer Match to help you be there and be relevant in those moments. Today, at SMX East in New York City, I’ll be sharing new insight into these ad innovations.\n\n\nRLSA gets even better\nRLSA makes it easy to connect with customers who are already familiar with your business by allowing you to adjust your search ads, bids, and keywords based on their past activity on your website. Starting today, we’re introducing improvements to RLSA to give you more flexibility and help drive better performance:\n\nReach your customers across devices. If someone visits your website on their laptop or tablet, you can now reach them with more relevant ads when they search on their phone.\nKeep site visitors in your list for 540 days. This longer membership duration makes it easier for businesses with seasonality or high consideration products to reach their customers.\nAdd your remarketing lists at the campaign level later this year, making it faster and easier to use RLSA. This will work for Customer Match too.\n\nSince RLSA’s initial launch, advertisers like Intel, TransUnion and David Jones have seen tremendous results.\n\n\nCustomer Match delivers results, especially when used with RLSA\nCustomer Match helps you reach your highest-value customers across Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail. We’ve found that advertisers using Customer Match and RLSA in combination are seeing strong performance.\n\nAt SMX East I shared this insight that we learned from many advertisers who are seeing great results. Wine Enthusiast, a retailer for all things wine, combined RLSA with Customer Match and saw a 3x increase in ROI compared to search campaigns that used keyword targeting alone.\n\n\nDemographics for search ads\nDemographics for search ads (DFSA) has started rolling out to all advertisers globally. DFSA lets you adjust bids for ages and genders, and even exclude them, to help you reach specific groups of customers, as well as report on how they impact your campaigns. Learn more.\n\nLet’s say you’re a clothing retailer, and the majority of your customers are millennials — DFSA can help you to reach this audience more effectively. For example, you might increase your bids for users ages 18 to 34 to drive more sales from this valuable group of consumers.\nPairing insights like this with your search strategy can help you be there for your customers with the most relevant ad experience possible. Here are some advertisers who’ve seen success:",
            "\"DFSA was clearly a product we wanted to implement on our top campaigns. Since applying bids based on age, we've seen big gains in efficiency and engagement: searchers that DFSA identifies as over the age of 45 have shown a 65% higher CTR and a 15% lower CPA.\" — Rene Rios, Director of Membership Development at AARP",
            "“With DFSA, we can concentrate our marketing dollars on the audiences most important to us. By employing bid modifiers for women ages 25 to 44, we saw CPA decreases of 25% in our campaigns compared to normal search.” — Ya-Yung Cheng, Sr. Director of Digital Marketing & CRM at Sylvan Learning"

In fact, election-related search interest is up 240% in 2016 compared to a similar point during the 2012 election cycle. And those trends around search interest tell an interesting story, revealing the candidates, moments and issues people are most interested in. To make it easier to explore this data, we created the Google Trends Election Hub.Starting today, the Trends Elections Hub will offer a real-time pulse of the U.S. elections based on Google Trends. On the Hub, you can explore how people are searching for the candidates and political issues across the country. For example, if you explore search interest in the Libertarian party, you’ll see that it’s more searched now than in the 2008 and 2012 elections. The Hub also will help you to find insights about this election at a new, granular level. For instance, while the economy is the most searched issue on average across the swing state of Florida, immigration is more searched in southern counties in the state.At the top of the Hub, you can click to explore the Presidential candidates, Vice Presidential candidates and campaign tickets.",

            "We hope our new friends around the globe love sharing GIFs, emojis and searching as much as we do. To try Gboard, go to the U.S. app store or to your local app store and try any of our six languages, with more coming soon."

This November, Americans all across the country will line up at the polls to cast their ballots for the President of the United States. With states’ varied deadlines and methods, the voter registration process can be tricky.",
            "So starting on Monday, we're introducing a new tool in Search to simplify the voter registration process to make it easier for you to have your voice heard. Now when you search for “register to vote” or similar queries, Google will display a detailed state-by-state guide providing information on how to register, general requirements, and deadlines. No matter which state you’re in or how you plan to cast your ballot, you can find the step-by-step information you need to register correctly and on time—right at the top of your Search page and in the Google app. \n\nAnd for the kickoff of the Republican National Convention next week (and coming in time for the Democratic National Convention the following week), when you search for these events on the Google app, you’ll find a summary of the event, nominees and the lineup of speakers. You’ll also find a livestream video from YouTube, and relevant social media posts, so you can stay up-to-date with both the political parties and the public. \n\nWe hope these new features in Search will help keep you informed this election season and make it easier for you to make it to the ballot box in November."

Just long press the home button and tap the “Translate this screen” card. Voilà, the text on screen will be translated into your phone’s language.  \n\nSo if you’re using Google Maps and come across a location or a restaurant review in a foreign language, just long press the home button and continue reading.

Now people who feel the effects of an earthquake can ask Google directly about the disaster and get timely information to help them stay safe. \nIn the event of an earthquake, searches for “earthquake,” “earthquakes near me” or similar queries will give you an at-a-glance summary about the quake, right at the top of the search page.",

Oftentimes, you really want to know whether you just felt a small earthquake nearby, or a larger earthquake farther away. The map will show areas that shook with various intensities (known as a shakemap), so you’ll be able to quickly assess the reach of the earthquake as well as its epicenter.\n\nYou’ll also find clearly displayed tips on what to do next to stay safe from damaged buildings and during potential earthquake aftershocks. To give you the ability to confirm aftershocks in the hours and days after the event, we’ll also show information about other recent earthquakes to put the tremors into context.\n\nWe hope that by displaying this result directly in Search, people will have fast and easy access to the information they need to stay safe in the face of an earthquake."

            "Picture this: you woke up today with a headache. It’s been getting worse all day, and you aren’t sure if you should be worried or not. So you open the Google app and start searching for your symptoms. After 20 minutes digging through health forums, chances are you're overwhelmed by all the complicated medical terms and breaking out in a sweat—whether that’s related to the headache or the overdose of info is unclear!\n\nYou’re not alone. Roughly 1 percent of searches on Google (think: millions!) are symptom-related. But health content on the web can be difficult to navigate, and tends to lead people from mild symptoms to scary and unlikely conditions, which can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress.\nSo starting in the coming days, when you ask Google about symptoms like “headache on one side,” we’ll show you a list of related conditions (“headache,” “migraine,” “tension headache,” “cluster headache,” “sinusitis,” and “common cold”). For individual symptoms like “headache,” we’ll also give you an overview description along with information on self-treatment options and what might warrant a doctor’s visit. By doing this, our goal is to help you to navigate and explore health conditions related to your symptoms, and quickly get to the point where you can do more in-depth research on the web or talk to a health professional. \n\nWe create the list of symptoms by looking for health conditions mentioned in web results, and then checking them against high-quality medical information we’ve collected from doctors for our Knowledge Graph. We worked with a team of medical doctors to carefully review the individual symptom information, and experts at Harvard Medical School and Mayo Clinic evaluated related conditions for a representative sample of searches to help improve the lists we show.",
            "That said, symptom search (like all medical information on Google) is intended for informational purposes only, and you should always consult a doctor for medical advice. We rely on search results, and we reflect what’s on the web. Because of this, your feedback is especially important to us; we’ll use it to keep improving the results we show. You’ll notice in the weeks following launch that when we show symptom search we’ll automatically ask you if the results are helpful. \nWe’re rolling this update out on mobile over the next few days, in English in the U.S. to start. Over time, we hope to cover more symptoms, and we also want to extend this to other languages and internationally. So the next time you’re worried about your “child with knee pain” (even though it’s probably just growing pains), or have some symptoms you’re too embarrassed to run by your roommate, a Google search will be a helpful place to start."

            "Over the last week we've received questions about our autocomplete feature. I wanted to take the opportunity to clarify a few things. \n\nThe autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person’s name with terms that are offensive or disparaging. We made this change a while ago following feedback that Autocomplete too often predicted offensive, hurtful or inappropriate queries about people.  This filter operates according to the same rules no matter who the person is, as you can see in some examples here.\n\nAutocomplete isn’t an exact science, and the output of the prediction algorithms changes frequently. Predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity and freshness of search terms. Given that search activity varies, the terms that appears in Autocomplete for you may change over time. If you come across an Autocomplete prediction you consider offensive, please let us know. \n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that Autocomplete predictions aren’t search results and don’t limit what you can search for. It’s a shortcut for those who are interested. You can still perform whatever search you want to, and of course, regardless of what you search for, we always strive to deliver the most relevant results from across the web.\n\nWe welcome feedback — and scrutiny — as it helps us provide you the best services. We recognize that your trust is what keeps you using Google, so we take our responsibility seriously.  From the beginning, our approach has been to provide the most relevant answers, and we’ll continue doing just that."
