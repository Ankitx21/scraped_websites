        "body": "Squid 2.0 introduces a new architecture that abstracts away chains to simplify even complex transaction flows with multiple hops. The update includes performance and cost improvements, and expands Squid 2.0\u2019s functionality into new areas such as 1:1 stablecoin transfers, real-world asset (RWA) transactions and advanced routing. This new approach goes far beyond finding the most efficient bridge routes, according to Fig, Squid\u2019s co-founder. \u201cWe are a bridging tool in a certain way, but we think that we can change the way that swaps are also done,\u201d Fig told Blockworks. Read more: Squid enables one-click cross-chain swaps on Cosmos A key innovation in Squid 2.0 is its graph-based architecture, which enables intelligent routing through over 110 liquidity sources across 77 chains. This ensures that swaps are executed using the most efficient paths, reducing costs and increasing execution speed. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  \u201cIn Squid v1, it was a very simple routing algorithm \u2014 we would just always swap via wETH into USDC, and then we bridge and swap out on the other side. But with Squid v2, we\u2019ve upped the infrastructure a lot.\u201d Squid\u2019s new algorithm compares liquidity across multiple dexes and liquidity pools, automatically choosing the most cost-effective route. This focus on speed builds on the previous version\u2019s Squid Boost feature, which allows for sub-20 second swaps across chains, adding real-time quotes delivered in under half a second, the team says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much variation happening in cross-chain that we had to build a system which was able to adapt to all of the change in liquidity, of new technology, instantly and without us having to do anything manually on our side,\u201d Fig explained. Competition is heating up in the cross-chain space. Just this week, Osmosis debuted its latest product. Polaris, a cross-chain token portal, aggregates DEXs and leverages the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal pitched Polaris as a bid to tackle what he calls, \u201cthe Great Chain Divide.\u201d \u201cLiquidity is fragmented and sticky on its native chain, driven by both inertia and incentives (everyone\u2019s trying to build their own internal DeFi ecosystems!),\u201d Aggarwal wrote on X. Squid similarly integrates liquidity from Osmosis, Astroport and other dex, not only in Cosmos but across multiple Ethereum layer-2s, Bitcoin (via the Chainflip cross-chain dex) and soon Solana as well. ZeroDev also demoed a Magic Account, showcasing wallet abstraction with a user-centric design, including social login with passkeys and gasless transactions. Read more: Vitalik rallies support for temporary smart wallets on Ethereum Squid is also advocating for a \u201ctoken-first\u201d approach that lets users interact seamlessly with their digital assets, regardless of which chain they reside on. For example, a user can see an aggregated USDC balance across chains, and have Squid automatically choose the most cost-efficient way to complete a transaction \u2014 say, swapping into a memecoin. The interface will also address the problem of multiple wrapped versions of stablecoins that proliferate as a result of cross-chain bridging, Fig said. This solves a major UX pain point. \u201cWe work with stablecoin providers directly, and then they will use Axelar [Interchain Token Service], or even if they don\u2019t use it, we can swap the stablecoin on the other side,\u201d he said. This level of chain abstraction is a major milestone in creating a fully noncustodial, multichain environment. \u201cWe can start to move to the world where you don\u2019t see the chain ever,\u201d Fig said. \u201cWe can move this \u2018Coinbase experience\u2019 \u2014 which is really what 99% of crypto in the world use \u2014 into a fully self-custodial environment with decentralized liquidity as well.\u201d"

        "body": "Stablecoins are having a moment, that much is clear. As the rest of crypto trades sideways, the market capitalization of stablecoins has steadily increased. It sits now at $170 million, per rwa.xzy, though there has been a slight dip over the past few days. Castle Island Ventures, alongside Artemis, Visa and Brevan Howard Digital made a new survey that looks into the prevalence of stablecoins in certain emerging markets. The survey looked into roughly 2,500 crypto users in Nigeria, India, Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil. \u201cOur survey results contradict the common belief that stablecoins are exclusively used as a tool for the speculative trading of crypto assets. Forty-seven percent of crypto users surveyed list saving in dollars as their stablecoin objective, 43% cited efficient currency conversion and 39% said yield generation. Gaining access to crypto exchanges remains the top use case for those surveyed, but a long tail or ordinary (non-crypto) economic activities is evident as well,\u201d the report said. Read more: Stablecoins are \u2018a better product\u2019 than local currencies in emerging economies, Carrica says \u201cThe findings are clear: non-crypto uses account for a meaningful share of stablecoin usage modes in the countries surveyed.\u201d Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures told Blockworks he\u2019s been curious about tracking the data because he wanted to better understand how folks are using stablecoins. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  From here, Carter will take the findings to Washington DC. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and various US officials, have been pretty vocal about their stablecoin opinions. There is also a push from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis to introduce regulations around stablecoins. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at emerging markets, this is a case of currency substitution where savings would be held in the naira or the Turkish lira or the Indian rupee, and it\u2019s actually being converted into the dollar,\u201d Carter explained. \u201cSo this is a positive buying pressure for the dollar and all the dollar assets that the stablecoin issuers hold (which are Treasurys). So my point is: This is a flow into the dollar. It\u2019s a new source of demand. It\u2019s very meaningful, and obviously it\u2019s supportive of US interests.\u201d But while it may impress US lawmakers, those in, say, Nigeria might not be as thrilled with some of the results. As we\u2019ve previously reported, Nigeria became more hostile toward crypto earlier this year, detaining two Binance executives (American Tigran Gambaryan is still being held in the country), and charging Binance with tax evasion and money laundering. Nigeria\u2019s attempts to regulate the industry have perhaps not been as successful as the country hoped, based on the data snapshot from the report. The survey took place from May to June earlier this year, with some onchain data being gathered through July. Nigeria arrested Gambaryan at the end of February. \u201cNigerians love stablecoins,\u201d Carter noted. Perhaps the country even has a right to be \u201cparanoid,\u201d given that the full survey results show that Nigeria came out on top in every category. Users in the country \u201ctransact most frequently, stablecoins compose the largest share of respondent portfolios, they report the highest share of non-crypto-trading uses for stablecoins, and they maintain the highest self-reported knowledge of stablecoins,\u201d the report stated. Other countries such as Turkey had different uses for stablecoins (the report found that Turkish users tend to use them to earn yield, with trading closely following). \u201cI think there actually is a crypto dollarization event happening in Nigeria, as far as I can tell, where people are actively deserting the naira and going to dollars via stablecoins. I think this is ongoing. It\u2019s the first real crypto dollarization event,\u201d Carter told me. He did warn that he\u2019s not sure if you can \u201cquantify that 15% of [naira\u2019s] devaluation is due to crypto,\u201d especially given that the survey targeted crypto users. But the results show that perhaps Nigeria has a right to show concern. Nigeria aside, the study was able to show that stablecoins, when used by some in emerging markets, allow access US dollar exposure, which could be interpreted as a boon for the US. But, as stated above, there isn\u2019t currently a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, even as Circle \u2014 the firm behind USDC \u2014 seeks to go public. But Carter also thinks that the issuers are \u201cstymied\u201d because none of them can issue interest-bearing stablecoins. \u201cAll of the interest bearing stablecoins, they\u2019re issued overseas,\u201d he said. Carter pointed to Paxos, which has an interest-bearing stablecoin in Dubai despite being a US-based company. Offerings from Mountain Protocol and Ethena are also offshore. \u201c\u2026I do think that the interest-bearing stablecoins will out-compete the ordinary ones at the margin with time. So they can\u2019t do that in the US, because the [Securities and Exchange Commission] is so adamant that it makes it a security, right? So that\u2019s one of the issues that\u2019s\u2026hobbled us for now,\u201d Carter explained. The report points out there\u2019s not one single answer to address why stablecoins are so heavily dollarized. \u201cThe US dollar is the global reserve currency but in no other category of usage does it dominate to the same extent it does with stablecoins,\u201d it pointed out. But there\u2019s no denying that it seems to have hit its mark with stablecoins. Now time will tell if the US will take advantage of that.

They aren\u2019t just a trading tool, and the result is something far more powerful than we\u2019ve perhaps ever realized. Newsletter Subscribe to Empire Newsletter  \u2014 Katherine Ross Word is going around that Tether earns more profit than BlackRock. Kinda, but also not. Tether has made it a habit of reporting quarterly profit numbers alongside its attestation reports. Those reports describe the assets in the pool of reserves that give tethers their value. As of its most recent attestation, for the end of Q2, there was almost $118.44 billion backing the tethers in circulation \u2014 conveniently over $5 billion more. Which means all tethers were all properly backed by an equivalent value of assets in reserve, and then some. (It\u2019s worth noting that attestations are not audits and Tether has never actually been \u201caudited,\u201d for reasons.) Short-dated US Treasurys made up around 68% of Tether reserves, with reverse repurchase agreements, money market funds, secured loans and bitcoin the next largest categories. Tether reported $1.3 billion in quarterly profit alongside that Q2 disclosure. A staggering amount considering how few people it employs \u2014 believed to be under 100. Most of that profit comes from the US Treasurys it buys. Three-month Treasury bills currently carry a rate of 4.85%, and considering Tether owned almost $81 billion worth, the 10-figure profit sounds about right. What isn\u2019t usually discussed is that Tether is lumping in the profit from US Treasurys with the mark-to-market gains of its bitcoin and gold holdings, as outlined in one of its blog posts. And it\u2019s inflating Tether\u2019s profit numbers. Take this year\u2019s first quarter. Tether reported a throat-tightening $4.52 billion in profit. At the same time, the price of bitcoin went up almost 70%, which Tether apparently considers free profit. Tether reported that its bitcoin holdings increased in value by $2.56 billion throughout that period \u2014 from $2.82 billion to $5.37 billion. The firm appears to have bought 8888.88 BTC throughout the quarter, going by the attestations and its onchain history, but we don\u2019t know at what price Tether bought those coins. If we take the average price of bitcoin over the quarter, Tether would\u2019ve spent $481.5 million on that BTC. Subtract that from the increase in value and you get Tether\u2019s quarterly \u201cbitcoin profit\u201d: $2.08 billion, or 46% of the total that Tether reported. US Treasurys would\u2019ve otherwise contributed 51% while gold\u2019s price appreciation perhaps gave around 3%. While bitcoin made up less than 5% of Tether\u2019s reserve portfolio, it contributed nearly half of its reported quarterly profits. This, of course, means that Tether\u2019s profits are reduced when the prices of bitcoin and gold go down. Tether reported only $1.3 billion in profit in Q2, down nearly 70% from the prior quarter, even though it held almost $6 billion more in US Treasurys. The difference is largely because the price of bitcoin fell 12% between quarters, so the value of Tether\u2019s bitcoin went down by $648 million. Had bitcoin retained its value, Tether would\u2019ve reported almost $2 billion in quarterly profit. So, does Tether earn more profit than BlackRock? Lumping in bitcoin and gold appreciation in with US Treasurys profits, sure. Tether has to actually continue buying US Treasurys to earn money from them, but it doesn\u2019t have to do anything to report its bitcoin and gold profits, only hold. But by that system, Tether has reported earning $12.72 billion in net profit since Q4 2022, compared to BlackRock\u2019s $9.829 billion. If you only count Tether\u2019s disclosed profits without bitcoin and gold, Tether would\u2019ve made under $7.7 billion. Still monstrous, sure, but falls just shy of outpacing the world\u2019s largest asset manager. Tether is likely, in any case, the most profitable crypto company in the world, and one of the most profitable outside of it as well. Depending on your definitions of profit, it might still need a few more years to eclipse BlackRock \u2014 but it seems inevitable. \u2014 David Canellis Q: Do crypto crackdowns work? Doubtful. When the technology is applied correctly, it\u2019s generally resilient to most kinds of crackdowns. In January 2022 \u2014 four months after China effectively banned bitcoin mining in multiple regions \u2014 the mainland still contributed an estimated 20% of bitcoin\u2019s hash rate, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, which unfortunately is no longer updated. Granted, it\u2019s difficult to know for sure where bitcoin miners are coming from. Cambridge was using IP addresses to derive locations, which can be muddied with VPNs and the like. There are otherwise anecdotes that suggest bitcoin mining is indeed still happening in China. Similarly, ransomware is still prevalent despite the US government crackdown that started in 2021. And Tether is still the number-one stablecoin by far, even after all of its battles with authorities. Might things have been much worse if there were no crackdowns at all? Perhaps. So, whether that means they\u2019ve \u201cworked\u201d is probably more political than empirical. \u2014 David Canellis If we\u2019re talking about a government or regulator trying to step in after crypto has found some niche use cases in the population, then I don\u2019t think so. This, I think, is especially true when it comes to economies or countries where there are either gaps in the financial system, or the population\u2019s financial needs are not fully being met. That is one of the core designs of crypto, after all. Take Nigeria. The country took action earlier this year, hoping to swiftly curtail the amount of crypto activity going on. But the data from the survey shows that many are still finding ways to access and utilize crypto. The US, though far different in its financial set up, is similar. It may be an uncomfortable sector to work in until proper regulation is in place, but that\u2019s not killing or stifling innovation. \u2014 Katherine Ross"

        "body": "\u201cThis is a unique opportunity for us to develop the infrastructure to support regulated digital assets in the United States,\u201d Alan Konevsky, chief legal officer at tZero, told Blockworks. The license permits tZero to custody digital asset securities, similar to Prometheum Inc., which became the first digital asset firm to obtain this type of license last year. Both companies must treat any custodied tokens as securities, regardless of how issuers themselves identity them.

Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  \u201cIt\u2019s fine to say that a number of these assets should be treated as securities,\u201d Konevsky said. \u201cWhat\u2019s not fine is to take that position and not permit the marketplace to develop the right kind of regulated infrastructure to support digital asset security trading. That\u2019s not really consistent with the position and objective that these are regulated assets and you need to treat them that way.\u201d A day after tZero announced its license, Prometheum revealed additional assets that will be supported on its newly-launched institutional custodian platform: Optimism (OP) and The Graph (GRT). Prometheum previously said that its platform will include ETH, Uniswap (UNI) and Arbitrum (ARB). tZero, Konevsky said, \u201cwill support custody of any digital asset security that it can lawfully custody, pursuant to guidance from the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and FINRA.\u201d This includes potential assets that were not initially issued as registered securities but ones \u201cthe SEC now deems to be securities,\u201d he added, provided regulators create a \u201cpathway\u201d for how these assets can be legally traded by a broker dealer. \u201cTo our knowledge, this guidance has not been provided for the kinds of assets that Prometheum identified in its filings,\u201d Konevsky said. \u201cWe would welcome guidance and clarity from the regulators on how we can lawfully support those types of assets, and then we\u2019ll execute on that guidance,\u201d he added. Prometheum CEO Benjamin Kaplan said his firm \u201cis able to offer custody of digital asset securities through its SPBD.\u201d \u201cAs of today we are open for business for financial institutions, corporates or institutional investors seeking a qualified custodian to custody ETH, ARB, UNI, OP and GRT and very much look forward to continuing to expand those offerings across the wide spectrum of digital asset securities,\u201d Kaplan added. tZero plans to launch its custody service early next year, the company said, with its first asset being the firm\u2019s own preferred stock, TZROP, which has been trading since 2019.

        "body": "eToro was charged with operating as an unregistered broker in connection with its crypto trading platform. As part of the settlement, eToro will end most of its crypto trading activity on the platform, according to the Thursday announcement from the SEC. Earlier this week, eToro announced that it would alter its crypto offerings \u201cdue to the regulatory environment.\u201d Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  US users can only trade bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether. Other positions will be liquidated in mid-March of next year. \u201cProceeds from these liquidations will be transferred to users\u2019 available cash balance in their investment accounts,\u201d the company added. Additionally, eToro will pay the SEC $1.5 million to settle the charges, and the company walks away without admitting or denying the findings from the SEC. \u201cThe SEC\u2019s order finds that, since at least 2020, eToro operated as a broker and clearing agency by providing U.S. customers the ability, through eToro\u2019s online trading platform, to trade crypto assets being offered and sold as securities, but eToro did not comply with the registration provisions of the federal securities laws,\u201d the SEC said. \u201cBy removing tokens offered as investment contracts from its platform, eToro has chosen to come into compliance and operate within our established regulatory framework. This resolution not only enhances investor protection, but also offers a pathway for other crypto intermediaries,\u201d SEC\u2019s Gurbir Grewal said. This is not the first time that the SEC\u2019s targeted a financial services company. The SEC previously issued Robinhood a Wells notice, though it has yet to announce any formal legal action following the notice."
