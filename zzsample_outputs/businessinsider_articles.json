        "body": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has started its three-day monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday. The meeting will conclude on Thursday, when the RBI will announce its decisions on the repo rate and other matters.The repo rate, which has been maintained at 6.5 per cent since it was last increased in February 2023, is widely expected by experts to remain unchanged for the ninth consecutive bi-monthly policy review.Experts highlight that inflation in India remains above the RBI's target range, making it unlikely that the central bank will implement policy cuts until inflation reaches the target of 4 per cent. However, the expert added that the RBI may consider rate cuts in the October meeting.Banking expert Ashutosh Khajuria commented: \"Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) may continue to hold the policy signalling Repo rate and wait for Consumer Price Inflation to decisively fall below 4 per cent, the target rate. For the present, the continuation of the current stance is widely expected. MPC in India may change the stance and rate action by the beginning of the second half of the year in their October meeting at the earliest.\"The experts also noted that while core inflation has been contained and commodity prices, particularly metals, have dropped by 15-20 per cent from their 2024 peak, food inflation remains a concern and needs to be closely monitored to ensure stability in overall CPI numbers.The Managing Director of a major bank, who preferred not to be named, told ANI: \"During the last policy meeting we could see some voting in favour of a rate cut. At the same time, we could see The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on July 11 said it is too early to talk on the interest rate cut due to the uncertain economic environment and inflation remaining close to five per cent. Considering both, our expectation is that the rate cut cycle may start from the next meeting and no change in interest rates this time.\"RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had also emphasised in the last policy briefing that food inflation is still a concern and that the regulator is not in a hurry to make a decision on rate cuts.A recent report by the State Bank of India (SBI) also noted that Consumer Price Inflation in India is expected to remain around 5 per cent for the financial year 2024-25, except for the months of September and October.

        "body": "Electric vehicle sales registered a 55.2 per cent on-year growth at 1,79,038 units in July driven by a massive 96 per cent jump in e-two-wheeler sales, automobile dealers' body FADA said on Tuesday. The total electric vehicles sales for July 2023 were at 1,16,221 units, according to the monthly sales data from Federation of Automobile Dealers' Association (FADA).  The electric two-wheelers sales during the previous month stood at 1,07,016 units, up 95.94 per cent, from 54,616 units sold in July last year, while the electric three-wheeler sales grew 18.18 per cent at 63,667 units, from 58,873 units year earlier, as per FADA.  The commercial vehicle sales during the reporting month was also on an upward trajectory, growing two-fold on a year-on-year basis to 816 units, from 364 commercial vehicles sold in July 2023, it stated.  Passenger vehicles, however, declined 2.92 per cent at 7,541 units in July, as against 7,768 units in the same month of last year, as per data.  \"The rising market share in the 2W and 3W EV segments for July 2024, with YoY growth rates of 95.94 per cent and 18.18 per cent respectively, and a market share of 7.4 per cent and 57.6 per cent, respectively for the month, is a clear indication of the growing acceptance and demand for electric vehicles in India,\" FADA President Manish Raj Singhania said.  The PV segment, while showing a marginal year-on-year decline of 2.92 per cent, maintains a market share of 2.4 per cent, Singhania said, adding that the CV segment has shown remarkable growth with a year-on-year increase of 124.2 per cent and a current (July) market share of 1.02 per cent.  The combination of attractive discounts and the anticipation of the discontinuation of the EMPS (Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme), despite its extension, has significantly boosted sales, he said.  Announced by the Ministry of Heavy Industries in March, for a four months period-April 1,2024 to July 31,2024 to boost the adoption of EVs across the country with a total outlay of Rs 500 crore, the EMP scheme has now been extended by September 30, while the scheme's outlay has also been increased to Rs 778 crore.SEE ALSO: Unicommerce eSolutions IPO \u2013 Price band to risk factors, all you need to know  Electric two-wheeler sales cross the 1 lakh mark after four months, Ola Electric leads the market Neeraj Chopra qualifies for finals with a first throw of 89.34m \u2013 top rivals to look out for"

        "body": "Banks have written off loans worth Rs 9.90 lakh crore in the last five financial years, Parliament was informed on Tuesday. During 2023-24, banks loan write off was at Rs 1.70 lakh crore, as against Rs 2.08 lakh crore in the previous fiscal, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.  Write-off was highest at Rs 2.34 lakh crore during 2019-20, which came down to Rs 2.02 lakh crore in the following year and to Rs 1.74 lakh crore in 2021-22.  As per the RBI guidelines and policy approved by banks' boards, NPAs, including those in respect of which full provisioning has been made on completion of four years, are removed from the balance-sheet of the bank concerned by way of write-off, he said.  \"Banks evaluate/consider the impact of write-offs as part of their regular exercise to clean up their balance-sheet, avail tax benefit and optimise capital, in accordance with the said guidelines and policies of the respective boards,\" he said in a reply to a question asked by Congress member Randeep Singh Surjewala.  Such write-off does not result in waiver of liabilities of borrowers to repay and therefore, write-off does not benefit the borrowers, he said.  The borrowers of written-off loans continue to be liable for repayment and banks continue to pursue recovery actions initiated in written-off accounts through various recovery mechanisms available to them, he added.  Against Rs 9.9 lakh crore write-off, recovery was to the tune of Rs 1.84 lakh crore, or just 18 per cent of total write-off during the last 5 years.  As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, he said, gross NPAs (GNPA) of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) was Rs 8,96,082 crore (GNPA ratio of 8.21 per cent) as on March 31, 2020, Rs 8,35,051 crore (GNPA ratio of 7.33 per cent) as on March 31, 2021, Rs 7,42,397 crore (GNPA ratio of 5.82 per cent) as on March 31, 2022.  It further came down to Rs 5,71,544 crore (GNPA ratio of 3.87 per cent) as on March 31, 2023 and to Rs 4,80,687 crore (GNPA ratio of 2.75 per cent) as on March 31, 2024 (provisional data).  It indicates that gross NPAs in SCBs have been declining over the past five years, he added.  Replying to another question Chaudhary said, the Indian banking sector remained largely insulated from the recent crises involving other global financial entities.  The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of Indian banks during January-June 2024 remained above 130 per cent against the regulatory threshold of 100 per cent indicating resilience to liquidity risks.  At the same time, he said, the investment portfolio of the Indian banks has remained largely resilient to the market risks arising due to adverse price movements.  While the SCBs incurred losses to the tune of Rs 32,437 crore during 2017-18, their net profit has improved to Rs 3,41,672 crore during 23-24, he said.  The capital position (CRAR) of SCBs has improved to 16.84 per cent as on March 31, 2024 from 13.85 per cent as on March 31, 2018.  On the issue of fake currency, Chaudhary said, it has come down to 2,22,639 in FY24, as against 2,22,639 in the previous fiscal.  Further, the National Investigation Agency has registered 39 cases related to Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) since withdrawal of legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in the year 2016, in which counterfeit Indian currency of face value Rs 8,50,62,500 have been seized, he said.  The government in consultation with its various agencies and the Reserve Bank of India takes necessary steps to curtail the use and circulation of fake currency in the country from time to time, he said.  New security features are also introduced in Indian banknotes from time to time to enhance their anti-counterfeiting properties, he added.SEE ALSO: Unicommerce eSolutions IPO \u2013 Price band to risk factors, all you need to know  Electric two-wheeler sales cross the 1 lakh mark after four months, Ola Electric leads the market Neeraj Chopra qualifies for finals with a first throw of 89.34m \u2013 top rivals to look out for"

        "body": "The High Commission of India in London on Tuesday issued a safety advisory for Indian nationals to \"stay vigilant and exercise due caution\" amid ongoing violent clashes which have targeted immigrants and asylum-seekers in parts of the UK since last week. The advisory posted on the social media channels of the Indian mission also provides emergency contact information for anyone in need of urgent assistance. It comes a week after the fatal stabbing of three young girls in Southport, north-west England, and incorrect social media claims over the UK-born suspect's asylum-seeker status.  \"Indian travellers would be aware of recent disturbances in some parts of the United Kingdom. The High Commission of India in London is closely monitoring the situation,\" reads the message entitled 'Advisory for Indian Citizens Visiting the UK.'  \"Visitors from India are advised to stay vigilant and exercise due caution while travelling in the UK. It is advisable to follow local news and advisories issued by local security agencies, and to avoid areas where protests are underway,\" it added.  The contact provided for India House at Aldwych, London, in case of an emergency is: +44-2078369147 and inf.london@mea.gov.in.  Birmingham in the north and Plymouth in southern England witnessed the latest scenes of clashes between two sets of protesters overnight on Monday.  A man is in a serious condition in hospital after being attacked in a suspected hate crime in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and police officers were attacked with bricks in Darlington, northern England. PTI AK  The British government said it has accelerated its plans to deal with prison capacity to ensure sufficient space for an expected rise in prisoners due to rioting after hundreds of arrests have been made.  \"I think we have seen serious acts of violence designed to cause terror to a section of our community,\" Neil Basu, the former head of counter-terrorism policing, told the BBC.  Basu also blamed social media companies for not taking tough enough action to clampdown on misinformation and said \"we should be appealing\" to advertisers to cut the funding of social media giants if responsibility was not exercised.  Meanwhile, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology are investigating the role of foreign state actors amplifying misinformation and disinformation about the UK riots, including cracking down on automated online bots.  \"Clearly we have seen bot activity online, much of which may well be amplified with the involvement of state actors amplifying some of the disinformation and misinformation that we've seen,\" said Prime Minister Keir Starmer's official spokesperson, but declined to say which states may be involved.  On Monday after a high-level COBRA security meeting, Starmer pledged a \"standing army\" of specialist officers to stamp out the riots across several cities in the country, which he has termed as \"far-right thuggery.\"  \"I've asked for the early consideration of the earliest naming and identification of those involved in the process, who will feel the full force of the law,\" he said.  Many of his own Labour Party MPs and Opposition members are calling for Parliament to be recalled from its summer recess to debate the issue, but Starmer has so far insisted the government needs to focus on restoring calm on the streets.  The trigger of the riots lies in Southport, near Liverpool, which was the scene of the stabbing of a group of young children at a Taylor Swift themed dance class on July 29. Axel Rudakubana, 17, who has been charged with three murders and other attempted murders, was born in Cardiff, Wales, to Rwandan parents. However, initial false social media posts claimed he was a refugee who arrived last year on a small boat.SEE ALSO: Unicommerce eSolutions IPO \u2013 Price band to risk factors, all you need to know Neeraj Chopra\u2019s Paris Olympics journey to begin with qualification round today \u2013 top rivals to look out for Electric two-wheeler sales cross the 1 lakh mark after four months, Ola Electric leads the market"

        "body": "The IPO of Brainbees Solutions Ltd, popularised by its brand FirstCry, opened for subscription today and will close on August 8, 2024. The company is looking to raise Rs 4,193.73 crore, out of which Rs 1,666 crore will come via a fresh issue and the remaining Rs 2,527 crore will be garnered through an offer for sale (OFS). Only 10% of the total issue has been made available to retail investors, while 15% is reserved for NII (Non institutional investors) and the remaining 75% will be taken up by QIBs (Qualified Institutional Buyers). The share allotment will be finalised on August 9th, followed by refunds and crediting of shares, which will take place on August 12th. Trading is set to commence on both BSE and NSE from August 13th, 2024.The company plans to utilise these funds to set up new modern stores for its other brand, BabyHug, investing in Digital Age, one of its subsidiaries, expansion purposes and setting up warehouses in India and KSA, among others. India's booming childcare marketPresently, India has the largest population of children globally, with approximately 306 million children under 12 years of age as of July 1, 2023, and a birth rate of 16.3 births per thousand people in 2022. In fact, population aged 0-12 accounts for approximately 21% of India\u2019s population as of 2023.The company has substantial headroom for growth, given that childcare products spending per capita in India is currently nascent (between Rs 9,280-9,350) in FY24. It is projected to at a CAGR of 13-15%, which is higher than those in mature markets, between FY24 and FY29. And historically, except for health & food in childcare products, the entire childcare market has been low on brand penetration. There are only a handful number of large multi-category childcare product brands, amongst which FirstCry has made a distinct name for itself. About the companyFirstCry claims to be India's largest multi-channel retailing platform selling products specifically catering to mothers, babies and kids. Apart from its online platform, it also operates 1,063 modern stores in total across 533 Indian cities, up from 904 stores in 2023. The company functions across various channels, which includes its online platform, which is also present in UAE and KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), apart from India, and modern stores within the country. As of March 31, 2024, the company had 556 franchise partners, 9 warehouse partners, 302 logistics partners and 567 distributors. The company is a popular name in mothers, babies and kids segment, with more than 1.65 million SKUs (stock keeping units) from more than 7,580 brands on its multi-channel platform across the clothing and fashion, toys, books, school supplies, diapers, bath and skin care, feeding and nursing, health and safety, baby gear, and maternity categories. The company's GMV has also seen a steady growth, from Rs 52,390 million in FY22 to Rs 75,827 million in FY24. The company has been steadily ramping up its offline presence, with physical stores making up 23.09% of the company's India GMV in 2024, up from 18.42% in 2022. Conversely, the portion of online sales (as a part of total GMV) has come down from 81.58% in FY22 to 76.91% in FY24. According to company's RHP (red herring prospectus), 37.07% of company's total GMV (gross merchandise value) in 2024 stems from South India, up from 35.96% in 2022. The share of North India in the company's total GMV has largely been consistent, from 27.25% in 2022 to 27.56% in 2024. But contribution of west India dipped from 24.03% in 2022 to 21.55% in 2024. The company\u2019s revenues from operations also grew from Rs 24,012.9 million in FY22 to Rs 64,808.6 million in FY24. Additionally, the company's bottom line has been in red for the last 3 years, along with its cash flows. It incurred losses worth Rs 786.85 million in FY22, which burgeoned to Rs 4,860.56 million in FY23. However, the company has been able to contain its losses, which stood at Rs 3,215.07 million in FY24. Notably, the company has a high level of dependency on its relationships with third-party manufacturers, particularly for its home brand products. Also, it does not have exclusive agreements with contract manufacturers, suppliers, and third-party brands. As such, a sudden termination or adverse impact on any of its stakeholders is bound to dent the company's financials as well. Expert OpinionSays Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart Ltd,\"Brainbees has encountered financial challenges, incurring losses for the past three years despite revenue growth. Negative cash flows further underscore these concerns. The company operates in a highly competitive landscape and relies on third-party manufacturers, suppliers, and brands for its product offerings\". \"Due to the absence of profitability, a meaningful P/E valuation cannot be determined. Additionally, the lack of comparable listed peers limits comparative analysis. Consequently, we maintain a neutral stance on the IPO and advise investors to conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment\".Kuber Chauhan, analyst at Anand Rathi Research, \"At the upper price band company is valuing at Marketcap/Sales of3.7x with a market cap of \u20b924,142 million post issue of equity shares. Therefore, on the valuation front, we believe that the company is richly priced. Thus, we recommend a \u201cSubscribe\u201d rating to the IPO\". "

        "body": "Mining conglomerate Vedanta Ltd on Tuesday reported 36.5 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 3,606 crore for June quarter FY25 due to improved margins and robust cost reduction across all operations. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 2,640 crore in the year-ago period.  Income rose to Rs 36,698 crore over Rs 34,279 crore in the year-ago period, according to an exchange filing.  Vedanta said in a statement that the proposed demerger of its businesses is on track and it has already filed the demerger scheme with NCLT after getting a nod from secured creditors.  The company said that its board has approved a capex investment of USD 270 million for its oil and gas business.  \"The strategic priority for the Cairn Oil & Gas business is to augment reserves and increase near term volume through infill wells and enhanced oil recovery. In order to deliver this, the Board has approved capex investment (net) of USD 270 million across fields in the Rajasthan block for drilling wells and construction of surface facility for ASP ( Alkaline Surfactant Polymer) injection,\" the company said in a separate filing.  Vedanta Executive Director Arun Misra said that the company has delivered a strong start to the year, with exceptional EBITDA improvement of 47 per cent and PAT improvement by 54 per cent year-over-year on the back of improved margins, and robust cost reduction across all operations.  \"Our aluminium and zinc divisions continue to outperform industry benchmarks, consistently ranking in the top quartiles and deciles of the global cost curve. These achievements are a direct result of our strategic focus on cost, as reflected in a 20 per cent year-over-year reduction in overall cost,\" he said.  The company's growth projects are well on track and it remains committed to commission the majority of these projects in FY25.  \"Moving ahead, our focus on operational efficiency, sustained expansion, and ESG excellence will guide our journey. With this dedication, we are confident in our ability to create substantial shareholder value in the year ahead,\" he added.  Last month, the mining conglomerate raised Rs 8,500 crore (over USD 1 billion) through Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP) of 19.31 crore equity shares at an issue price of Rs 440 per share.  Company's CFO Ajay Goel said, \"The overwhelming response to the Vedanta's... QIP...underscores investors' huge confidence. The proceeds from the QIP will be further instrumental in deleveraging the balance sheet and reduction of finance costs. We have received all the requisite approvals and have filed the demerger scheme with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) taking our demerger a step closer to reality.\"  The company's gross debt stood at Rs 78,016 crore as on June 30, 2024.  Vedanta Ltd, a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources Ltd, is one of the world's leading natural resources companies spanning across India, South Africa, Namibia, Liberia, the UAE, Korea, Taiwan and Japan with significant operations in oil and gas, zinc, lead, silver, copper, iron ore, steel, nickel, aluminium, power and glass substrate.SEE ALSO: Unicommerce eSolutions IPO \u2013 Price band to risk factors, all you need to know  Electric two-wheeler sales cross the 1 lakh mark after four months, Ola Electric leads the market Neeraj Chopra qualifies for finals with a first throw of 89.34m \u2013 top rivals to look out for"

        "body": "Various AI companies have been accused of data scraping in the pastReddit CEO recently asked Microsoft to pay for using its website contentMidjourney announced a ban on Stability AI employees in March this yearOpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022 and the world hasn\u2019t been the same since then. From writing content and composing poetry to helping with research and writing code, the AI chatbot can do things that were earlier considered to be exclusive to human beings. After ChatGPT\u2019s launch, several other companies including Microsoft and Google also launched their own AI chatbots. Today, chatbots from various companies are being widely used by people for various purposes. But do you know where the chatbots get their information from? One source is the data you enter while talking to the chatbot (same is mentioned in the form of disclaimers and you can even opt out of them). The other is data from online sources which is mostly the content created by other individuals and companies available publicly. And this has been a source of debate for a long time. Microsoft AI division CEO Mustafa Suleyman was in the news last month for saying that anyone can use the data available on the internet. However, Reddit CEO opposes this viewpoint and was recently making headlines for asking Microsoft to pay for using the data on Reddit. In the last few months, there have been various reports of content creators, actors, and companies taking action against AI companies for scraping their data to train their own AI models. Let us take a look at some of them.1. MicrosoftLast week, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman made headlines for demanding that companies like Microsoft should pay for using the site\u2019s data to train their AI models. A report in The Verge quoted Huffman saying that without such agreements, Reddit has no control over how its data is used or displayed, leading them to block companies unwilling to negotiate. He specifically called out Microsoft, Anthropic, and Perplexity for refusing to come to terms.The Verge report added that Huffman also accused Microsoft of using Reddit\u2019s data to train its AI and summarise content in Bing results without informing the platform. He also mentioned that Reddit\u2019s data has been sold through the Bing API to other search engines. Referencing Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman\u2019s comment, Huffman said that Microsoft, Anthropic, and Perplexity seem to believe all internet content is free for their use.2. Stability AIIn March this year, Midjourney announced a ban on Stability AI employees from using its service, accusing them of causing a system outage by scraping Midjourney's data. On March 2nd, Midjourney reported on its Discord server that a prolonged server outage prevented generated images from displaying in user galleries, attributing the issue to \"botnet-like activity from paid accounts\" linked to Stability AI employees.According to a report in The Verge, during a business update call on March 6th, Midjourney claimed the outage occurred because \"someone at Stability AI was trying to grab all the prompt and image pairs in the middle of the night on Saturday.\" The company traced multiple paid accounts back to a member of Stability AI's data team. Consequently, Midjourney indefinitely banned all Stability AI employees from using its service and introduced a new policy to ban employees from any company involved in \"aggressive automation\" or causing service outages.3. RunwayGoogle-backed AI startup Runway was in the limelight last month for accusations of scraping thousands of YouTube videos without authorisation to train its AI video creation model. The allegations came to light through a leaked internal spreadsheet obtained by 404 Media.The spreadsheet, allegedly shared by a former Runway employee, outlined plans to categorise and tag content from over 3,900 YouTube channels, including big names like Disney, Netflix, and well-known YouTubers such as Casey Neistat and Marques Brownlee (MKBHD). This data was purportedly used to develop Runway's Gen-3 AI video creation model, previously known as \"Jupiter.\"Runway did not verify the authenticity of the spreadsheet. The company had earlier claimed it used \"curated, internal datasets\" for training but did not disclose further details.Prominent YouTubers like MKBHD and MrWhoseTheBoss voiced their concerns on social media about the whole incident. MKBHD disclosed that over 1,600 of his videos had been scraped, while MrWhoseTheBoss described the practice as \"scary,\" revealing that 1,600 of his videos were also used.4. OpenAIIn May this year, Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson sued OpenAI for using her voice likeness without asking for permission. OpenAI, on the other hand, had claimed that the voice in question belonged to other actors and not Johansson. Later that month, it was revealed that ChatGPT\u2019s Sky voice (the voice in question) was being taken down.Johansson had also said that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had approached her twice for allowing them to clone her voice for the AI chatbot. However, she had declined the offer.Meanwhile Altman, in an interview with NBC News, said that Sky was not based on Johansson's voice. He explained that a professional actor recorded the voice, but the actor's identity cannot be revealed for privacy reasons. \"We cast the voice actor behind Sky\u2019s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson. Out of respect for Ms. Johansson, we have paused using Sky\u2019s voice in our products. We are sorry to Ms. Johansson that we didn\u2019t communicate better,\" he had said.5. AnthropicAmerican AI startup Anthropic also found itself in the middle of a controversy last month. The startup faced accusations of aggressively scraping data from various websites to train its systems.A report in Financial Times said that Matt Barrie, CEO of Freelancer.com, claimed that Anthropic was \"the most aggressive scraper by far\" of his freelancing portal, which sees millions of daily visits.Other web publishers echoed Barrie\u2019s concerns, stating that Anthropic's bots were inundating their sites and ignoring requests to stop collecting content for training purposes. Freelancer.com recorded 3.5 million visits from an Anthropic-linked web crawler within just four hours, according to data shared with the Financial Times. Barrie noted that this volume was \"probably about five times the number two\" AI crawler.Despite attempts to block access using standard web protocols, visits from Anthropic's bots continued to rise, prompting Barrie to block traffic from Anthropic\u2019s internet addresses entirely.Anthropic responded by stating that it was investigating the issue and aimed to respect publishers' requests, striving not to be \"intrusive or disruptive.\"The Financial Times also quoted Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit.com, who reported receiving 1 million hits from Anthropic bots in 24 hours. \"We have a load of alarms [for high traffic], people get woken up at 3am. This set off every alarm we have,\" Wiens said.SEE ALSO: Sam Altman and generative AI can't be trusted, says leading expertElon Musk is having another go at suing OpenAI and Sam Altman \u2014 here's why"

        "body": "Sensex and Nifty closed the day in the red. While Sensex dipped around 166 points to close at 78,593.07, well below the 80,000 mark it had breached recently, Nifty closed 0.26% down at 23,992.55, marginally below the 24,000 mark, as of August 6th, 2024. Britannia (up by 2.81%), JSW Steel (up by 2.35%), Tech Mahindra (up by 1.74%), Larsen and Toubro (up by 1.70%) and Hindustan Unilever (up by 1.54%) were amongst the top gainers during the day. On the other hand, HDFC Life (down by 4.28%), SBI Life (down by 2.43%), BPCL (1.84%), Shri Ram Finance (down by 1.71%) and SBI Life (down by 1.47%) were the leading laggards. Out of the 2,813 stocks traded during the day, 1,031 stocks saw advances, while 1,703 saw declines, and another 79 remained unchanged. 72 stocks hit their 52-week high price, while 51 stocks also hit their 52-week low price today. 108 stocks hit the upper circuit, or maximum permissible price in a single trading session, while 131 stocks remained in the lower circuit. All broad market indices closed the day in red. India VIX dipped 7.97%, and amidst sectoral indices, financial services and PSU banks dropped over 1% each at the close of day's trade. With the exception of FMCG, IT, media, metal and realty, which managed marginal gains, all other sectors closed in the reds. Aditya Gaggar, director of Progressive Shares explains that although a strong opening reaching higher levels was seen in the opening trade; the index failed to hold its gains and gradually erased it. In the 2nd half of trading, selling pressure intensified, and the index wiped off all its gains to end the session at 23,992.55 with a loss of 63.05 points. \"A mixed trend was seen across the board, where realty and IT were the top gainers, while PSU Banks corrected the most, followed by auto. From the broader markets, midcaps and small caps corrected by 0.61% & 0.39% respectively, and underperformed the frontline index. The near-term outlook for Nifty50 turned bearish, unless it gives a convincing move above 24,400 while on the downside, 23,880 will be considered as immediate support\", Gaggar continued. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities noted that while today, the markets opened higher due to positive Asian markets, they failed to sustain these levels and closed at the day's lowest point. \"Although the market did not break the previous day's lows, it closed below the closing of the previous day. Apart from Nifty realty, metal, and IT, other indices closed in the red. Based on the short-term market structure, the trend-setting levels are 23,900/78,290. If the market falls below this, it may decline to 23,700 or 23,600/78,000-77,800, where it has support from retracements and long-term averages. It's advisable to consider selective buying around this level. On the upside, the major resistance levels are 24,150/79,000 and 24,400/79,700. It's recommended to reduce weak long positions around 24,300/24,400\", he said. On the global front, oil prices rose by over 1% today, bouncing back from yesterday's losses, due to supply concerns stemming from the escalating Middle East conflict and strong U.S. services data. However, the fear of Iran retaliating against recent attacks in the region has increased fears of a broader war, threatening global supply stability and impacting oil forecasts. Furthermore, the US ISM Services PMI for July came in at 51.4, slightly above the month's forecast (51) and higher than June's reading (48.8). This is a positive sign, since it indicates a rebound in services sector, improvement in business activities, new orders and employment across  industries like finance, healthcare and more. \"With the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate strategy under scrutiny, any positive US economic data could support the case for rate cuts\", continued Chouhan. In response, global indices were seen trading in green. Nikkei 225 in particular, which had dropped around 12.4% yesterday, witnessing its worst crash since 1987, sharply rebounded about 3,217.04 points, or 10.23% to close at 34,675.46 points. "

        "body": "Hurricane Debby made landfall in Florida, US, on Monday, claiming at least four lives and plunging hundreds of thousands into darkness. Along with catastrophic rain, howling winds and perilous storm surges, the cyclone also delivered an unexpected cargo: 25 tightly-wrapped packages of cocaine!The storm, which struck the northern Big Bend region as a Category One hurricane before weakening to a tropical storm, inadvertently delivered a cache of drugs along Florida's southernmost tip.The packages, weighing about 31 kilograms, are valued at over $1 million! The substantial drug haul was found by a vigilant beachgoer, who promptly alerted the authorities.Interestingly, this is not an isolated incident. Back in July 2023, the mayor of Florida\u2019s Tampa had also stumbled upon 31 kgs of cocaine, washed ashore in the same region.Florida\u2019s southern region, along with the Florida Keys\u2014a chain of islands off the state\u2019s southern coast\u2014lie near Caribbean countries that are key transit points for cocaine trafficking from South America to Europe and North America.The combination of the Keys\u2019 geographical location and the prevalence of drug trafficking networks has made it a frequent site for such discoveries, particularly during storm seasons, when the ocean's turbulence can disrupt illicit shipments and wash them ashore.Beyond human encounters, this influx of drugs poses risks to local wildlife as well. The notorious tales of Florida sharks ingesting cocaine discarded into the Atlantic by smugglers add to the broader ecological consequences of such pollution."
