        "body": "(Reuters) -Rivian Automotive maintained its production forecast for the year on Tuesday and said it lost more per electric car delivered than analysts had expected as cost-cuts are yet to take effect. The EV maker, whose shares fell more than 5% in volatile trading after the bell, introduced offers on leases to boost sales, which helped the company beat revenue estimates after it cleared some of its inventory. \u201cThe challenge, of course, then is that in Q3 the inventory is depleted. So, we\u2019re rebuilding our inventory base. We expect deliveries in Q3 to be slightly below that in Q2,\u201d CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters. Rivian halted production for three weeks in the second quarter to implement efficiency-boosting assembly line upgrades, which it expects to help post its first profit margin in the last three months of the year. Cost reduction from the factory retooling will be realized largely in the second half of the year, Scaringe said. Rivian, which is still losing thousands of dollars for every vehicle it makes, has seen its order backlog fall in the recent quarters as deliveries increased and some customers canceled their reservations. The company said its loss amounted to 39% of a vehicle\u2019s sales price, greater than the LSEG estimates of 34%. Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 stood at $1.16 billion, compared with analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.14 billion. EV startups, including Rivian and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund-backed Lucid, have been bleeding cash as they struggle to balance escalating costs related to scaling production with the need to compete against industry leader Tesla and other automakers Ford and General Motors. The company said its cash and cash equivalents were $5.76 billion as of June 30, compared with $7.86 billion at 2023-end. Still, investors said Volkswagen Group\u2019s $5 billion investment in Rivian as part of a new joint venture to share expertise in EV architecture and software development could help sustain the U.S. EV maker\u2019s cash balance till it starts selling its R2 mid-size SUVs unveiled earlier this year. Rivian posted a net loss of $1.46 billion in the second quarter, wider than the $1.2 billion loss a year earlier. (Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)"

        "body": "ATLANTA (Reuters) -Tropical Storm Debby inundated coastal Georgia and South Carolina with a deluge of rain on Tuesday that could bring \u201ccatastrophic flooding\u201d to Charleston, Savannah and other cities in the southeastern United States, the National Hurricane Center said. At least six people have died in Florida and Georgia in the wake of the storm, which is expected to linger over the southeastern and mid-Atlantic coasts for days. \u201cDebby is expected to produce potentially historic rainfall\u00a0totals of 10 to 20 inches (25 cm and 51 cm), with maximum amounts of 25 inches (63.5 cm), bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of the eastern half of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina through Friday,\u201d the NHC said. The governors of those states have declared states of emergency. The storm featured 40-mile-per-hour (64 kph) winds as it chugged along slowly at 5 mph (8 kph) to the northeast, with its center located about 50 miles (80 km) east of Savannah, Georgia, on Tuesday night. Heavy rainfall could cause flooding in parts of the mid-Atlantic through Sunday, the Miami-based center said. More than 8 inches (20 cm) of rain have already fallen on Savannah and Valdosta, Georgia, the National Weather Service said. Charleston and Hilton Head, South Carolina, have received between 10 and 12 inches (25 and 30 cm) of rain so far, the weather service said, with more on the way. In Savannah, rain was coming down hard outside the landmark Bellwether House, a 16-room bed-and-breakfast in the city\u2019s historic district, but general manager Victoria Hill was not too concerned. \u201cThis place was built in 1876,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s built rock-solid, and you can imagine how many storms have hit over the last century.\u201d Hill said many tourists had canceled their reservations because of the storm, but a handful of guests were staying on. \u201cWe here, we\u2019re open and we\u2019re holding up. We\u2019ll all ride this out together.\u201d Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said more than 2 feet (61 cm) of rain was expected in his city before the storm passes. Even at low tide, storm surges of between 4 and 6 feet (1.2 and 1.8 meters) will prevent floodwaters from draining into the sea, he said. There are \u201cnot enough pumps in the world\u201d to handle that much rain, Cogswell said late on Monday. He has since extended a citywide curfew until Wednesday morning. \u201cNobody should be out on the streets in these conditions unless it is an absolute emergency,\u201d the mayor said. About 50 miles (80 km) west of Charleston, fears of a breach at the McGrady Dam in Colleton County, part of the state\u2019s Lowcountry, prompted the county sheriff\u2019s office to warn residents to evacuate immediately on Tuesday. Debby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast on Monday morning, dumping 8 to 16 inches (20 to 41 cm) of rain in parts of central Florida, according to local reports. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida and one near Valdosta, Georgia. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \u201conce-in-a-thousand-year\u201d rain event. \u201cThis will literally create islands in the city,\u201d Johnson said. Cedrick King, a businessman from coastal Brunswick, Georgia, said he and his family had packed up their belongings on Tuesday and were ready to make the five-hour drive to Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re headed north, far away from this storm,\u201d he said.

        "body": "(Reuters) \u2013 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will campaign alongside her new running mate, Tim Walz, on Wednesday, holding events in battleground states Wisconsin and Michigan that will offer an early test of his Midwestern credentials. The trip to Eau Claire in Wisconsin and Detroit in Michigan is the first campaign swing for Walz, the governor of nearby Minnesota, whom Harris chose as her vice presidential pick on Tuesday in the biggest political decision of her nascent White House bid that has energized Democrats and shaken up the race. The selection of Walz, an Army National Guard veteran and former teacher, adds geographic balance to a ticket with a Californian at the helm who needs a strong showing in the Midwest to win the Nov. 5 election. A former congressman who won elections in a Republican-leaning district, Walz has a record of appealing to the white, rural voters who have increasingly turned to Donald Trump, this year\u2019s Republican presidential nominee, over the years. Democrats regard Wisconsin and Michigan as near must-wins in the 2024 election, and they have loomed large for the party since Hillary Clinton\u2019s unexpected defeats there helped clinch Trump\u2019s 2016 win. Biden beat Trump in both states in 2020, but polls showed him facing a close battle in Michigan before he dropped out of the race last month, with much of the state\u2019s significant Arab and Muslim American population fuming over his administration\u2019s support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 attacks. The Republican vice presidential candidate, Senator JD Vance, was also set to speak in Eau Claire on Wednesday as part of a tour following Harris and Walz this week. The Democratic trip is expected to include more than a half dozen states likely to determine the winner of the election, as the campaign aims to introduce Walz, who is not well known nationally. At the pair\u2019s first rally together on Tuesday night in Philadelphia, Harris devoted much of her speech to highlighting Walz\u2019s background as a small town native, a high school social studies teacher and football coach and a Guardsman. Walz, a folksy, affable speaker, nevertheless did not hold back on Trump and Vance, repeating his viral comment that they are \u201cweird\u201d and criticizing them over abortion, crime and the economy. Harris\u2019 rise to the top of the Democratic ticket two weeks ago has dramatically reshaped the race. Polls show she has erased the lead that Trump had built during the final faltering weeks of Biden\u2019s campaign, and a re-energized Democratic Party has flooded her campaign with donations. The Harris campaign said it raised more than $20 million on Tuesday after announcing Walz as the vice presidential pick. Trump and Vance immediately cast Walz as too liberal, doubling down on criticism they have frequently leveled at Harris. \u201cThis is the most Radical Left duo in American history,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform. Vance, who spoke to reporters in Philadelphia hours before Walz\u2019s campaign debut, faulted the governor for his handling of protests after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white police officer in 2020. \u201cThe biggest problem with the Tim Walz pick, it\u2019s not Tim Walz himself. It\u2019s what it says about Kamala Harris \u2013 that when given the opportunity, she will bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party,\u201d Vance said. Walz, who was first elected Minnesota governor in 2018, has pursued progressive policies, including free school meals, measures to combat climate change, middle class tax cuts and enhanced paid leave for workers. Harris had considered several other candidates for her running mate, notably Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who some Democrats had backed given the importance of his home state in November\u2019s election.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran has been charged in the United States in connection with a foiled plot to assassinate a U.S. politician or government officials, the Justice Department said on Tuesday. Asif Merchant, 46, sought to recruit people in the United States to carry out the plot in retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards\u2019 top commander Qassem Soleimani in 2020, according to a criminal complaint. Merchant, who prosecutors allege spent time in Iran before traveling to the United States from Pakistan, was charged with murder for hire in federal court in New York\u2019s Brooklyn borough. A federal judge ordered him detained on July 17, according to court records. \u201cFor years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran\u2019s brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. FBI investigators believe that former President Donald Trump, who approved the drone strike on Soleimani, and other current and former U.S. government officials were the intended targets of the plot, CNN reported, citing a U.S. official. Court documents do not name the alleged targets of the plot. Merchant told a law enforcement informant that there would be \u201csecurity all around\u201d one target, according to the criminal complaint. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment further. Avraham Moskowitz, a lawyer for Merchant, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign could not immediately be reached for comment. Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 presidential election, was wounded in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last month. Garland said on Tuesday that investigators have found no evidence that Merchant had any connection to the shooting, which officials have said was carried out by a lone 20-year-old gunman. Law enforcement thwarted Merchant\u2019s plan before any attack was carried out. An individual Merchant contacted in April to help assist with the plot reported his activities to law enforcement and became a confidential informant, according to the complaint. Merchant told the informant his plans also included stealing documents from one target and organizing protests in the United States, prosecutors allege.

        "body": "CAIRO (Reuters) \u2013 Israeli forces on Wednesday issued new evacuation orders to Palestinians in areas of north\u00a0Gaza\u00a0that were among the first to be hit at the start of the war with Hamas in October, after militants fired a fresh volley of rockets into Israel. Army spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted the evacuation orders for several districts in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, two now largely demolished towns into which Israeli tanks swept at the outset of Israel\u2019s ground invasion. \u201cHamas and terrorist organizations are firing rockets from your area towards the State of Israel. The IDF will act forcefully and immediately against them,\u201d Adraee said in the message sent by text or social media to Palestinian residents. \u201cFor your own safety, evacuate immediately to the known shelters in the center of\u00a0Gaza\u00a0City,\u201d the army spokesman said. In a nearby\u00a0Gaza\u00a0City neighborhood, Al-Tuffah, an Israeli airstrike on a house killed three Palestinians, medics said. MULTIPLE FRONTS Fighting has continued in the\u00a0Gaza\u00a0Strip even as Israel braces for an expected assault in its north from Iran and its close Lebanese ally Hezbollah after the July 31 assassination in the Iranian capital Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. The Israeli military says it has killed dozens of\u00a0Gaza\u00a0militants in recent days and on Wednesday said troops had hit weapons-making facilities in the teeming district of Deir al-Balah in central\u00a0Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the fighting have taken shelter. In other central areas, Israeli tanks shelled Nuseirat and Bureij, two of\u00a0Gaza\u00a0Strip\u2019s eight historic refugee camps. Israel says Hamas militants use civilian infrastructure for cover and to conceal operations posts and arms caches; Hamas denies this. Militants say they continue to carry out ambush attacks on Israeli troops and armored vehicles with explosive devices, and are still able to launch limited rocket salvoes into Israel. On Tuesday, Islamic Jihad, a close Hamas ally, said it fired rockets into Israel in response to what it called Israeli \u201cmassacres of civilians\u201d. The Israeli military said that over the past week Hamas had fired rockets from launchers embedded near two international humanitarian aid and distribution warehouses, including the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israeli forces had struck those sites, it added. Hamas-led militants set off the\u00a0Gaza\u00a0war on Oct. 7 with a cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. In response, Israel has pursued a relentless assault on\u00a0Gaza\u00a0that has reduced much of the heavily populated coastal strip to ruins, killed at least 39,600 Palestinians and wounded over 91,500, according to\u00a0Gaza\u00a0health ministry figures. The Hamas-led ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.
