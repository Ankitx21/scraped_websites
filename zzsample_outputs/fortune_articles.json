        "body": "On Monday, Wall Street was ready to scour remarks from Jerome Powell for hints he might deliver a much-anticipated interest rate cut in September. The hint never came.  Today, the stock market is feeling the consequences. This week the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met to discuss the base interest rate, which currently sits at a more than two-decade high. While analysts were largely prepared to hear a cut of the rate\u2014currently targeted at 5.25% to 5.5%\u2014wouldn\u2019t come this month, they were waiting on a veiled nod that the committee\u2019s next meeting would bring such relief next month. Wall Street is hankering after a rate cut for a range of reasons, but the key concern is that if the Fed cuts rates too late \u2014\u00a0keeping the supply of money too tight for too long \u2014\u00a0it will stifle consumer spending and business capital expenditure, grinding the economy to a halt and leading to a rise in unemployment. On the flipside, lower rates would mean cheaper borrowing and higher levels of consumer consumption. But instead of Powell dropping hints about a Q3 cut, analysts got a \u201cbaby step,\u201d said Santander\u2019s chief U.S. economist, Stephen Stanley. \u201cChairman Powell emphasized in his press conference that recent data on inflation have \u2018added to\u2019 the Fed\u2019s confidence that inflation will return to the 2% target, but the Fed is not there yet,\u201d he wrote in a note seen by Fortune.  While the market had priced in a September cut, Stanley believes the news will come in November. \u201cI am skeptical that the key economic data over the next seven weeks are going to add to the FOMC\u2019s confidence,\u201d he wrote. Likewise, Bank of America\u2014even prior to the Fed\u2019s July meeting\u2014is not pricing in a rate cut until December. Yesterday credit strategist Yuri Seliger wrote in a note seen by Fortune that while Powell\u2019s comments \u201clargely agreed\u201d with a September cut, there is a key caveat: that timing is \u201cassuming no big surprises on inflation.\u201d A day prior, Seliger\u2019s colleagues\u2014U.S. economist Michael Gapen, rates strategist Mark Cabana, and FX strategist Alex Cohen\u2014wrote: \u201cIn our view, the main message from the July FOMC meeting is that the Fed is getting closer to a rate cut, but needs more evidence that inflation is under control before it does.\u00a0 \u201c[Powell] indicated that there was increased confidence within the committee that a September rate cut could happen, but data between now and then would have to validate the Fed\u2019s expectation. We think the Fed can be patient and wait for more evidence.\u201d The less emphatic evidence of a September cut is likely one of many reasons the global stock market took such a heavy hit over the last few hours. At the time of writing the S&P500 is down 1.4% over the past 24 hours, while the Nasdaq is down 2.3% over the same time period.  While some of this slump may be given a lackluster earnings call from Magnificent 7 stock Amazon, traders are also likely getting the creeping sense that the Fed may hang on too long. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions,\u201d Powell told reporters in a press conference following the FOMC meeting this week. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the data will reveal or how that will affect the appropriate path of our policy.\u201d While such a statement may have taken the wind out of other analysts\u2019 sails, Mike Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told Fortune he had a more balanced outlook. \u201cI am confident that the FOMC will cut rates in September,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true that Chair Powell and the rest of the FOMC are hedging their bets, but that is standard practice in this kind of situation. It would be highly unusual for them to explicitly commit to a rate cut a full meeting in advance.  \u201cWhen reading between the lines, the signals were there yesterday, and the recent data for both the labor market and inflation suggest that a rate cut will be warranted at the next meeting.\u201d The stock market\u2019s overnight tumble might look tame compared to the upset that could come in September if the cut doesn\u2019t materialize.  \u201cIt is hard to speculate on what the impact would be if the Fed did not cut rates in September because we do not have the economic data that will be released between now and then,\u201d Pugliese added. \u201cFor example, if the employment reports to be released on August 2 and September 6 are exceptionally strong and the next two CPI reports are also very \u2018hot,\u2019 then that would have different implications compared to a scenario where the economic data were generally weak between now and the Sept FOMC meeting but the Committee still chose not to cut rates.  \u201cBased on what we know now, no rate cut in September would come as a major surprise to us and to financial markets. Financial conditions likely would tighten if the FOMC adopted an unexpectedly hawkish stance over the next seven weeks.\u201d Over at UBS Brian\u00a0Rose, senior U.S. economist, is maintaining a milder stance on his previous statement that the market is pricing in \u201ca near-100% chance of a September cut.\u201d Yesterday in a note seen by Fortune, Rose added: \u201cOur view remains that the upcoming data will be soft enough for the Fed to start trimming rates by 25 basis points quarter, but not so bad that they would want to cut at a more aggressive pace. However, risks are asymmetric.\u201d"

        "body": "U.S. hiring decelerated sharply last month in the face of high interest rates as employers added a weak 114,000 jobs. Friday\u2019s Labor Department report showed a drop from the 179,000 jobs created in June. Forecasters had expected to see 175,000 jobs in July. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. The economy has proven unexpectedly sturdy in the face of the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign to tame inflation with high interest rates. The Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to a 23-year high. But the higher borrowing costs appear to be taking a toll. From January through June this year, the economy has generated a solid average of 222,000 new jobs a month, down from an average 251,000 last year, 377,000 in 2022 and a record 604,000 in 2021 when the economy bounded back from COVID-19 lockdowns. The economy is weighing heavily on voters\u2019 minds as they prepare for the presidential election in November. Many are unimpressed with the strong job gains of the past three years, exasperated instead by high prices. Two years ago, inflation hit a four-decade high. The price increases eased, but consumers are still paying 19% more for goods and services overall than they were before inflation first heated up in spring 2021. The June jobs report, though stronger than expected, came with blemishes. For one thing, Labor Department revisions reduced April and May payrolls by a combined 111,000. That meant that monthly job growth averaged just 177,000 from April through June, the lowest three-month average since January 2021. What\u2019s more, the unemployment rate has risen for the past three months. By surging in July\u2014jumping to 4.3%\u2014it has crossed a tripwire that historically has signaled an economy in recession. This is the so-called Sahm Rule, named for the former Fed economist who came up with it: Claudia Sahm. She found that a recession is almost always already underway if the unemployment rate (based on a three-month moving average) rises by half a percentage point from its low of the past year. It\u2019s been triggered in every U.S. recession since 1970. And it\u2019s had only two false positives since 1959; in both of those cases \u2014 in 1959 and 1969 \u2014 it was just premature, going off a few months before a downturn began. Still, Sahm, now chief economist at the investment firm New Century Advisors, said that this time \u201ca recession is not imminent\u201d even if unemployment crosses the Sahm Rule threshold. Many economists believe that today\u2019s rising unemployment rates reveal an influx of new workers into the American labor force who sometimes need time to find work, rather than a worrisome increase in job losses. \u201cLabor demand is slowing,\u2019\u2019 said Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, \u201cbut companies are not laying off workers in large numbers, which reduces the odds of a negative feedback loop of rising unemployment leading to income loss, reduction in spending, and more layoffs.\u2019\u2019 America\u2019s jobs numbers have been unsettled by an unexpected surge in immigration \u2014 much of it illegal \u2014 over the past couple of years. The new arrivals have poured into the American labor force and helped ease labor shortages across the economy \u2014 but not all of them have found jobs right away, pushing up the jobless rate. Moreover, people who have entered the country illegally are less inclined to respond to the Labor Department\u2019s jobs survey, meaning they can go uncounted as employed, notes Oxford\u2019s Martin. Nonetheless, Sahm remains concerned about the hiring slowdown, noting that a deteriorating job market can feed on itself. \u201cOnce you have a certain momentum going to the downside, it often can get going,\u201d Sahm said. The Sahm rule, she says, is \u201cnot working like it usually does, but it shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\u201d Sahm urged Fed policymakers to preemptively cut their benchmark interest rate at their meeting this week, but they chose to leave it unchanged at the highest level in 23 years. The Fed raised the rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to battle rising prices. Inflation has duly fallen \u2014 to 3% in June from 9.1% two years earlier. But it remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% target and policymakers want to see more evidence it\u2019s continuing to come down before they start cutting rates. Still, they are widely expected to make the first cut at their next meeting in September. Friday\u2019s job report could give them some encouraging news. According to FactSet, forecasters expect last month\u2019s average hourly wages to come in 3.7% above July 2023 levels. That would be the smallest gain since May 2021 and would mark progress toward the 3.5% that many economists see as consistent with the Fed\u2019s inflation goal."

        "body": "Who doesn\u2019t love a freebie?\u00a0 Even if it feels great to be offered something at no cost, staff at the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, can no longer accept them\u2014whether that\u2019s Olympic passes or concert tickets. The commission reportedly told its staff in an email that it would ban freebies as they raise \u201cquestions of compliance with the expected ethical behavior of members and staff, or can create reputational risks for the commission and the persons concerned,\u201d Politico reported on Wednesday.\u00a0 The rule is said to apply to large-scale events whose tickets are often hard to get hold of, such as the Eurovision Song Contest and the Olympics. There\u2019s no clear threshold for the value of gifts staffers can accept. Although commissioners can accept certain gifts as long as they\u2019re below \u20ac150 in value, they\u2019re encouraged to refuse them. One situation where the exception would apply is at sporting events if the staff member is representing the commission or the tickets are offered as a courtesy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe reputational risk of accepting a ticket is high when the general public has difficulties to obtain tickets,\u201d the email said. The general guidance for staff is that \u201ca simple offer of tickets constitutes a gift that should generally be refused,\u201d a spokesperson for the European Commission told Fortune. If the staffer must accept the gift for diplomatic or other reasons, they must seek permission.  \u201cCommissioners shall not seek or accept gifts unless there is a due justification,\u201d the spokesperson said.  The new rules have emerged in light of scandals involving commission members on similar accounts. For instance, Henrik Hololei, who served in the transport department, took free flights during a major deal negotiation last year. The commission has a pattern of accepting trips paid for by third parties either in part or fully, Politico found. Last June, the European Commission proposed adopting a standardized approach for all EU bodies on accepting gifts, hospitality and travel arrangements from third parties.\u00a0 High-profile political figures are generally scrutinized for such actions because of ethical conflicts. Such actions could create a quid-pro-quo relationship, giving politicians more power to influence business. There are numerous examples even outside the European Union.\u00a0 For instance, last month, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer reportedly accepted \u00a376,000 worth of event tickets, clothes, and other freebies from donors following the 2019 general elections, the Financial Times reported. These charges are typically meant to be disclosed to the U.K.\u2019s House of Commons register of interest, excluding international travel.\u00a0 Starmer defended his decision to accept free tickets for football games, saying it was a security concern to have him seated in the stands.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

        "body": "The good news about donanemab, Eli Lilly\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s drug, reached CEO Dave Ricks on July\u00a02 as he was hiking in a remote part of Colorado.\u00a0 The pharmaceutical company had slogged for 35 years and spent $8\u00a0billion to develop an effective treatment for the terrible memory-robbing disease. So when much-longed-for news of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the medicine finally arrived\u2014in the middle of the Indianapolis pharmaceutical company\u2019s annual shutdown week, with the CEO and most of his 20,000 U.S. employees on holiday\u2014Ricks dialed into FaceTime for a quick impromptu celebration.\u00a0 Two of his top science deputies toasted the achievement with their boss, raising glasses of Champagne as Ricks took a swig from his bottle of water. The monoclonal antibody soon to be branded as Kisunla and prescribed at a cost of $32,000 a year is not a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014it is meant to slow the early progression of the disease. Still, Ricks says, its approval is a sign that Lilly\u2019s processes are working.\u00a0 \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a lesson in determination,\u201d the 57-year-old CEO tells me, back from vacation a week later. \u201cMany times we could have given up, and we didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 Indeed, just over a decade ago there were serious concerns about the future of the 148-year-old company. But there is plenty to celebrate lately at Eli Lilly.\u00a0 The company is now the ninth most valuable in the world thanks to record-breaking sales\u2014$34.1\u00a0billion in 2023, up 20% over the previous year\u2014and its growing stable of innovative new medicines for conditions as diverse as cancer and ulcerative colitis. Earlier this year, Lilly\u2019s experimental gene therapy successfully cured a child of deafness. This summer, Lilly is a sponsor of Team USA at the Olympics, and you\u2019ll see the red cursive Lilly logo on the jerseys of WNBA team the Indiana Fever (including its rookie superstar Caitlin Clark). $791 billion But the big story for Lilly, the main reason for its stratospheric $791\u00a0billion market cap\u2014which makes it more valuable than Tesla, Exxon Mobil, and its fiercest pharma rival, Novo Nordisk, by the way\u2014is the absolute mania (the Lilly-palooza?) that surrounds the company\u2019s weight loss drug, tirzepatide.\u00a0 Even before it hit the market as the diabetes medication Mounjaro, in May 2022, tirzepatide had been declared the \u201cKing Kong of GLP-1s\u201d\u2014poised to crush the market\u2019s \u201cgorilla,\u201d semaglutide, which Novo markets as Ozempic and Wegovy. (GLP-1 drugs mimic hormones that regulate appetite. Tirzepatide is a leveling up of the category, mimicking two hormones.) It was a foregone conclusion that when Lilly released the drug as a $13,000-a-year obesity medicine, Zepbound, it would be a blockbuster.\u00a0 But the scale of the excitement has exceeded even Lilly\u2019s wildest projections. The drug\u2019s limited side effects and incredible efficacy\u2014on average, patients lose 18% of their body weight, even more than those on Ozempic, studies show\u2014have made Zepbound a favorite of celebrities and TikTok-famous in its own right.\u00a0 Together, Mounjaro and Zepbound have raked in $7.3\u00a0billion in sales, and that total would be even greater had Lilly been able to meet patient demand: Both forms of tirzepatide, which are weekly injectables intended for long-term use, were placed on the FDA\u2019s national shortage list within months of Zepbound\u2019s debut, and certain dosages remain there. It\u2019s hard to overstate the impact of this new class of medications, which are quickly blowing up America\u2019s $90\u00a0billion diet industry. They have upended long-held assumptions about weight loss drugs: that they don\u2019t work and that insurance (where the money lies for drugmakers) won\u2019t cover them.\u00a0 Not only do these drugs work, emerging evidence suggests that they effectively treat a host of related health issues, from obstructive sleep apnea to the liver disease MASH. They also seem to lower risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack. Few would have expected Lilly to reach such lofty heights even a decade ago, when the company was navigating some of the most difficult years of\u00a0its existence.\u00a0 Eli Lilly has a long, proud history that begins in 1876 when its eponymous founder\u2014a Civil War Union Army colonel turned chemist\u2014opened a two-story laboratory in Indianapolis. In that era of dubious tinctures and snake oil, Lilly specialized in quality control and later staked its name on it, promoting the slogan, \u201cIf it bears a red Lilly, it must be right.\u201d\u00a0 Over the past century, the company\u2019s major products have included the first U.S. commercial insulin, polio vaccines, penicillin, and the blockbuster antidepressant Prozac.\u00a0 But pharma is a business of booms and busts. Ricks, who joined Lilly 28 years ago and rose through the ranks to become CEO, has been around long enough to experience both.\u00a0 He joined the company several years before \u201cYear\u00a0X\u201d\u2014the much-dreaded date that Prozac, a drug that accounted for a quarter of the company\u2019s revenue and a third of its profits, lost patent exclusivity, allowing other companies to manufacture it. Not even a decade later came \u201cYears\u00a0YZ,\u201d the even more dire period in which four Lilly drugs, accounting for half the company\u2019s sales, went generic. Worse, the cupboard was bare: Lilly had gone years without launching a new drug. \u201cThere was a legitimate question,\u201d Ricks remembers: \u201cIs this actually a running concern?\u201d\u00a0 In 2009 the company\u2019s then-CEO John Lechleiter and his leadership team made a surprising decision in an effort to save Lilly. Rather than turning to one of the industry-favored shortcuts\u2014large-scale M&A or selling a business unit\u2014Lilly went to investors with a plan to double down on its own research and development.\u00a0 \u201cWe basically said, \u2018Our path is R&D\u2009\u2026\u2009We\u2019re going to rebase the company. We\u2019re going to stop growing earnings; we\u2019re going to shrink them,\u2019\u2009\u201d Ricks recalls. \u201c\u2009\u2018And we want you to stick with us and ride it out.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u00a0 The Street wasn\u2019t convinced: \u201cThe stock traded at $28,\u201d Ricks notes. \u201cThat\u2019s humbling.\u201d (It now trades at $832.)\u00a0 This may have been the company\u2019s nadir, but hard times lay ahead. Lilly\u2019s scientists were known to be rigorous, but they were among the slowest in the industry, averaging 11 years to go from clinic to market. (Data from the time suggests the industry averaged eight years.) And too often, rather than good results, they got expensive late-stage failures. The pipeline coughed out five in a row at one point, and multiple misses in Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cIt was bad,\u201d says Ricks. At the time, a period in which most of Lilly\u2019s competitors were capitalizing on the industry\u2019s immuno-oncology boom, Lilly looked as if it had missed the boat. But Ricks and Dan Skovronsky, the company\u2019s chief scientific officer, say their focus, and even the failures, provided lessons that paved the way to this year\u2019s successes.\u00a0 \u201cWe weren\u2019t loved by Wall Street. And, you know, we got complaints,\u201d remembers Skovronsky: \u201cWhy do you work on things that are so hard? Can\u2019t you jump on the bandwagon where everyone else is?\u201d\u00a0 But over time, Lilly\u2019s work on less Street-pleasing pursuits, like diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s, began to bear fruit. Months before he became CEO in 2017, Ricks received a call from Skovronsky, who told him about a small study in Singapore involving an experimental compound to treat diabetes: 12 participants had to drop out because they had lost so much weight that they needed to eat. It was odd, but the two men sensed a promising signal: \u201cThis is going to be something special,\u201d Skovronsky told him. That drug was tirzepatide.\u00a0 At this crossroads, one might view Lilly\u2019s turnaround story like the fable of the tortoise and the hare, with Lilly\u2019s plodding, persistent work on the science ultimately beating out its less focused competitors (many of which are now scrambling to get into the obesity race).\u00a0 \u201cStaying on track turns out to be a pretty important thing,\u201d Ricks tells me, with a hint of vindication. In retrospect, he says of the company\u2019s dark days, \u201cwe were in deep trouble\u2014financially, we had a lot of problems\u2014but actually our strategy was right.\u201d The key was patience, Skovronsky explains. \u201cLilly as a company can focus on hard problems for a long period of time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about resources, but also perseverance.\u201d Tirzepatide also represents a turning point for Lilly\u2014from a company that moved too slowly to one that learned how to move fast. It took the company just six years to get tirzepatide from clinic to market\u2014a profound transformation from the Lilly of 11-year development cycles. Key to the whole R&D evolution was rewiring the way Lilly\u2019s scientists thought. Ricks focused his organization on speed and science, with the goal of ridding the development process of inefficiencies, and of the biases that could lead to late-stage failure and waste.\u00a0 The first goal\u2014to become the fastest to market in the industry\u2014was audacious, but arguably simpler. Skovronsky led the effort to map and streamline the 800 steps of the drug development process, prioritizing saving time over saving money.\u00a0 The latter goal, of getting a scientific organization to make purely scientific decisions, sounds easy but requires overcoming people\u2019s natural biases toward particular ideas, projects, or teams. The answer, says Ricks, is more thoughtfully designing studies to produce the critical data necessary to drive decisions.\u00a0 Key, Skovronsky says, was giving scientists \u201cpermission to fail,\u201d a freeing mindset that encouraged big, creative thinking about how to get around the usual development bottlenecks. For example, rather than wait the many months it took to enroll patients in clinical trials at hospital sites, Lilly outfitted some recreational vehicles as mobile labs and went directly to communities to recruit trial participants. By 2020\u2019s pandemic, Lilly had proved it was no tortoise: It was the first company to develop a COVID antibody therapy, which it did in eight months. \u201cThat record is never going to be broken,\u201d says Ricks. Analysts and other observers now marvel at the company\u2019s evolution. \u201cIt\u2019s just been sort of remarkable, the amount of innovation at Lilly,\u201d says Damien Conover, director of health care equity research at Morningstar. \u201cThey were average players for a long time,\u201d says Mike Rea, CEO of IDEA Pharma, a consultancy that tracks innovation in the industry. \u201cNow [Lilly is] thinking about playing the game differently, as well as just playing the same game better than other people.\u201d Ricks gives off the casual, cheerful vibe of a Midwestern dad (which he is). He often doesn\u2019t wear a tie\u2014a choice, he notes, that distinguishes him from his 10 predecessors. (He recalls the formality he first encountered at Lilly, and shocking colleagues early in his career by greeting the company\u2019s CEO in the elevator.)\u00a0 Increasingly, Ricks told me, he thinks of patients as Lilly\u2019s primary customers. That might seem like a given, but it\u2019s actually a change in his business, where, for many years, companies like Lilly focused foremost on the physicians who prescribed their products, and then, in more recent times, the payers (insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs) with whom they negotiated prices and coverage terms.\u00a0 \u201cHealth care is a mess for consumers,\u201d says Ricks, who adds that he wants to give people who take Lilly\u2019s medications an Apple Store\u2013like experience: \u201cThat\u2019s so far from what we have now. We have a lot to aspire to in being a great consumer company.\u201d\u00a0 Doing that will require disruption of the status quo, and Lilly is making some moves. In early 2023, it soft-launched LillyDirect, an online pharmacy platform to distribute its insulin products to customers. The project proved logistically challenging, given cold-chain needs and state-by-state pharmacy licensing and regulatory requirements, but by early this year it was ready to offer (at its half-off coupon rate) Zepbound, Mounjaro, and Lilly\u2019s migraine medicine too. LillyDirect also connects patients to health care providers and other resources.\u00a0 Reddit forums suggest the platform, which is supported by Amazon\u2019s and Truepill\u2019s online pharmacies, has been inundated and that customer feedback is mixed (skewing poor).\u00a0 Ricks acknowledges there\u2019s plenty to improve on, but says he considers the experiment so far to be \u201chugely successful.\u201d\u00a0 Yet all the innovation\u00a0in the world can\u2019t solve\u00a0Lilly\u2019s most pressing\u00a0challenge: supply.\u00a0 In March, Dave Knapp, a marketing professional and father of four from Cedar Falls, Iowa, put out a plea to Eli Lilly on TikTok: \u201cRelease the Vials!\u201d\u00a0 Knapp has taken Mounjaro for his Type\u00a02 diabetes since 2022, and, like many others, he has struggled to fill his prescription at times. Though Lilly says it\u2019s producing more medicine than ever before, it simply doesn\u2019t have the manufacturing capacity to meet the current massive demand. Lilly is furiously building more factories to produce its drugs\u2014an investment of $18\u00a0billion since 2020. But construction of such highly regulated manufacturing facilities typically takes three to four years.\u00a0 The shortage is a frequent topic of Knapp\u2019s blog, On the Pen, which he started as a resource for fellow patients, and which has grown into an online community of tens of thousands.\u00a0 \u201cWe were in deep trouble\u2014financially, we had a lot of problems\u2014but actually our strategy was right.\u201d The stories of so many desperate people\u2014driving for hours and calling hundreds of pharmacies to find medicine; puzzling over how to adjust their drug regimens when they couldn\u2019t find their meds\u2014irked him. Why wasn\u2019t Lilly better managing the issue?\u00a0 Knapp understood the complexity of Lilly\u2019s task: Tirzepatide is branded as two different drugs, each of which comes in six different dosages. The drug is distributed in single-dose injector pens, which are convenient for patients but complex to manufacture. But he also knew Lilly had FDA approval to distribute the drug in simple single-dose vials. That requires patients to draw up the solution in a syringe themselves, but Lilly does distribute the drug this way in some foreign markets. It seemed to him that it should be easier to manufacture. Given that patients were struggling to get their prescribed medication, Knapp thought, why not release the vials to Americans too? \u201cThey\u2019ve had this sort of rip\u00a0cord all along,\u201d he tells me. Despite being\u00a0an issue deep in the weeds of the pharmaceutical supply chain, Knapp\u2019s\u00a0call to #ReleasetheVials went viral. It got Ricks\u2019s attention, and he tells me he welcomes the engagement: \u201cConsumers are getting smarter about how the industry works, and I think that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s really unheard-of in our sector, historically, that patients are sort of self-organizing online to lobby companies to make more. That\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Still, Lilly hasn\u2019t released the vials. \u201cWe\u2019re open to every solution to address supply, including that one,\u201d Ricks tells me in July. He expresses regret that patients are struggling to get medicines. \u201cIt\u2019s the top priority for me and the company,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s capital intensive, technically challenging, logistically difficult, and highly regulated, so we have a lot to work through.\u201d The day I visit, Ricks is bound for Pleasant Prairie, Wis., the site of a sterile manufacturing facility that Lilly recently acquired to boost production of its tirzepatide medications. And 30 miles north of Lilly\u2019s headquarters, construction workers are laying concrete and erecting steel beams in the middle of an Indiana cornfield, providing the first glimpses of what a dust-covered billboard announces as \u201cthe future manufacturing site of Mounjaro and Zepbound.\u201d Lilly hopes it will be operational by 2026. Of course, Lilly isn\u2019t waiting on this earthly slog. It\u2019s racing ahead with its next-generation obesity drugs that many expect to unseat Zepbound. The most hyped include a triple-acting agent that promises even greater weight loss and a GLP-1 in pill form. It\u2019s also moving urgently to launch its new Alzheimer\u2019s drug, Kisunla. And it\u2019s pouring billions more into R&D this year.\u00a0 At this moment of unprecedented success, Ricks has a new anxiety. \u201cA lot of companies become mediocre as they grow,\u201d he tells me. The goal now is to keep rising \u201cabove the regular.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s our purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cTo do important things at scale.\u201d\u2002 This article appears in the August/September issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cThe Lilly-palooza.\u201d"

        "body": "Many tech firms have spent the last two years summoning workers back into the office\u2014all the while threatening them with layoffs. Even Zoom reverted to in-person working last year. But now, it looks like tech bosses have given up their war on working from home.\u00a0 Just 3% of tech firms are now asking their workers to go into the office full-time\u2014a significant drop from 8% last year. Flex Index analyzed the flexible work policies for 2,670 tech companies that collectively employ over 11 million people\u2014and it found that tech firms have conceded that flexible working is here to stay. In fact, 79% of the tech firms surveyed are fully flexible, up from 75% in 2023.\u00a0 Meanwhile, more and more firms are giving employees the choice of when and where they work. While 38% of tech firms had an \u201cemployee\u2019s choice\u201d model in 2023, today that percentage has jumped to 56%. It\u2019s now the most popular policy among tech firms. In comparison, just 18% of firms are dictating which days their workers need to work from the office with a \u201cstructure hybrid model\u201d. Tech companies are perhaps the most well-positioned to work from home\u2014and, in some cases, have even created the tools to do so. It\u2019s why in 2020, the likes of Meta, Twitter (now X), Shopify, and more declared that they were going to leverage the new decentralized way of working for good.\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale, with a thoughtful and responsible plan for how to do this,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg boasted, while claiming that half of Meta\u2019s employees would be working remotely within the next five to 10 years.\u00a0 That was until last year, when Zuckerberg declared that 2023 was going to be the \u201cYear of Efficiency\u201d and demanded workers return to work in the name of productivity, while simultaneously scaring staff into complying with mass layoffs. Meanwhile, just two years after declaring that 60% of its workforce would operate remotely, Dell has now told workers that they must go into the office three days a week if they want any hope of a promotion. Google, Salesforce and Amazon are also among major tech companies that are cracking down on return-to-office policies\u2014and meeting resistance from workers. It\u2019s not just in the tech world that defeated CEOs have given up on forcing their workers to return to their vertical towers. Separate research echoes that CEOs across the board have softened their stance on working from home.\u00a0 KPMG surveyed U.S. CEOs of companies turning over at least $500 million and found that just one-third expect a full return to the office in the next three years. It\u2019s a complete 360 from their stance last year, when 62% of CEOs surveyed predicted that working from home would end by 2026. Why the change of heart? It\u2019s no secret that rigid in-office policies haven\u2019t landed well with workers. Leaders are perhaps experiencing more resistance than they had anticipated. Amazon is perhaps the most documented example of how ugly the RTO battle can get: Around 30,000 employees signed a petition protesting the company\u2019s in-office mandate, and more than 1,800 pledged to walk out from their jobs to take a stand.\u00a0 The tech giant is still complaining that workers are dodging the three-day in-office mandate, over a year after it was announced. Dropbox cofounder and CEO Drew Houston perfectly summed up the situation with bosses struggling over RTO: \u201cThey keep hitting the go-back-to-2019 button, and it\u2019s clear it\u2019s not working.\u201d"

        "body": "Elon Musk could be on the hook for $35 million in damages, after Don Lemon sued the owner of social media platform X over fraud and breach of contract. The entrepreneur had lured the former CNN newsman to X/Twitter with the promise of a much bigger audience only to cancel in March the exclusive partnership\u00a0at the last minute\u00a0following a tense interview, during which Musk palpably bristled at Lemon\u2019s questions. Now Lemon believes he is entitled to punitive damages, arguing that Musk\u2019s actions rose above and beyond simple negligence and misconduct to meet the legal bar of oppression, malice and fraud set forth under California\u2019s Civil Code\u00a0section 3294, at the time still home to X\u2019s\u00a0corporate headquarters. His lawsuit claims Musk\u2019s company had first used the 2005 Edward R. Murrow journalism award recipient to launder its sullied reputation among corporate ad buyers before discarding him after Lemon served their purpose, never once paying him a dime. \u201cDefendants sought to affiliate with reputable figures whose name, likeness, identity and reputation they could use to piggyback off of to retain advertisers,\u201d the lawsuit states. This became critical in November, after Musk\u00a0went out of his way\u00a0to alienate Disney and numerous other companies that feared the platform was\u00a0no longer safe for their brands. Executives including X CEO Linda Yaccarino and Brett Weitz, her head of content, talent and brand sales\u2014both of whom were named as additional defendants\u2014were then desperate to line up exclusive partnerships with established personalities turn the ship around, the suit claims. \u201cLemon was a top prospect. A gay, Black man with an excellent reputation and a household name, he was the perfect candidate to partner with to aid their dying advertisement revenue,\u201d the lawsuit stated. Don Lemon show coming to \ud835\udd4f! https://t.co/Y906YecnTw In early January, he claimed he was forced to announce the new partnership at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas or suffer the penalty of the one-year offer, worth a guaranteed minimum of $1.5 million, being withdrawn. The interview two months later that ended it all delved into issues deeply uncomfortable to Musk, including allegations of hate speech proliferation on the platform, the tycoon\u2019s own strident political views as well as his use of prescription ketamine to combat mood swings and depressions.\u00a0 At one point Musk replied icily \u201cDon, the only reason I\u2019m doing this interview is because you\u2019re on the X platform.\u201d He later recommended the former CNN journalist choose his next questions carefully.\u00a0 Immediately following, Lemon was informed by X that their deal was off and his services were no longer required. Weitz told him he would receive no compensation for the ensuing expenses since no written contract had ever been signed. Elon Musk canceled #TheDonLemonShow\ud83d\udc40Watch on YouTube and listen everywhere on Monday March 18. pic.twitter.com/AAhnvcY0ny Musk then went on to snap that Lemon was a \u201cstupid asshole\u201d whose idea for a center-left cable news program in the style of CNN was bound to flop on an alternative media platform like X. \u201cHe is beyond entitled and his show is unwatchable,\u201d added Musk, who had promoted it only weeks earlier. The loss of the deal and the subsequent attacks diminished his standing in the media community, Lemon claims. \u201cAs a proximate result of Defendants\u2019 actions, Lemon has suffered and continues to suffer emotional distress and mental pain and anguish,\u201d the lawsuit says. Lemon\u2019s allegations that Musk and Yaccarino piggy-backed off his reputation can however apply equally to the former CNN newsman.\u00a0 On a chart that measured personality and intelligence, \ud83c\udf4b would be in the worst quadrant \u2013 stupid asshole Once a prominent and regular face on cable television, Lemon\u2019s star power has waned following his termination from the network last year. The promotional support from someone as popular and influential as Musk certainly helped put him back in the spotlight for a period.\u00a0 Whereas the Musk interview helped Lemon garner 2 million views on YouTube, most of his other videos have since struggled to even breach the 100,000 mark. One 23-minute long interview that aired in early May couldn\u2019t even interest 2,500 viewers.\u00a0\u00a0 And while other former news figures like Carlson and Megyn Kelly have managed to rescue their brands by proving popular on Spotify, Lemon\u2019s podcast doesn\u2019t rank even among the top 100 in the U.S., the only major market where he\u2019s well known. The lawsuit is seeking restitution of all profits, gains and other financial benefits that Musk, Yaccarino and Co. wrongfully obtained at his expense, in addition to punitive rewards.\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a genius to see the fraud, negligence and reputational damage here,\u201d Lemon\u2019s lawyer Carney Shegerian\u00a0told\u00a0the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0on Thursday. Fortune\u00a0has reached out to Musk, Yaccarino, Weitz and Lemon for further comment.\u00a0"

        "publish_date": "2024-08-02",
        "author": "Jennifer Birdsall",
        "body": "On July 27, 2021 Simone Biles, the world\u2019s greatest gymnast, withdrew from the Tokyo Olympics to prioritize her mental health. The move sent shockwaves through the gymnastics community and elite athletics everywhere. How could, and why would, the greatest drop out? Despite controversy and naysayers online, many applauded her bravery and willingness to put her own well-being first. Following the Tokyo Games, Biles took time away from the sport\u2014focusing on herself and other aspects of her life, including therapy, business endeavors, and getting married. Fast forward almost exactly three years, and Biles is once again an Olympic champion, leading the U.S. women\u2019s gymnastics team to a gold medal in Paris on Tuesday before securing the gold in the All-Around competition on Thursday, with even more opportunities for medals on the horizon. Biles deserves all the praise she has received\u2014not only for her incredible athleticism and grace under pressure but also for her perseverance and unwavering faith in herself.\u00a0 What I\u2019d like to also applaud her for, however, is how she has\u2014perhaps unintentionally\u2014destigmatized mental health leaves of absence for millions of people around the world, especially American women. Data from my company, ComPsych\u2014which administers leave of absence and accommodations for more than 6 million people\u2014shows there\u2019s been a staggering 300% increase in mental health-related leaves from 2017 to 2023. This trend has been driven primarily by female workers. In fact, new data for the first quarter of 2024 shows that women accounted for 71% of these leaves. A mental health leave of absence is time a person takes away from work to address a mental health condition such as depression or anxiety. The duration may be quite short (a matter of days) or more lengthy (weeks or even months) depending on the condition the person is struggling with and the course of treatment recommended by their healthcare provider. Mental Health leaves can be protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which has been around for decades. Most people are familiar with taking leave for their physical medical conditions or caring for a family member; however, there has historically been a lower usage of protected leaves for mental health. This likely is related to the stigma and fear around asking for support. A 2020 study from Aetna International found that more than half (52%) of employees with a diagnosed mental health issue admitted to lying to their employer about their reasons for taking a sick day. The same study also found people were twice as likely to take time off for a physical health issue than a mental health problem (66% versus 34% respectively). There is clearly a shift happening in the absence space, as well as a crisis among American women, many of whom are a part of the \u201csandwich generation\u201d caring for older loved ones as well as children while trying to manage the demands of their career. I suspect these women are stretching themselves so thin that they reach burnout\u2014just as Biles did in Tokyo. There is a silver lining. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a reduction in mental health stigma. We haven\u2019t eliminated stigma, unfortunately, and it remains a barrier to care; but with this shift in the right direction, more and more people are willing to share their own stories and personal struggles with mental health. It appears they are also more willing to take the leaves they need to prioritize treatment. Simone Biles is a wonderful example of this, as she became an inspiration for many, helping move the needle and making it more comfortable and safer for others to reach out for support as well. This data tells us we have an imperative as individuals, as organizations, and as a society to do more to support women and help them better prioritize self-care and work-life balance. In doing so, we would ideally prevent the need for a mental health leave in the first place.  Of course, this change won\u2019t happen overnight. Generations of women have internalized the message that they have to push through difficult times and sacrifice their own well-being in order to put others first or to achieve their goals\u2014whether that be a promotion at work or a gold medal. That\u2019s why Biles\u2019s example is so powerful. A huge part of the stigma for these leaves is the \u201cWhat will everyone think of me?\u201d and \u201cWill I be treated differently?\u201d questions. What Biles showed in Tokyo was that she was brave enough to put herself first\u2014work on her well-being and self-care, with the goal of coming back stronger and healthier. While that didn\u2019t need to be a return to the Olympics, she did just that. In Paris, she proved she was able to return to the sport she loves as the same top performer her peers have always known.  I hope people everywhere are inspired by this story. I know I am. While we need to keep stigma-busting and encouraging mental health care into our daily routines to prevent burnout and leaves, I also hope women out there realize they are capable of leaving and coming back stronger.

        "body": "For some Chinese shoppers, the 16,700 yuan, or $2,300, price tag of a Louis Vuitton Speedy Bandouliere 20 handbag is too much. It\u2019s one reason why more and more are traveling to Japan\u2014where the price for the same bag can be more than $400 lower.\u00a0\u00a0 Tourists, many of them from China, can thank the weak Japanese yen for the built-in discounts on luxury goods\u2014which are driving surges of visitors to the country for the primary purpose of shopping. Over 3 million visitors flocked to Japan in May, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization, and 1.3 million Chinese mainlanders visited in the first quarter of this year\u2014a year-over-year increase of more than 800%. The influx coincides with the yen slipping to a 34-year low in April. Despite Japan\u2019s efforts to hike interest rates, its currency still languishes behind the U.S. dollar, effectively discounting many goods for those willing to make the trip. A TAG Heuer watch in New York selling for $6,450 in New York can be found for closer to $5,000 in Tokyo\u2014including the 10% duty-free discount for American travelers.\u00a0 As a result, many visitors coming to Japan are putting shopping sprees at the top of their itineraries.\u00a0 \u201cShopping, shopping, shopping,\u201d one tourist from Indonesia told Reuters. \u201cHigh-end brands are cheap here. We are going to buy Dior but we are going to Chanel first.\u201d Japan\u2019s retail sales grew 3% in May from the year before, according to government data, compared to the expected 2%. Its luxury market is worth $41.1 billion, according to consumer trend platform Euromonitor, and is forecasted to reach $42.3 billion in two years. Despite a global luxury slowdown, companies like LVMH have seen massive growth in their Japanese markets. Japan was the fastest-growing country for the luxury conglomerate\u2019s 75 brands, which include Louis Vuitton and Dior. LVMH sales in Japan grew 31% across the first nine months of 2023. Stores from brands Celine, Dior, Cartier, and Herm\u00e8s have cropped up in massive Tokyo shopping developments just this year. But despite the rapid growth of the Japanese market, luxury brands have mixed feelings about the prospect of shoppers on the hunt for good deals. LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony warned that Japan\u2019s appealing shopping climate has disincentivized Asian customers from buying luxury goods in their home countries, as many of them instead wait for their impending trip to Japan to spend big. It means more traffic\u2014but crunched profits. \u201cWe are happy with the growth generated in Japan, but it comes at a notable cost from a profit and margin perspective,\u201d Guiony said during the company\u2019s earnings call last month.\u00a0 Business in China \u201cis slightly down because the business is taking place elsewhere and particularly in Japan. In Japan, traffic is going through the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation in Japan\u2026is not something we had factored in and forecasted, to be frank,\u201d he added, describing the business shift from Asia to Japan as \u201cextremely violent.\u201d  A spokesperson for LVMH declined to comment beyond the CFO\u2019s statements.  French spirits company Remy Cointreau experienced a similar conundrum. While its sales across Asia were down this quarter, sales in Japan were strong and \u201cboosted by tourism and partially also the weak yen,\u201d CFO Luca Marotta said last week, though he admitted Japan\u2019s growth came at the expense of other parts of the continent. Sales in \u201cHong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau were particularly weak, impacted by\u2026tourist preference for Japan over Hong Kong,\u201d he said in the company\u2019s July 24 earnings call. The company did not respond to Fortune\u2018s request for further comment. Luxury companies are in a precarious position. It\u2019s difficult for brands to increase prices on products because the yen is so volatile. Consumer sensitivity to major price hikes in recent years has dissuaded companies from raising costs even more. Meanwhile, Japanese retailers continue to welcome tourists, particularly Chinese visitors, with open arms, Tokyo-based brand strategist England Summers told Women\u2019s Wear Daily. Retailers are hiring more workers who speak Chinese and using Chinese social media to build connections with their budding audience. And because of Japan\u2019s strict border control policies, its luxury goods are near-guaranteed to be authentic. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm for travel retail in Japan,\u201d Summers said."

        "body": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic o\u00ad\u00adf 2020, most countries have witnessed a rapid runup in inflation followed by hasty retreat. For some nations, the trip\u2019s been a wild rollercoaster ride, a lurching ascent towards a summit where the houses below look like Monopoly pieces, followed by a steep, head-spinning drop. For others, the journey has resembled a snowmobile\u2019s wintry climb up a low, sloping hill, and the gliding descent down the other side. Only the general, up-and-down pattern is the same. But some nations never experienced a steep inflation jump at all. Put simply, \u201cBig Inflation\u201d wasn\u2019t a global phenomenon. Our research into the link between money supply and inflation in 27 countries since 2020 shows that where the roller-coaster scourge happened, as in the U.S., the cause was a huge, misguided spike in the money supply. In countries where M2 (a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and other deposits readily convertible to cash) rose only gradually, the price rise proved moderate and didn\u2019t require draconian, potentially growth-crushing measures to correct. While the inflation rides have varied a great deal across geographies, the refrains about their sources have not. Officialdom and the chattering classes have all sung the same song: Inflation was caused by a plethora of non-monetary factors, ranging from supply chain glitches to COVID-19 lockdowns to oil price spikes. Once these factors receded, so did inflation. Absent from the standard script is the role of money. For example, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), in its recent Annual Economic Report, highlights five lessons learned from the post-COVID waves of inflation. But nowhere to be found is the role money supply played. Such a reaction by central bankers is typical. After all, no one likes to take the blame for causing inflation. For central bankers, it\u2019s the old adage: It\u2019s not me, it\u2019s the guy behind the tree. Academic cover for the central bankers\u2019 version is provided by the current fashion in macroeconomics. Money is absent from the post-Keynesian models that have been en vogue for the past 30 years. That wasn\u2019t always the case. Back in 1985, when Gottfried Haberler penned his influential The Problem of Stagflation, he wrote: \u201cI fully agree with the monetarists that inflation, including stagflation, is basically a monetary phenomenon, in the sense that there has never been a significant inflation or stagflation\u2014prices rising, say, by 4 percent or more a year for two or more years\u2014without a significant growth in the stock of money.\u201d What Haberler wrote in 1985 is as true today as it was then. We examined the link between changes in the stock of broad money and inflation in 27 countries during the 2020-24 period. These countries account for over 75% of the world\u2019s GDP. They range from large developed to smaller emerging market nations. To compare money supply and inflation data, we used a 12-month moving average of the year-over-year percentage changes. We found a very clear pattern in all cases. First, the rate of growth in the money supply changed. Then, with a lag, inflation changed its course. The amplitude of the inflationary ramp varied from wild to mild. The wild upward swings happened in the U.S., U.K., Eurozone, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Ghana, Israel, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Turkey. The up-and-down ride was mild in China, Japan, Switzerland, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and South Africa. The two largest economies in the world, the U.S. and China, illustrate that inflation isn\u2019t universal but rather dependent on the rate of growth in each country\u2019s money supply. In the U.S., we find that the rate of growth in the money supply soared after COVID-19 hit, peaking in April 2021 at a pace over four times more rapid than pre-COVID. Nineteen months later, the U.S. inflation rate peaked at 8.1% and was also over four times higher than its pre-COVID rate. That\u2019s a theme park-level, rollercoaster liftoff skyward that leaves the whole family breathless. In contrast, China didn\u2019t experience much of an upward ride at all. Its money supply growth rate didn\u2019t change much after the pandemic hit, reaching its peak in February 2021. With a 24-month lag, China\u2019s annual inflation rate peaked at only 2.1%. The recent ups and downs in inflation echo Milton Friedman\u2019s dictum: \u201cInflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\u201d They also mirror Friedman\u2019s findings on the lag of roughly two years between changes in the stock of money and changes in inflation. In the 27 countries we studied, the mean and median lags witnessed in the 2020-24 inflation rollercoaster were 23.9 and 23 months, respectively. Having failed to predict the recent ups and downs in the course of inflation, central bankers and contemporary macroeconomists should throw away their scripts and models and start paying attention to the strong causal link between changes in the stock of money and inflation.

        "body": "It used to be that everyone wanted a career in tech. Not any more. For Gen Z, traditional jobs in\u00a0teaching\u00a0and\u00a0healthcare\u00a0are hot. But beware of romanticizing the subsidized meals, steady income, and generous annual vacation time. In reality, the industries are a hotbed for burnout. New research from Vision Direct has revealed that over a third of Brits have cried at work at least once in the past year, with 55% of them citing stress as the trigger. Some jobs are more tear-inducing than others: teachers are most likely to break down at work because they\u2019re burned out, followed by healthcare professionals.\u00a0 In the survey of 2,000 employees, 27% held burnout responsible for bursting into tears, while 15% said the work itself was enough to make them cry. Women were three times more likely to tear up due to burnout than men. Meanwhile, Gen Z was found to be the most likely age group to get weepy in the workplace, with 34% of respondents admitting they\u2019d done so; a stark contrast to the 7% of Boomers who did. 1. Education\u00a0\u00a02. Health care and social assistance\u00a03. Finance and insurance\u00a04. Government and public services\u00a05. Hotel and food services\u00a0 While Gen Zers aspiring for a job in finance may anticipate occasionally crying on the job\u2014after all, it\u2019s famous for its always-on, dog-eat-dog culture\u2014those looking for work-life balance in teaching may be unpleasantly surprised. Although Vision Direct\u2019s research didn\u2019t highlight why teachers are so burned out, experts tell Fortune that a lack of work-life balance, high workload, and lack of recognition are often to blame. \u201cBurnout is often the result of extreme stress, mostly at work but also caused by an imbalance in lifestyles more generally,\u201d says Dr. Paras Patel, chief scientific officer at The Zensory. If you feel emotionally exhausted, disconnected from yourself, and unmotivated you may already be burned out, Patel says. \u201cEmerging research has shown key factors that impact burnout include compassion\u2014self-compassion and compassion from others\u2014mental wellbeing, relational wellbeing, worry, pleasure, and motivation.\u201d\u00a0 Although employers often tout their inclusive practices and provision of mental health services, it\u2019s understandable to worry about your career in the aftermath of breaking down in tears in front of your boss and peers. Even the experts Fortune talked to were conflicted on the impact that crying at work can have on progression. \u201cThe key is how the situation is handled,\u201d Dannielle Haig, a qualified business psychologist at DH Consulting explains.  Has this been a one-off, or have you cried regularly at work? Haig adds that proving that you have handled stress in a healthy way is more important for success than an occasional emotional outburst. \u201cEmployers should be mindful not to judge employees harshly for these moments, as they are part of the human experience and can often be a sign of deep commitment and care for their work,\u201d she adds.  \u201cBy fostering an environment that prioritizes mental health and well-being, organizations can not only prevent burnout but also enhance overall productivity and job satisfaction.\u201d More often than not, a crying worker says more about the workplace than the individual. Jasmine Eskenzi, CEO of the wellbeing and productivity app The Zensory says the onus is on managers to look out for indicators of burnout among team members and act fast\u2014or settle with having a toxic culture and high churn rate.\u00a0 She says that burnout in employees could look like: \u2013 an individual not actively engaging in socializing in the workplace\u2013 their output, motivation and enthusiasm could decrease\u2013 delays in completing important tasks\u2013 lack of interest in improving skills\u2013 working on other projects during work time\u2013 feeling lost or disconnected in meetings. \u201cAll of this would not only decrease the company\u2019s productivity but would also have a negative impact on the individuals\u2019 work satisfaction, and if left to continue could result in high staff turnover and low retention rates,\u201d Eskenzi warns.\u00a0 \u201cThis is why, as employers and organizations, it is paramount to look out for these early signs in your teams.\u201d"

        "body": "When Noam Shazeer is thinking, he puts his face in his hands, and goes somewhere else. Not literally, of course. He\u2019s still across from me, in a Character.AI conference room that will later host an employees\u2019 Dungeons & Dragons night he doesn\u2019t attend. But he\u2019s mentally elsewhere, searching for a mathematically perfect answer.\u00a0\u00a0 I asked: \u201cIs there a question you never get, that you wish you did?\u201d Silence. It\u2019s the kind of pause that\u2019s long enough that you start to hear the other person breathe. Long enough, that I wonder how long it\u2019s been. Shazeer lets me watch the gears in his head turn. No one ever does that.\u00a0 We crack our knuckles, laugh, and finally he says: \u201cI guess, why do large language models work?\u201d I lean in. If anyone would know, it\u2019s Shazeer, the CEO and cofounder of Character.AI, and one of the primary architects behind today\u2019s AI landscape. While at Google in 2017, Shazeer co-authored the paper \u201cAttention Is All You Need,\u201d which revolutionized natural language processing and minted the transformer model. The advance would ultimately make ChatGPT\u2019s ascension and the generative AI boom possible, but at the time the paper came out to crickets, Shazeer said. Today, it\u2019s now been cited more than 125,000 times. It\u2019s not crazy to say that Shazeer has altered the course of tech, and certainly AI. (He was accordingly named to the Time100 AI list last year.) Shazeer may be a star Silicon Valley founder, but he feels like a scientist first and foremost. Shazeer left Google during the pandemic to cofound Character.AI with Daniel De Freitas, an AI researcher and longtime Google engineer. Since then, Character\u2019s raised about $150 million from backers like Andreessen Horowitz, Elad Gil, and SV Angel. I interviewed Shazeer a few weeks ago, but this week\u00a0Character.AI has been in the news: The Information reported that Elon Musk\u2019s xAI is looking at a possible acquisition of the company. Character declined comment. Character.AI is a chatbot startup\u2014a platform where users have created millions of chatbots, ranging from Napoleon Bonaparte to Goku from Dragon Ball Z to Shazeer himself. I sometimes use Character for feedback on my published writing, as I think about what works and what doesn\u2019t. I go to a chatbot and say: Stephen King, what do you think of this passage? Joan Didion, which phrases stand out most to you? And Elon Musk, will you ever like anything ever? (Unlikely, Character Elon is pretty ornery in my experience.) I tell Shazeer that I think his chatbots do a great job of reacting, but haven\u2019t yet mastered writing on their own. He\u2019s immediately solutions-oriented. \u201cWe should be able to turn good reactions into good writing,\u201d he said. I should perhaps be grateful that the chatbots aren\u2019t regular Kurt Vonneguts. At least not without a lot of clever prompting. Not yet.\u00a0 \u201cI think roughly everybody\u2019s at a crossroads, because the applications of 2025 and 2026 will potentially be unimaginable in 2024,\u201d said Shazeer. \u201cWe\u2019ll do our best to be on top of them, and be the place where users come to do things they couldn\u2019t have imagined a year ago.\u201d It\u2019s tough to know how to conceptualize our AI future, or when exactly that future will be. OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman this year said that artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is coming in the \u201creasonably close-ish future\u201d but \u201cwill change jobs much less than we all think.\u201d Shazeer\u2019s take is different but compatible: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I particularly care about AGI in the sense of wanting something that can do absolutely everything a person can do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is that the metric? Maybe it\u2019s some sort of angst, or raises questions about purposefulness: What\u2019s the purpose of humans in this world?\u201d It\u2019s a question I lob right back. I watch Shazeer think. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he said, hands over eyes. Beat. \u201cMaybe, again, it\u2019s similar to earlier periods in history, where people felt less powerful?\u201d\u00a0 He lets the question hang, so I offer an idea: Humans will always find a purpose.\u00a0 \u201cAbsolutely, certainly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a religious question.\u201d Shazeer readily talks about AI from a disarmingly existential lens, one that engages with both religion and history, one that\u2019s concerned with the nature of human life.\u00a0 \u201cSomebody living in the Middle Ages would have no frame of reference for this entire room,\u201d said Shazeer. \u201cIf they showed up right here and saw this technology\u2014the conference room speakerphones, the whiteboard\u2014it would just look like magic or a miracle. It\u2019s the same way we\u2019d probably have very little frame of reference for what the world might be like in the future.\u201d I was surprised by my experience sitting across from Shazeer, in part because I was surprised to be there at all. When I was flying to San Francisco to meet him for the first time, he almost canceled on me at the last minute, and I was almost furious. I wondered, was it some kind of Silicon Valley power play?\u00a0 But less than 90 seconds into meeting Shazeer, it was clear that it wasn\u2019t. He\u2019s warm but shy, with a slightly frenzied but totally deadpan sense of humor. When prompted, Shazeer told me a dad joke: \u201cDid you hear the one about the newspaper? No, it\u2019s tear-able!\u201d I suspect he doesn\u2019t especially like doing press, but he\u2019s determined to do so kindly\u2014and carefully.\u00a0He\u2019s someone whose labyrinthine thoughts don\u2019t lend themselves to simplification. He also understands that there\u2019s only so much that he, or anyone, can control. I asked Shazeer his own question: Why do large language models work?\u00a0 \u201cMy best guess is divine benevolence,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. Nobody really understands what\u2019s going on. This is a very experimental science, which nobody\u2019s really used to in the world of computing where everything is operating deterministically. But we just have no clue what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s more like alchemy or whatever chemistry was in the Middle Ages. You experiment, and you have intuitions about why you know how something works. Some of those intuitions are good and some aren\u2019t. You come up with some formulas about what seemed to work well, and try to scale it up.\u201d That makes sense enough. After all, there are all sorts of essential things we don\u2019t entirely understand, from what happens in a burning fire to how gravity really works. But with so many people trying to project certainty (or at least conviction) about how AI works, it was strangely thrilling to hear Shazeer say he doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0 He puts his head in his hands, looks up, and invokes the divine.\u00a0 See you Monday, Allie GarfinkleTwitter: @agarfinksEmail: alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.comSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.

        "body": "So much for retail therapy.After Amazon reported a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for the third quarter on Thursday, sending its shares down more than 7% in after-hours trading, a top company executive posited a unique cause on a call with reporters.  Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that Amazon web traffic patterns indicate that shoppers are distracted by rare, major news events\u2014such as the Olympics and the historically turbulent US presidential race, which has already included both an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden dropping from the race\u2014and are potentially deferring purchases as a result, or just skipping them altogether. Such monumental news events in the past have made it \u201charder to forecast,\u201d Olsavsky said, and company leaders are once again battling with that reality. Amazon said it was forecasting between $154 billion and $158.5 billion in revenue for the current third quarter, a range that suggests sales will likely come in below the average analyst estimate of $158.24 billion.  Rather than seeking comfort in the \u201cbuy now\u201d button, it seems that shoppers are reacting to the roller-coaster news cycle by spending less. Amazon\u2019s revenue in the three months ended June 30 also came in slightly below expectations at $148 billion, though earnings were stronger than expected with net profit of $13.5 billion. While the number of goods \u2014 or units \u2014 sold by Amazon in the quarter was strong, customers favored items at lower price points, according to Olsavsky and CEO Andy Jassy, who made an appearance on a conference call with analysts. Part of that trend is due to economic worries, the executives said they believe, but there is also another factor at play. Amazon has been investing heavily in speeding up delivery times so that customers rely on the retailer more for last-minute needs like non-perishable foods and household and beauty items that typically are inexpensive compared to other categories of products like electronics or apparel. The company is winning share in consumables, but the low average cost per transaction is weighing on revenue. On the bright side for the company, revenue growth inside the Amazon Web Services cloud computing business continues to reaccelerate. Sales growth in the unit accelerated to 18.8%, up from 17.1% in the first three months in the year, driven by customer spending both on Gen AI products and services as well as more traditional cloud infrastructure projects after a period of more cost-focused spending by AWS clients. Jassy reiterated his revelation from last quarter that Gen AI is on pace to drive multiple billions of revenue for AWS this year. To get ahead of that, and other renewed cloud demand, Amazon is on pace to spend more on capital investments in the second half of the year than the $30.5 billion it doled out in the first six months of 2024. The massive cap ex spending is in line with rivals such Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta, which have all reported big increases on infrastructure investments in recent quarters.Amazon\u2019s investments, Olsavsky said, are being made to \u201cdrive revenue and free cash flow for the next decade and beyond.\u201d"

        "body": "Amazon\u00a0reported a boost in its quarterly profits Thursday, but the company missed revenue estimates, sending stocks lower in after-hours trading. The\u00a0Seattle-based tech company\u00a0said it earned $13.5 billion for the April-June period, higher than the $10.99 billion industry analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated. Amazon earned $6.7 billion during the same period last year. Earnings per share for the second quarter came out to $1.26, higher than analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.03. However, investors reacted negatively to other results, leading Amazon shares to fall more than 6% after the closing bell. The company posted revenue of $148 billion, a 10% increase that fell slightly below analyst expectations of $148.67 billion. Amazon also said it expects revenue for the current quarter, which ends Sept. 30, to be between $154.0 billion and $158.5 billion \u2014 lower than the $158.22 billion forecast by analysts. Amazon boosted its spending during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep up with higher demand from consumers who became more reliant on online shopping. But as demand cooled and wider economic conditions pressured other parts of its business, the company aggressively cut costs by eliminating unprofitable businesses and laying off more than 27,000 corporate employees. The cost-cutting has led to growth in profits. However, Amazon is also feeling the benefits of the buzz around generative artificial intelligence, which has helped reaccelerate its\u00a0cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, after it\u00a0experienced a slowdown. The company said Thursday that Amazon Web Services saw a 19% jump in revenue compared to the same period last year. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d Amazon\u00a0CEO Andy Jassy\u00a0said in a statement. The cloud computing unit, whose customers are mostly businesses, has been attempting to lure in more customers with new tools, including a service called Amazon Bedrock that provides companies with access to AI models they can use to make their own applications. In April,\u00a0Jassy said\u00a0AWS was on pace for $100 billion in annual revenue. But the company is also expected to spend more this year to support the unit. During a call with reporters, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Amazon spent more than $30 billion during the first half of the year on capital expenditures, the majority of it to boost infrastructure for AWS, The company expects that to increase during the second half, he said. Like other tech companies, Amazon has been\u00a0ramping up investments\u00a0in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads, Olsavsky said. Among other projects, the company plans to put billions toward additional infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Mississippi, where it has\u00a0secured state incentives\u00a0to build two data centers. \u201cThe key for us is always to make sure that we\u2019re matching that supply and demand, and running it efficiently so we don\u2019t have excess capacity,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a concern right now. Our concern is more on getting the supply.\u201d Meanwhile, revenue for the company\u2019s core e-commerce business grew by 5%, which was more sluggish compared to recent quarters. The numbers did not include sales from Amazon\u2019s annual\u00a0Prime Day\u00a0discount event, which took place last month. Olsavsky said the company came up short on revenue growth in North America because customers were still being cautious with their spending and trading down to cheaper items. Amazon said sales from its advertising business \u2013 which mostly comes from ad listings on its online platform \u2013 jumped by 20%. Earlier this year, the company began placing ads on movies and TV shows found on its Prime Video service to bring in extra dollars. Last month, Prime Video also became one of three companies to sign an\u00a011-year media rights deal\u00a0with the National Basketball Association. But the company faces other challenges. This week, federal regulators said Amazon was\u00a0responsible for the recall\u00a0of more than 400,000 hazardous products that were sold on its platform by third-party sellers and shipped using its fulfillment service. Amazon is also facing an antitrust lawsuit, which alleges it has been overcharging sellers and stifling competition. Amazon\u2019s results followed other earning reports this week from tech giants such as\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Meta\u00a0and\u00a0Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc."

        "body": "Google\u2019s Olympics-themed advertisement for its generative AI chatbot Gemini has some debating what role artificial intelligence should play in our everyday lives. The advertisement, titled \u201cDear Sydney,\u201d features a dad helping his daughter use Gemini to produce an AI-crafted letter to the daughter\u2019s hero, Olympic hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.\u00a0 In the ad, the father asks Gemini to help create a letter \u201ctelling Sydney how inspiring she is, and be sure to mention that my daughter plans on breaking her world record one day. (She says sorry, not sorry.)\u201d On social media, the ad drew backlash from some worried about AI\u2019s role in such an emotional and personal task as writing a fan letter. Several called the message \u201ctone deaf\u201d and accused it of promoting laziness to create a letter devoid of meaning. \u201cHaving a child use Gemini to write a one-time letter, that is supposed to be thoughtful, where spelling and grammar mistakes would have surely been forgiven, is just plain dumb. I find myself judging the dad hard lol,\u201d one user wrote on the subreddit r/CommercialsIHate. Others online said the advertisement, like others promoting Gemini, signaled that tech companies want people to think less and off-load creative thinking or social interactions to machines. One such example criticized on Reddit included a Gemini commercial from May that, among other examples, showed a girl asking the chatbot what to say to her friends while they were sitting in front of her. Shelly Palmer, a media professor at Syracuse University, wrote in a blog post that the father in the ad was acting irresponsibly.\u00a0 \u201cThe father in the video is not encouraging his daughter to learn to express herself. Instead of guiding her to use her own words and communicate authentically, he is teaching her to rely on AI for this critical human skill,\u201d Palmer wrote. In response to a request for comment, a Google spokesperson said the ad was meant to show how Gemini can provide a starting point or draft to help with the writing process. \u201cWe believe that AI can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity, but can never replace it,\u201d the spokesperson said. Despite the online criticism, the \u201cDear Sydney\u201d commercial is one of the better performing Olympic advertisements, according to data from ad testing firm System1, cited by Business Insider.

        "body": "Ohio\u2019s historical society announced a deal Thursday that will allow it to take control of an ancient ceremonial and burial earthworks site located on the site of a golf course, ending years of litigation. Ohio History Connection will pay Moundbuilders Country Club in Newark to buy out its lease and end the long-running legal dispute over the Octagon Earthworks, although the sum is confidential under a settlement agreement. The deal avoids\u00a0a jury trial\u00a0to determine the site\u2019s fair market value that had been repeatedly postponed over the years. The Octagon Earthworks are among eight ancient areas in the Hopewell Earthworks system that were\u00a0named a UNESCO World Heritage Site\u00a0last year. The historical society, a nonprofit state history organization, takes control of them on Jan. 1 and plans to open them to visitors. \u201cOur guiding principles throughout this process have been to enable full public access to the Octagon Earthworks while ensuring Moundbuilders Country Club receives just compensation for the value of its lease on the property,\u201d said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection. \u201cAnd now we have accomplished those things.\u201d David Kratoville, president of the country club\u2019s board of trustees, said he has mixed feelings about coming to the end of the legal battle. He said negotiations over the past two months finally landed on a figure \u201cthat allows us to survive,\u201d but the future of the club remains in limbo. Moundbuilders is in negotiations to buy another property, the nearby public golf course Trout Club, but members gathered at an emotional meeting Monday where owners were unable to make promises for the future, he said. \u201cFor me, the news will be where do we land after 114 years operating on this site,\u201d he said. Built between 2,000 and 1,600 years ago by people from the Hopewell Culture,\u00a0the earthworks\u00a0were host to ceremonies that drew people from across the continent, based on archeological discoveries of raw materials from as far west as the Rocky Mountains. Native Americans constructed the earthworks, including eight long earthen walls, that correspond to lunar movements and align with points where the moon rises and sets over the 18.6-year lunar cycle. The History Connection calls them \u201cpart cathedral, part cemetery and part astronomical observatory.\u201d The historical society owns the disputed earthworks site, but it had been leased to the country club for decades. History Connection had put the value of the site at about $2 million, while the country club was seeking a much higher amount. In 1892, voters in surrounding Licking County enacted a tax increase to preserve what was left of the earthworks. The area was developed as a golf course in 1911, and the state first deeded the 134-acre property to Moundbuilders Country Club in 1933. A county judge ruled in 2019 that the historical society could reclaim the lease via eminent domain. But the club challenged the attempt to take the property, saying the History Connection didn\u2019t make a good- faith offer to purchase the property as required by state law. The country club argued that it had provided proper upkeep of the mound and allowed public access over the years \u2014 albeit only a few days a year. Charles Moses, president of the organization\u2019s board of trustees, said the History Connection is excited for the location to be \u201cfully open to the citizens of Ohio \u2014 and the world.\u201d The settlement will be shared with the judge later this month and the case closed."

        "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is navigating a minefield of political pressure from both Democrats and Republicans.\u00a0 Democrats are pressuring Powell to cut interest rates, which he didn\u2019t do at Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting. Meanwhile, Republicans don\u2019t want Powell to do anything before the election. Yet the central bank is expected to remain rigorously independent to ensure its decisions are made solely based on economic data and market conditions and not influenced by any political considerations.\u00a0 At Wednesday\u2019s meeting Powell said he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d convinced that even the widely expected September rate cut could be apolitical. \u201cWe don\u2019t change anything in our approach to address other factors, like the political calendar,\u201d he told reporters.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the Fed must contend with the politics of an election year, even as it attempts to maintain its crucial arm\u2019s-length distance, according to Columbia Business School economics professor Brett House. \u201cWhile the Fed isn\u2019t immune to politics, it\u2019s not subject to them either,\u201d he told Fortune.\u00a0 The pitch of political voices ratcheted up in the days before and after Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\u00a0 A group of progressive Democratic senators including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) wrote Powell a letter accusing him of delaying rate cuts because of political pressure from Republicans. \u201cThe data appears to clearly justify cutting rates, the failure to do so would indicate that the Fed is giving in to bullying,\u201d the senators wrote.\u00a0 Warren, Hickenlooper, and Whitehouse did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0 Inflation data has been coming down gradually in recent months. The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures index, fell for the past three months. In remarks after Wednesday\u2019s meeting Powell seemed pleased with the state of the labor market, which he said was finally returning to an appropriate balance after being \u201coverheated\u201d in the post-pandemic recovery. However despite these promising trajectories, the Fed chair continued his mantra of wanting to see \u201cmore good data\u201d that indicated these trends weren\u2019t temporary in order to make his final decision.\u00a0 The Democrats felt Powell was waiting unnecessarily and for the wrong reasons. \u201cRefusing to follow the economic data and succumbing to political threats would be a subversion of your mandate,\u201d the three Democratic senators told Powell. \u201cWe urge you to make monetary policy in the interests of the American public, not a particular political party.\u201d Republicans on the other hand didn\u2019t want any rate cuts prior to the election. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think they should [cut rates],\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told Politico earlier this month. \u201cAt this point, anything they do before November would be rightfully\u2014would raise the question of their own independence.\u201d GOP members view a boost to the economy as a blow to their campaign message that the economy is faltering. Former President Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee, has been among the most vocal in pushing the Fed to hold steady. In a February interview, Trump accused Powell of looking to cut rates before the election \u201cfor the sake of maybe getting people elected,\u201d he told Fox Business.\u00a0\u00a0 Still other Republican politicians left the door open for rate cuts, but only if they deemed them appropriate. \u201cIt\u2019s justified if it\u2019s justified,\u201d Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) told Politico Wednesday. \u201cBut the fact is, they\u2019re not there yet. They haven\u2019t achieved price stability yet.\u201d There is no evidence the Fed would cut rates if the macroeconomic picture did not warrant doing so. Powell said the Fed would only look at the data when making its considerations. \u201cThis is my fourth presidential election at the Fed; I can tell you this is how we think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that we do before, during, or after the election will be based on the data, the outlook, and the balance of risks and not on anything else.\u201d Even if interest rates did get cut before the election, their impact on everyday people may be limited and indirect. A cut would ease some pressures on borrowing costs, but its full effect would take months to flow through the economy to impact interest rates for things like auto loans, mortgages, and bank loans. A cut in September would only leave about a month and a half before Election Day, hardly enough time for meaningful macroeconomic change.\u00a0\u00a0 The consensus is that \u201cFed rate movements take approximately eight to 12 months to have a widespread economic impact,\u201d said Kathleen Grace, CEO of Fiduciary Family Office, a firm that manages the personal wealth of high-net-worth individuals. \u201cHowever, what consumers typically experience is a more immediate market reaction to changes in policy.\u201d\u00a0 There is a minority of analysts who believe there are economic reasons the Fed will wait until after the election. They consider the current labor market to be too strong to justify a rate cut, according to Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, an ETF provider with about $40 billion in assets under management. \u201cWe believe the market may still be too optimistic around a September cut,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cOne cut in December remains our base case unless the next two job reports show a material slowdown in the labor market.\u201d Meanwhile, as the Democrats and Republicans bicker over whether the Fed is too political or whether September is the right time for a rate cut, Powell reminded everyone the central bank hadn\u2019t made up its mind one way or the other. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the data will reveal,\u201d Powell said.\u00a0\u00a0 Will Daniel contributed reporting to this article."

        "body": "Falling or flatlining home values can mean different things, good or bad, depending who you are. Either way, it\u2019s happening in the Sunbelt, the Southwestern region known for its warm climate and prosperous economic growth. But the area everyone loves to talk about could return to its former glory, if one economics research firm\u2019s prediction comes to fruition.\u00a0 \u201cHouse price inflation is 6% nationally, but that masks a lot of regional variation,\u201d Capital Economics economist Thomas Ryan wrote in an analysis earlier this week. Metropolitan areas such as Allentown, Phila.; Bridgeport, Conn.; Rochester, N.Y.; San Diego; and Los Angeles have all seen their home values rise by double digits (with the exception of the latter, although it\u2019s pretty close). \u201cConversely, price growth is lackluster, or in some cases even negative in the Sunbelt markets which thrived after the pandemic,\u201d he continued, pointing to Cape Coral, Fla.; New Orleans; and Austin.\u00a0 Separately, earlier this summer, an analysis from Redfin found that home prices were falling in four major metropolitan areas across the country from a year earlier; three were in Texas. Another found that housing markets in western Florida were cooling faster than anywhere else in the country.\u00a0 But it isn\u2019t that people in these metros aren\u2019t having kids or that they\u2019re losing steam following their hot pandemic days; it\u2019s supply.\u00a0 Developers have been feverishly building homes to meet wildly hot demand\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened. In the spring, it was announced that J.P. Morgan would finance roughly 35 build-to-rent communities across the Sunbelt, totaling $770 million. In the South, according to Capital Economics, four times as many houses have been built in the last three or so years than in the Northeast. And the wave of new supply in the Sunbelt has tipped the scale to favor buyers, Ryan said. \u201cSignificant homebuilding in the Sunbelt region over the past three years has restored housing inventory to pre-pandemic levels, which is why house prices there have stalled,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cIn contrast, markets in the Northeast and California, which haven\u2019t seen the same level of new construction and where inventory remains historically low, are experiencing double-digit house price inflation.\u201d It\u2019s a tale as old as time. Urban economists, housing policy analysis, and real estate executives have long stressed that the key to pushing home prices and rents down is building more homes. The country is missing millions of homes, but obviously there are places where the shortage is more acute. California has become a de facto ground zero for the country\u2019s housing crisis: It accounts for almost half of all unsheltered people in America and its home prices and rents far outpace typical states. The answer is clear: There aren\u2019t enough homes. Therefore, prices are still rising because of low levels of inventory.\u00a0 Consider this: in Los Angeles, the average home value is about $973,000, and it\u2019s up almost 6% from a year earlier. In Austin, the average home value is about $545,000, but it\u2019s down more than 4% from last year, per Zillow. \u201cIn Northeastern metros with the fastest-rising house prices, inventory remains 60%\u201370% below pre-pandemic levels,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cCalifornian metros show similar low inventory and strong price growth. In contrast, in Sunbelt markets where house prices are weakest, particularly in Texas, Florida and Louisiana, inventory is back at, or even above, pre-pandemic levels.\u201d\u00a0 So why the difference in inventory? Several reasons, but mostly, it\u2019s much easier to build in the Sunbelt than anywhere else. Last year, Texas built more homes than any other state in the country. Moreover, its top three metros by housing starts built 300% more homes than California\u2019s, even though their populations are smaller: Dallas, Houston, and Austin built roughly 93,600 homes last year; to compare, Riverside, Sacramento, and Los Angeles built a total of 23,400 homes.\u00a0 Since January 2021, according to Capital Economics, more than 2 million single-family homes have been built in the South \u201cas homebuilders responded to the population and house price boom,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cThis is more than four times the number of single-family homes completed in the Northeast, where stricter zoning requirements and limited availability of land have constrained new construction.\u201d Newly built homes make up between 20% and 40% of home sales in Texas, Florida, and Louisiana metros, he explained; it\u2019s much fewer in the Northeast. There\u2019s the lock-in effect, too, which constrains existing supply because homeowners refuse to sell for fear of losing their low mortgage rates; it\u2019s especially prevalent in California coastal markets, compared to Florida and Texas, both filled with older baby boomers who are mortgage-free, as Zillow has found.\u00a0 But the Sunbelt\u2019s falling or flatlining home prices won\u2019t last forever if Capital Economics is correct when it suggests a reversal in trends will occur. \u201cThe Sunbelt will continue to attract strong economic immigration, so the current excess housing supply should quickly get absorbed,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cAnd with new construction already falling in the region, excess supply should be less of an issue down the line. Therefore, we expect house prices in the Sunbelt to recover. Indeed, in places like Austin, Dallas, and Jacksonville, it appears the worst is already over.\u201d Not to mention, his team suggests, once the housing world normalizes and the lock-in effect eases, home prices will ease, too, even in the Northeast and California. We\u2019ll see if that happens."

        "body": "Home prices are still high, and so are mortgage rates. The kids aren\u2019t all right.\u00a0 The homeownership rate for people younger than 35 years old, who are generally younger millennials and older Gen Zers, fell to its lowest point in more than four years in the second quarter, data from the U.S. Census Bureau released yesterday shows. \u201cHomeownership for households 35 and younger is still higher than pre-pandemic, but down from pandemic-era highs, when low mortgage rates enabled home purchasing,\u201d a Realtor.com analysis of the data read. The pandemic fueled a housing boom, mostly because mortgage rates were the lowest they\u2019d ever been, but also because people could work from anywhere. Because of that, home prices skyrocketed; they\u2019ve risen roughly 50% since the start of the pandemic. But then inflation reached a four-decade high, and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates multiple times, indirectly bumping up mortgage rates. The combo has been an affordability killer. The average 30-year fixed daily mortgage rate is currently 6.70%, and the weekly one is slightly higher. In a related manner, the Fed met today but left interest rates unchanged, at the highest they\u2019ve been in 23 years. Either way, in the second quarter of this year, the total homeownership rate for the country was relatively unchanged, at 65.6%. It\u2019s lower than the rate in the early months of the pandemic, and it\u2019s declined steadily since then. Fewer people are buying and selling homes, and last year alone, existing-home sales fell to their lowest point in close to three decades.\u00a0 And they\u2019re still depressed: In June, existing-home sales dropped 5.4% from a year earlier. (All the while, the median existing-home price topped another all-time high, at $426,900.)\u00a0 So it\u2019s no secret that the homeownership rate among younger cohorts is falling. Just consider, the salary needed to afford a starter home has almost doubled since the pandemic to almost $76,000 a year, and not to mention, million-dollar starter homes are more common than ever.\u00a0 \u201cOver the last couple of years younger buyers have suffered the brunt of climbing prices and mortgage rates more than any other group,\u201d said the report author Hannah Jones in a statement. Jones is Realtor.com\u2019s senior economic research analyst. \u201cMany buyers under the age of 35 are first-time buyers and therefore do not have existing home equity to leverage into a home purchase, like many older generations do.\u201d She continued: \u201cSaving for a down payment has become increasingly challenging as both rents and home prices hover near pandemic-era highs. Today\u2019s housing market asks a lot of buyers, and younger buyers who earn lower wages, have less savings, and do not have equity in an existing home are less able to compete than older, more established buyers.\u201d But while the younger group saw their homeownership rate fall on a quarterly and yearly basis, some of the older generations saw theirs rise. Two groups, people between 35 and 44 years old, and those between 45 and 54 years old, saw their homeownership rate increase from the first to second quarter of the year.\u00a0 There were different outcomes by income, as you might have anticipated. In the second quarter, households that made more than, or the same, as the median income saw an increase in the homeownership rate to 79.2%, from 78.8% in the first quarter of this year. However, households with incomes below the median saw their homeownership rate fall from the first quarter to the second to 52.1%. It fell from a year earlier, too. \u201cAs home prices and mortgage rates remain elevated, financing a home purchase will remain prohibitively expensive for many households, especially those earning less than the national median income,\u201d Realtor.com said.\u00a0 Still, what we do know is that things could be looking up. Home price inflation is slowing,\u00a0mortgage rates are coming down, and inventory is increasing. But that isn\u2019t to say housing will be affordable again, it just might not get worse.\u00a0"

People are going after experiences, fuelling the sports and music tourism industry, which is now set to double in size over the next eight years, according to a report by Collinson International, a global travel company that operates a slew of airport priority and lounge programs. It found that the sports and music tourism economy, valued at $571 billion cumulatively in 2023, will balloon to $1.5 trillion by 2032.\u00a0 Tournaments like the Formula One Grand Prix and the Euros have spurred the growth of sports tourism, which accounts for a large piece of the experience pie. Sports fans are among the biggest spenders on trips as over half of them pay more than $500 per trip.\u00a0 \u201cIt is clear that sports and music tourism is booming and event travellers have high aspirations,\u201d the report said.\u00a0 Collinson\u2019s research considers 8,537 travelers who flew to an event\u2014either internationally or domestically\u2014from 17 countries. The report identifies streaming as an added reason for this trend as more people engage with international events online. Formula One is an example of this\u2014it has shot to fame in recent years, thanks to the Netflix series Drive to Survive. That has not only pushed up viewership for the various Grands Prix but it\u2019s also lured more people to watch it in person, even if at a higher price tag. \u201cRevenge spending,\u201d a trend where people began splurging more on experiences after pandemic-linked restrictions were lifted, also has had a part to play. Affordable travel has put these experiences further within the reach of people than before. \u201cThe growing and global fanbase that will travel to iconic sports and music events is looking for unforgettable experiences and are prepared to spend significantly to make their trip extra special,\u201d said Collinson International CEO Christopher Evans.\u00a0\u00a0 This presents a big opportunity for businesses and airline companies as many of the experience enthusiasts are willing to travel internationally. Those aged between 25 and 34\u2014largely Millennials\u2014are the biggest spenders on both, experiences and at airports. Although airlines have had a tricky year so far, the rise of the experience economy could only mean more demand for travel in the future. There\u2019s been no dearth of opportunities for those seeking experiences out. In the sports world, the FIFA World Cup took place in 2022 while the Paris Olympics are ongoing. Last year, pop stars Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift went on world tours, and so far this year, we\u2019ve seen high-profile events like Eurovision 2024 in Sweden and the upcoming Lollapalooza in Germany.\u00a0\u00a0 While the events are spread out around the world, London, Paris, and Barcelona are Europe\u2019s magnets for sports and music tourism, while New York and Dubai are also popular with experience-chasers.

In a letter to the transport ministry, taxi unions said that the Games had been \u201chugely disappointing\u201d for the drivers of licensed taxis of which there are 20,000 in Paris alone. \u201cDemand is slowing and the entire profession is being prevented from simply doing their job because of these Games,\u201d said the letter, seen by AFP. The number of additional visitors drawn by the Olympics had failed to make up for \u201cthe impact of traffic restrictions, the closure of venues and the impact of usual customers staying away\u201d, it said. The unions demanded the creation of a \u201ccompensation fund\u201d that they said should cover income lost for the seven-month period during which public spaces were being taken over for the Games. Several venues in and around Paris, but also in Marseille were blocked off for several weeks before the Games started on July 26. In response to the letter, Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said in a social media post that taxis and ride-hailing services would now be allowed to enter the so-called \u201cred zones\u201d around Olympics venues, which were previously off-limits for motor vehicles. Now that the high-security opening ceremony was in the past, several safety measures had been lifted and traffic was becoming more fluid, the minister said. The government has encouraged French residents to go on holiday or work remotely during the Games, further dampening demand and contributing to a sharp fall in business compared to the same period in 2023, the unions said. Some drivers had seen their income fall by 40 or 50 percent, they said. Last month, trade groups said that Paris shops, restaurants, bars and clubs were facing an \u201cunprecedented slump in business and footfall\u201d, blaming in part the \u201cheavy security measures\u201d during the Games."

A COVID-era bump in demand for all things tech helped VC funds raise and invest record amounts in 2021, as an unprecedented 340 new U.S. startups achieved \u201cunicorn\u201d status, or valuations of $1\u00a0billion or more. Then, in 2022, came a correction, triggered by high interest rates and a slumping stock market\u2014a decline that bloodied balance sheets and left many people wondering whether the VC model itself was broken.\u00a0 It\u2019s against this backdrop that Botha, who appears to be equal parts jock and nerd (a true unicorn) has taken the mantle. The former wunderkind and charter member of the PayPal mafia became senior steward, Sequoia\u2019s term for its top job, in July 2022. (After a reorganization, his title is now just \u201csteward.\u201d) It\u2019s the culmination of a steady rise: Botha, who turns 51 in September, joined the firm in 2003 and had been running Sequoia\u2019s U.S. and Europe business since 2017, scoring lucrative wins over the years with investments in YouTube, Instagram, and Square, among other blockbusters.\u00a0 All along, Botha has kept a low profile: \u201cMy inclination was never to run to the spotlight,\u201d he says. But leading Sequoia comes with certain demands, not just to set strategy internally but to explain it externally. So far, Botha\u2019s run has coincided not just with VC turmoil but with blunders specific to Sequoia (more on that shortly). Still, the firm has ridden out the downturn better than most. It distributed more than $43\u00a0billion to its investors over the past five years, including $10\u00a0billion in 2023. Its limited partners, largely made up of endowments, charitable foundations, and nonprofits, seem satisfied: Indeed, the base of investors in Sequoia\u2019s primary fund grew slightly from 2022 to 2023, from 354 to 358.\u00a0 It helps that the Bay Area-based firm has delivered hit after hit, decade after decade. Sequoia has led investments in tech titans including Apple, Cisco, and Google, plus newer names like Nvidia, Airbnb, DoorDash, and WhatsApp, minting billions in returns along the way. More than 25% of the overall market capitalization of the Nasdaq\u2014more than $7\u00a0trillion, as of mid-July\u2014is composed of Sequoia-backed companies. Sequoia\u2019s kingmaker position is also evident in less quantifiable ways: Securing dollars from the firm is one of tech\u2019s ultimate seals of approval.\u00a0 That stellar reputation is precisely what makes Botha\u2019s job so hard. The task isn\u2019t so much to fix what\u2019s broken as it is to keep what works from breaking\u2014and not to be the guy who ends a five-decade winning streak. And what\u2019s kept Sequoia at the top in the past won\u2019t necessarily keep it there\u2014especially in a VC industry that\u2019s scrambling to adapt. \u201cI want Sequoia to thrive,\u201d says Botha. \u201cAt an organization that has achieved [so much], this is more daunting. It\u2019s much easier to be the underdog.\u201d That said, there\u2019s a reason Sequoia is the alpha: Its culture from the get-go has been one of near-paranoid competitiveness, ruthless honesty, and a constant need for change. Botha has become a paragon of these qualities: His probabilistic-thinking acumen and factual recall make him a force at decision-making time; his intense curiosity helps him question old ways of deciding. Partners credit him with reshaping the way Sequoia thinks\u2014just in time for a moment of industrywide reset (not to mention an AI revolution).\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re only as good as our next investment,\u201d Botha and his partners like to say. But any fear of failure on Botha\u2019s part is tempered with a relentless drive to master whatever he pursues, something he internalized as a boy in South Africa, and, yes, on the rugby field. Over the course of several interviews that took place at Sequoia\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters, a library in Burlingame, and at his Hillsborough home, Botha kept returning to the ultimate sports aphorism. The steward of Sequoia told me any chance he got: \u201cWinning isn\u2019t everything, it\u2019s the only thing.\u201d In mid-May, Sequoia gathered its partners and founders for a two-day retreat on a cattle ranch in California\u2019s San Benito County. The dusty but picturesque venue was nestled so deep in rolling hills that there\u2019s little cellular reception. There wasn\u2019t even an address\u2014invitees were sent a set of longitude and latitude coordinates and told to download directions before they lost signal.\u00a0 Dubbed Base Camp, Sequoia\u2019s far-from-Silicon-Valley get-together is a fixture for its portfolio companies. Founders from all over the world attended this year\u2019s event, which featured master classes on \u201ceffective founder storytelling\u201d and \u201cclear thinking,\u201d plus a paella dinner under the stars. There were talks from Jensen Huang of Nvidia (a Sequoia investment in 1993), Fidji Simo of Instacart (Sequoia-funded in 2013), and the former captain of South Africa\u2019s rugby team (of course), who bore an uncanny resemblance to Botha. But Base Camp is also about camping. Just a short walk from the barn where the talks took place was a grassy field dotted with neat rows of cream-colored yurts, the sleeping quarters for attendees. \u201cThe first year, it was so cold I thought we were going to die,\u201d says Julia Hartz, cofounder and CEO of ticketing platform Eventbrite, one of Botha\u2019s investments. \u201cIt\u2019s so Sequoia to take founders out and try to kill them just to prove a point.\u201d While this year\u2019s weather was milder, the tone set by Sequoia was similarly ascetic. The message, repeated in toasts and talks and even spelled out in a book given to founders, was clear: Being an entrepreneur, especially one backed by Sequoia, means embarking on a journey that requires intellectual honesty and grueling work. Shared outdoor bathrooms? Sleeping in yurts? These elements were to be embraced, not just endured, in the spirit of building grit and resilience. \u00a0 Sequoia has long been known for this demanding, direct ethos. The approach isn\u2019t just for founders: Its internal culture is one of radical candor and open disagreement. Partners have veto power over deals. For each funding decision, the process includes a \u201cblind\u201d pre-vote meant to discourage groupthink. Botha sometimes pushes partners to reargue a case if he feels they\u2019re being too positive.\u00a0 The steward has also welcomed pressure-testing from Sequoia\u2019s own investors. \u201cHe\u2019s always looking for critical feedback, which is not something you hear from many firms,\u201d says Eric Doppstadt, chief investment officer of the Ford Foundation, the first LP to invest in Sequoia.\u00a0 Since taking over, Botha has had ample opportunity to receive such feedback, both solicited and unsolicited. There was the firm\u2019s 2023 decision to decouple from its China business, partly because of deteriorating relations between the U.S. and China\u2014a move some thought was overdue. A boardroom spat last winter at Swedish fintech Klarna, involving former and current Sequoia partners, created embarrassing optics.\u00a0 But perhaps the biggest blight was the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, in November 2022. Sequoia invested $150\u00a0million in FTX, all of which it lost, and critics savaged the firm for failing to better vet the company. (FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was later convicted of a massive fraud.) Botha ran to the fire: He quickly organized a call with investors both to apologize for the massive loss of capital and to offer concrete ways Sequoia would improve its due diligence.\u00a0 LPs were mollified, and some were impressed. It was yet another twist in a rocky year\u2014and another reminder that the firm can never stop adapting. \u201cIt\u2019s not a profession where you master it and you\u2019re done,\u201d he says. \u201cThe business keeps changing, and the technologies you invest in keep changing, and you need to constantly reinvent yourself.\u201d One of the ways Botha has tried to reinvent Sequoia is by departing from the traditional 10-year cycle of VC funds. Such funds usually reap their returns through startup \u201cexits\u201d\u2014IPOs or acquisitions. But they often miss out on the enormous value\u00a0that can be created\u00a0after a company goes public. What\u2019s more, funds\u2019 10-year timelines can induce angst when exits slow down due to short-term market downturns\u00a0or crackdowns on M&A activity.\u00a0 That\u2019s why, in February 2022, Sequoia launched the Sequoia Capital Fund, an \u201copen-ended liquid portfolio\u201d whose holdings include post-IPO equity in portfolio companies, along with allocations in more traditional funds. The firm is going all in, reorganizing itself around this new structure. Botha\u2019s timing was unlucky, as tech stocks tanked that year. But in some ways, that was the point: The strategy is meant to help Sequoia capitalize on investments over the long term, whether the market is up or down. Botha has also had to be creative when it comes to providing more immediate liquidity to investors , due to the current scarcity of opportunities for startup exits on both the IPO and acquisitions fronts\u2014and, in some cases, a slower-than-average timeline for building companies. In mid-July, Sequoia wrote a letter to its LPs, announcing that it would purchase up to $861 million of their shares in Stripe, a fintech investment the firm first made in 2010. The offer was made to those LPs who had invested in Sequoia\u2019s \u201cLegacy Funds,\u201d those raised more than 10 years ago, and the acquiring entities would be newer funds, including the Sequoia Capital Fund. The move, according to Sequoia, was meant to offer LPs looking for liquidity a way to cash out on some of their holdings in Stripe. But it was also a message that the firm was doubling down on its faith in Stripe\u2019s long-term success, which the company\u2019s founders, a pair of Irish brothers whose Bay Area-based startup is now valued at $70 billion, heard loud and clear. \u201cMaybe Stripe has stayed private for longer than the external world anticipated, but it\u2019s not longer than we anticipated,\u201d says cofounder Patrick Collison, who explains that because Stripe is an \u201cinfrastructure\u201d company, providing a new technology platform for payments, it takes longer to build than, say, a stand-alone app. \u201cThe good news about infrastructure companies is that they can become very large, and the bad news is that it takes decades for the story to play out.\u201d While some LPs might want or need liquidity much earlier than that, Botha certainly has the temperament to analyze Sequoia\u2019s investments, and just about every other decision in his life, with an eye for future outcomes.\u00a0\u201cHe very much focuses on passing the marshmallow test of what he wants to accomplish for the long term,\u201d says Alfred Lin, a Sequoia partner who joined the firm in 2010. Botha is indeed measured, analytical, methodical: He can barely have a conversation without bringing up probability distribution curves. At times, listening to him is like reading the world\u2019s most eclectic encyclopedia. He can break down the impact of cold-water currents on Bay Area microclimates just as easily as he explains the workings of a rugby scrum. Even when telling jokes (he keeps a book of them at his bedside), he delivers humor with a didactic twist.\u00a0 But everything he says is tinged with the soft accent of Afrikaans, his mother tongue. That\u2019s a reminder of the unusual path that eventually led him to Sequoia\u2014and of the hidden layers of his personality. \u201cDid you know he makes jerky from exotic meats?\u201d Hartz of Eventbrite tells me. \u201cSeriously, you should ask him what he eats for breakfast.\u201d The next time I see Botha, I do just that, and he proceeds to rattle off the day\u2019s protein-heavy menu. \u201cThis morning, it was some raw salmon and chicken meatballs,\u201d he says. \u201cYesterday I had bison.\u201d Venison, impala, and whole chickens\u2014we\u2019re talking feet and head still on\u2014are also staples in Botha\u2019s fridge. (A private chef handles the decapitating and cooking.) The avid foodie likes to say that a meal without meat is a snack\u2014a common attitude in his home country. Botha was born to a pair of star-crossed teenagers in Pretoria in 1973. His parents split when he was 3; he grew up with his mother but remained close to his dad\u2019s side of the family. He is named for his paternal grandfather, an Afrikaans tradition. \u201cAt my baptism, there is a photo of four generations of Roelof Bothas,\u201d he says: his dad, his grandfather, his great-grandfather, and himself. (Later, his dad would have another son and name him\u2009\u2026\u2009Roelof Botha.) It\u2019s Botha\u2019s grandfather who loomed largest in his life. Nicknamed Pik, the elder Botha served as South Africa\u2019s foreign minister in the last years of the apartheid regime, later joining Nelson Mandela\u2019s government after democratic elections ended apartheid. As a child, Botha had rare exposure to global dignitaries and business leaders who came to meet his grandfather. One of his earliest memories is of walking in his grandfather\u2019s garden with Pik as journalists photographed the two of them. \u201cI had a sense of the impact that somebody can have in the world,\u201d he says of those days.\u00a0 $43 billion But that understanding went hand in hand with immense pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a burden you carry,\u201d says Botha, \u201cthat I\u2019m named after this person, and I have to live up to this person.\u201d There was another downside: Some assumed that any recognition he received was the product of nepotism. \u201cNo matter how well he did in something, it must have been because of\u2009\u2026\u2009well, you can finish that sentence,\u201d says Doug Leone, Sequoia\u2019s former senior steward, whom Botha succeeded in 2022. \u201cAnd that just drove him crazy.\u201d\u00a0 It also drove him to distinguish himself. In elementary school, Botha scored so high on an aptitude exam that the district brought in a psychologist for an assessment\u2014and to make sure he wasn\u2019t cheating. He studied up on how to study, reading books about best test- and note-taking tactics. (His handwriting is freakishly neat.) In college, he picked one of the most grueling majors, actuarial science\u2014and earned the best undergraduate grade point average in the history of the University of Cape Town.\u00a0 \u201cWhile other kids were spending their spring break surfing, Roelof and I met in \u2018nerd camp,\u2019\u201d says Matt Rabinowitz, a fellow South African and the cofounder and CEO of genetic testing company Natera, which became a Sequoia investment in 2007.\u00a0 Botha applied the same drive to his extracurriculars: playing for the top rugby team at his high school, competing in math and science \u201cOlympiads.\u201d It was around this time that the family doctor approached his mom and stepdad to express concern that Botha would burn out because of his obsessive studying and the intensity with which he approached pretty much everything. His response was to double down. \u201cI was like, I\u2019ll show you,\u201d says Botha.  \u201cI don\u2019t think Roelof has ever had less than 100% on any exam,\u201d says Leone, with hints of both admiration and disgust in his voice. So straitlaced and focused was he that it was his mom who suggested he get an earring. He refused. To this day, Botha doesn\u2019t curse, saying that profanity is a \u201csloppy\u201d way of expressing yourself. Despite his stellar record in South Africa, Botha felt that the only way to truly make a name for himself was to go somewhere where his name didn\u2019t mean anything to anyone. After college, Botha worked for consultant McKinsey\u2019s local office, where one of his managers, a Stanford alum, suggested that Botha apply for its business school. Botha made the cut, packed his bags, and landed in Palo Alto at the age of 24.\u00a0 Soon enough, he fell in love with Silicon Valley and its seemingly endless opportunities\u2014and with his future wife, Huifen Chan, a fellow Stanford student. True to his track record, Botha graduated at the top of his class\u2014this time without anyone assuming he had received preferential treatment. And yet it was a South African connection that propelled him into the center of the action. In the fall of 1999, a Stanford classmate introduced Botha to Elon Musk, a fellow South African who was running an online bank called X.com. Musk saw something in Botha and worked hard to persuade him to come to X.com, which was about to merge with another firm to create what would become PayPal.\u00a0 Botha, who had assumed he\u2019d end up working with something cerebral like exotic derivatives, finally joined the startup in the spring of 2000. \u201cI took the plunge,\u201d says Botha. \u201cAnd then, two weeks later, the Nasdaq crashed.\u201d But even in those dark moments, there was the thrill of being a part of something potentially big and belonging to a team of intense, opinionated high performers. This was the group that Fortune later christened the PayPal mafia\u2014a cadre of future A-list investors and founders that also included Peter Thiel, David Sacks, and Reid Hoffman. \u201cWe all worked very hard and yet he stood out,\u201d says Max Levchin, another PayPal mafioso, who is now cofounder and CEO of a fintech company called Affirm. Botha was distinct not just because, as Levchin recalls, the South African used the word \u201cspectacles\u201d instead of simply saying \u201cglasses.\u201d He had a quiet but fierce drive to win. And he was a team player.\u00a0 \u201cHe didn\u2019t require the center of the stage,\u201d says Levchin.\u00a0 For all its talent, PayPal faced significant obstacles\u2014including, increasingly, Musk himself. Musk was advocating unpopular moves, like killing off the PayPal brand even though consumers liked it. Botha became part of a core group that campaigned to remove Musk as CEO. \u201cThere were a lot of people at the company who thought I was his golden boy,\u201d says Botha. \u201cBut he was not running the company well.\u201d  While Musk was on his honeymoon, Botha and other mutineers met with PayPal\u2019s lead investors to make their case. Those investors? Sequoia Capital. Musk was soon ousted, and Botha caught the eye of Sequoia partner Michael Moritz, who sat on PayPal\u2019s board, and was co-head of Sequoia, along with Leone.\u00a0Botha later became CFO, and working with Sequoia on PayPal\u2019s IPO deepened the relationship.\u00a0 Sequoia was already a Silicon Valley legend. Don Valentine, a former semiconductor exec famed for his eye for talent, started the firm in 1972. His first investment was in a fledgling video game company called Atari, which eventually sold to Warner Communications for a then unheard-of $28\u00a0million, a 3x return. An even better return on that investment was an introduction to a young technician at Atari: Steve Jobs. In 1978, Valentine put $150,000 into Apple, and the rest was tech history.\u00a0 From the get-go, Sequoia\u2019s culture was unique among a growing crop of fledgling VC firms. While its initial logo more closely resembled a marijuana leaf, its branding was all about longevity and stability\u2014Sequoias, one of the largest trees in existence, can live for thousands of years.\u00a0 \u201cDon didn\u2019t name it \u2018Valentine Ventures,\u2019\u201d says Doppstadt of the Ford Foundation. \u201cHe wanted to convey that there was something larger than him involved in the firm.\u201d Doppstadt refers to Botha as Valentine\u2019s \u201cspiritual grandson,\u201d saying the younger investor exemplifies the \u201cspirit of Sequoia.\u201d But in the earlier days of his career, Botha wasn\u2019t an obvious fit. In 2003, after a monthslong interview process, Botha was on the verge of getting an offer. But some Sequoia leaders worried that Botha was missing a critical strand in his DNA: a humanity gene, as Leone calls it. Leone recalls partners wondering: \u201cIs he normal? Can we work with him? Can he be part of a team?\u201d Leone says Valentine himself wondered how Botha would handle failure, given that he\u2019d had so much success. (Valentine died in 2019.) Leone was tasked to suss out what Botha was really like. \u201cWhen I started going there, we talked a lot about rugby,\u201d says Leone. \u201cI don\u2019t know rugby, but Roelof swears there is no team sport like rugby.\u201d And talking about extreme competition and teamwork, it turned out, uncovered Botha\u2019s emotive side. Indeed, those who know Botha best describe him as unexpectedly sentimental. (During our conversations, Botha teared up several times\u2014once, for example, when talking about his late stepfather, who played a pivotal role in his life.)\u00a0 Proving his ability to emote was critical to Botha\u2019s hiring; keeping feelings in check eventually proved just as important. Botha hit a home run early on, investing in 2005 in a little-known video-sharing site called YouTube, which Google acquired for $1.65\u00a0billion just a year later. But then he entered what VCs call the Valley of Despair\u2014when bets aren\u2019t paying off, or worse, are leading to loss after loss.\u00a0 \u00a0 Botha credits Leone and Jim Goetz, another senior partner, for supporting him without coddling him. The experience gave Botha empathy for the failures that almost all founders go through. He often talks about \u201ccrucible moments\u201d that shape the trajectory of a company or entrepreneur. This was one of his own. He eventually snapped his losing streak, investing in companies including Instagram, Tumblr, and genetic-testing company Natera, all of which earned substantial exits. For years, Botha wrote \u201c10 to the power of 9\u201d at the right-hand corner of each sheet of paper in his copiously filled, impeccably legible notebooks. It was a reminder of a goal he had set for himself: to produce $1\u00a0billion in gains for Sequoia. He hit that milestone in 2015.\u00a0 He also repaired the relationship that had launched his Silicon Valley career. About a decade ago, Botha and Musk sat down for lunch at Tesla headquarters. For the first time, they spoke about their upbringing in South Africa. \u201cWe both felt empathy for each other,\u201d says Botha. \u201cThat rekindled our ability to have a conversation.\u201d It also opened the door to investments in Musk\u2019s new companies. In May 2022, Sequoia announced that it had contributed to Musk\u2019s $44\u00a0billion takeover of Twitter, creating the roller-coaster-riding company now known as X. Sequoia was not an early backer of SpaceX, to Botha\u2019s regret, but it placed a late-stage bet on the company in 2019. And this year, it invested in yet another Musk company, participating in a $6\u00a0billion round of funding in xAI\u2014part of a focus on artificial intelligence that has become a hallmark of Botha\u2019s stewardship. \u00a0 Sequoia is no AI newbie. The firm put money in OpenAI in 2021, before ChatGPT was cool. But under Botha, it has increased the intensity of its AI focus: Last year, 60% of Sequoia\u2019s new investments were AI-focused; in 2024 so far, it\u2019s made at least 10 such investments.\u00a0 When I talk with Botha in mid-June, he\u2019s pondering a new puzzle: AI\u2019s sky-high computing costs. \u201cIt\u2019s unsustainable at this level,\u201d he says. But he\u2019s jazzed about a new Sequoia startup called Fireworks. He explains that its goal is to make inference\u2014the process of deploying AI to draw conclusions from new data\u2014\u201cway less expensive.\u201d The company that reaches that goal, he implies, could have Google-like upside. Whatever tech Sequoia is assessing, Botha wants it to do so with a fresh mindset. Jim Goetz, who was Sequoia\u2019s steward for the U.S. and Europe until he passed the baton to Botha in 2017, says Botha has reshaped the firm\u2019s decision-making strategy in fundamental ways. Botha has rolled out \u201cpre-parades\u201d\u2014thought experiments in which partners imagine not just what can go wrong but the best-case scenario of each potential investment. He\u2019s also brought in learnings from behavioral psychology, including prospect theory, which asserts that people feel losses more deeply than gains, sometimes leading to faulty decisions. \u201cWe\u2019ve modified our entire investment process to benefit\u201d from such approaches, Goetz says.\u00a0 Botha has also emphasized becoming more friendly and transparent with entrepreneurs. Sequoia\u2019s longtime kingmaker status led it to come across as elitist to some. But Botha has helped combat that perception, multiple founders told me. Jack Dorsey first pitched Sequoia on his payment player Square in 2010. \u201cThey were preachy and condescending,\u201d Dorsey says of the firm; still, he wanted, and eventually got, Botha on his board. \u201cAs the former CFO of PayPal, Roelof had a bunch of experience we wanted,\u201d recalls Dorsey. \u201cThe most helpful thing that any board member can do is provide context, and he\u2019s done a lot of that.\u201d\u00a0 Botha, Dorsey adds, remains \u201cthe only investor that\u2019s reached out to ask what his firm can do better.\u201d (Dorsey told Botha that Sequoia should encourage more engineers to contribute to open-source code; Botha took it to heart, starting an open-source fellowship program.) Today, Botha remains a director at Block, the company Square eventually became a part of; he also sits on the boards of eight other companies, including MongoDB and Unity Technologies. Kevin Systrom, the cofounder of Instagram, says his relationship with Sequoia, which joined his series\u00a0B round in 2012, was also built on rapport with Botha. \u201cHe\u2019s not your typical VC sales guy archetype, where he\u2019s schmoozing you and taking you to play golf, and I really found myself drawn to that,\u201d says Systrom.\u00a0 There\u2019s another way in which Botha does not fit the VC mold, or at least the archetype that\u2019s emerged in recent weeks: While some Silicon Valley investors have come out in support of one presidential candidate or another (a growing number of them, like the founders of Andreessen Horowitz and some of Sequoia\u2019s own partners, are endorsing former President Donald Trump), Botha has doubled down on his neutrality. \u201cThere\u2019s no individual or party that perfectly expresses my opinions, so I just don\u2019t like the idea of so publicly lining up with anybody,\u201d Botha tells me in June. \u201cThat\u2019s just not who I am.\u201d\u00a0 But there\u2019s another reason Botha is staying out of the political fray. While individual Sequoia partners are free to endorse candidates and contribute to political campaigns, the firm itself does not take a position\u2014and it does not donate money to any candidates. As the firm\u2019s steward, Botha is well aware that he\u2019s not just representing himself with both his words and actions. \u201cWhat I say is probably more personally associated with Sequoia than it would be for somebody else,\u201d Botha says. \u201cI think me as an individual would have more freedom to speak differently if it was 10 years ago and I wasn\u2019t in a leadership position. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d To be sure, that sense of brand affiliation with the firm didn\u2019t stop Sequoia\u2019s former chiefs, Leone and Moritz, from expressing their own firmly-held beliefs when they were in charge. (And both still do.) But even then, Botha says it was done in the style of Sequoia\u2014ruthlessly honest, yes, but also practical.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMichael was a staunch Democratic, Doug was a staunch Republican,\u201d says Botha. \u201cMichael would write articles criticizing Trump, and Doug would publicly support him and donate money to him. And then the two of them would work on something. I think that\u2019s the culture we\u2019ve had.\u201d\u00a0 Botha\u2019s political neutrality doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not opinionated when it comes to regulatory decisions that impact Sequoia. In fact, the current administration\u2019s more aggressive stance on antitrust laws and scrutiny on Big Tech is part of what drives the new approach at the firm.\u00a0 Today, Botha says his biggest priority is keeping Sequoia involved throughout the life cycle of great companies\u2014getting in on very-early-stage deals and staying invested even as they grow past the startup stage. It\u2019s a huge competitive advantage, he asserts, to be able to partner with companies from concept to long after an IPO.\u00a0 One initiative with that aim, launched in 2022, is Arc, an \u201cimmersion program\u201d for early-stage startups. Entrepreneurs accepted into the five-week program are taught \u201cthe Sequoia way to start, build, and scale enduring companies.\u201d They\u2019re also given funding\u2014and the right to say they raised money from Sequoia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of folks who would probably say, \u2018Just don\u2019t do that, just go invest,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Jess Lee, a partner on Sequoia\u2019s early-stage team. But Botha, she says, \u201cis willing to both fund and invest and believe in those new ideas.\u201d Innovating is critical, says Botha, given the iffy landscape for startup exits. Historically, slightly more than half of Sequoia\u2019s exits have been through M&A. As regulators have moved to curb Big Tech, however, it has become difficult for companies to get acquired. This concerns Botha, who sees the overall health of the VC sector as vital to the broader economy. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find a single technology company that is a public company in the last 20 or 30 years that wasn\u2019t VC-backed along the way,\u201d he says. As for his own success, he\u2019s changed the metrics. It\u2019s no longer his own goals, or the \u201c10 to the power of 9\u201d number in the corner of his notebook: It\u2019s collective success that counts. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not personal winning now,\u201d says Botha. \u201cIt\u2019s the winning of us as a team.\u201d And a tight-knit team is invaluable\u2014because in venture capital, just like in rugby, another fiercely competitive scrum is always just around the corner. A version of this article appears in the August/September 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, \u201cSequoia is a VC giant. Can Roelof Botha keep it growing?\u201d "

        "body": "The red Lotus Esprit slips past the security gate, leaving behind the large, Spanish-style house and its sumptuous backyard pool. Vlad Tenev smiles as he grips the wooden-sphere stick shift and nudges the sports car into higher gear. Soon, the car is lapping up the oak-shaded curves of a Los Altos Hills back road as it winds toward the heart of Silicon Valley. The 1987 Lotus is a striking vehicle, with couch-like leather seats barely off the ground, and mini cigarette lighters and ashtrays on each armrest. The car\u2019s top speed is a modest 148\u00a0mph. It\u2019s an unusual ride for a billionaire who could easily spring for a garage full of McLarens and Bentleys, but it clearly delights Tenev. For the CEO of Robinhood, the Lotus is the fulfillment of a dream, held by many overgrown boys, of owning the car you drove in a childhood video game. It also embodies the values of unconventional design and rule-breaking that Tenev has sought to emulate at his company. Cars can be a metaphor for going fast, achieving independence\u2014or driving off a cliff. All of those feel appropriate for Tenev and the company he cofounded, which in barely a decade has worn very different identities, including feel-good startup and archvillain. Today, for the first time in a while, Robinhood\u2019s road is smooth and wide open. Love or hate Robinhood, there\u2019s no denying it has, more than any other company in recent memory, changed the way Americans invest. It popularized rash mass purchases of stocks like GameStop and Dogecoin, but also spurred the broader brokerage industry to copy its no-cost, mobile-first approach. Robinhood has grown fast: It had 24.1\u00a0million funded accounts at the end of May, up from 12.5\u00a0million in 2020, and its assets under custody have bulged to $135\u00a0billion. And it has transformed the demographics of investing, helping millions of people get a piece of the stock market for the first time. Robinhood has also changed Tenev. The 37-year-old first-generation American has weathered a series of crises, some self-inflicted, that Silicon Valley veterans say would have crushed most CEOs, emerging more canny and focused. Tenev is also just getting started. Not content for Robinhood to be a pretty, youth-focused stock-picking app, he is building a rival to Fidelity and Charles Schwab for the next half-century, aiming to serve a wider clientele while incorporating radical use of AI and blockchain technology. The Robinhood Tenev envisions will be a powerful personal-finance machine, designed for maturing users who are less and less likely to wipe out at high velocities.\u00a0 The Lotus eases into a parking spot in a humdrum office park. Clad in jeans, a black T-shirt, and coral-colored sandals, with a friendship bracelet made by his young daughter around his wrist, Tenev heads into work. Cars are still on his mind as he leads Black Widow, the internal name for a cross-team strategy meeting. The subject: a wide-ranging platform redesign with the goal of making Robinhood feel, in Tenev\u2019s words, \u201cmore serious.\u201d The team is discussing a new shade of yellow for one of the app\u2019s screens, and Tenev is not quite satisfied. \u201cI think it\u2019s better. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s iconic enough,\u201d he says, before embarking on a short monologue about the Lamborghini Countach, a 1970s sports car that upended the auto-design world by replacing friendly bubble shapes with sharp fins and a streamlined body. The discussion shifts to a technical issue as Tenev pushes the team to kill \u201cthe loader,\u201d an icon that Robinhood and other sites display to tell users a page will appear momentarily. Some on the team balk at the idea, saying it\u2019s not a viable option, but Tenev insists, with a friendly smile. But mostly the meeting is about colors. There is an animated 10-minute discussion on shades of green. A new swatch of yellows brings coos of delight. The team briefly contemplates changing the familiar green-is-up and red-is-down scheme for stock prices\u2014until someone points out the \u201ccognitive load\u201d that would come with challenging a learned behavior.\u00a0 The fixation with color and design is deeply ingrained at Robinhood. Edward Tufte\u2019s tome The Visual Display of Quantitative Information is an in-house bible. When asked what other companies they view as inspiration, executives don\u2019t mention brokerage or banking firms: Tesla and Apple are Robinhood\u2019s aesthetic North Stars. The design obsession came from Tenev\u2019s cofounder, Baiju Bhatt, who stepped down as co-CEO in 2020 and left the company in March to work on a soon-to-be-announced space startup. Still sporting a bushy black mane that falls past his shoulders\u2014Tenev has cut his own formerly flowing hair into a short, floppy mop\u2014Bhatt is described by everyone in his orbit as a product genius. He is also far more emotive than Tenev, who is laconic to an almost inhuman degree. \u201cOne of the high-water marks of product design is when you see something and use it for the first time and get a sense of who was behind it,\u201d says Bhatt, citing Apple as the paragon. \u201cI say that to differentiate from products that feel like they\u2019re designed by committee.\u201d Unlike other design-focused firms, though, Robinhood\u2019s objective is not to encourage a customer to buy a vehicle or a tablet but to induce a type of behavior: trading stocks. Like other app makers, Robinhood strives to ensure that every screen and every tap deliver a small spike of pleasure.\u00a0 All of this has made stock trading fast, easy, and pleasant like never before. But it has also resulted in Robinhood and its founders, at times, becoming objects of widespread distrust and even hatred. A 4\u00a0a.m. phone call rarely brings happy news, and the one on Jan.\u00a028, 2021, was no exception. The Robinhood team had tried to reach Tenev, but amid a spate of 20-hour days, his digital-hygiene regime involved his sleeping in one room with his phone in another. It was his wife, Celina, who got the call and woke her CEO husband.\u00a0 It was bad: A securities regulator had informed Robinhood it had to post $3\u00a0billion in collateral\u2014that day\u2014or else the company could be forced to shut down all trading.\u00a0 The demand was a black-swan event born of the depths of the pandemic when people, along with watching Tiger King and hoarding toilet paper, took to trading stocks in once-unimaginable volumes. These included legions of first-timers who poured billions into so-called meme stocks like GameStop and AMC. For most, Robinhood was the go-to platform. The problem: While the convenience of buying stock had improved dramatically by 2021, the country\u2019s financial plumbing had not. It still took 48 hours for a trade to clear, and brokerages had to serve as a backstop, ponying up cash while transactions worked their way through creaky clearinghouses. On most days, this wasn\u2019t a problem. But owing to a particularly feverish bout of meme-stock buying on Wednesday, Jan.\u00a027, the regulator wanted $3\u00a0billion.\u00a0 The size of the request was stunning. So, too, was Robinhood\u2019s response. By 4:30\u00a0a.m., Tenev had dragged out of bed his mentor Micky Malka, a venture capitalist famous for his fintech connections. Malka, Tenev, and other senior executives worked the phones incessantly to raise money, assuring investors that while Robinhood was facing a crisis, its underlying business was sound. Meanwhile, Robinhood barred customers from buying GameStop and a dozen other meme stocks, which reduced the amount of collateral it had to post. The blitz paid off. In an unprecedented feat, Robinhood scraped together over $1\u00a0billion that fateful Thursday, and by the weekend had over $3.4\u00a0billion of fresh capital in its coffers\u2014from investors who included Malka\u2019s Ribbit Capital, Sequoia, and Andreessen Horowitz. The success was the product of foresight. In 2020, after a calamitous 26-hour outage, Malka and Tenev had drafted a break-glass playbook for emergencies that might force the company to raise money in a hurry. According to Malka, the plan was modeled on a memorable episode from the 2008 financial crisis, when Goldman Sachs and Bank of America issued convertible notes to Warren Buffett in return for emergency cash. Still, this master class in nimbleness took a toll on the company\u2014and on the public image of its founders. In the space of months, popular perception of Tenev and Bhatt shifted from likable entrepreneurs to the epitome of self-serving tech-bro douchebags. A faction of critics already reviled them for peddling risky trading strategies\u2014particularly options\u2014to novices. Now, after the collateral call\u2014and the suspension of trading that went with it\u2014social media blazed with conspiracy theories that accused Tenev of colluding with hedge fund kings like Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin to sabotage GameStop and protect short-sellers. There is no evidence such a thing occurred, but the conspiracy became an article of faith on Reddit and in the internet\u2019s fever swamps. Online mobs targeted Robinhood execs with abuse, joined by smaller actual mobs who, on at least one occasion, struck the window of the company\u2019s offices with a bag of feces. The experience was frightening. As death threats mounted, the Tenevs fled their home, hiding out in a hotel and hiring a security detail. The situation proved especially traumatic for the more sensitive Bhatt, according to two Robinhood colleagues who recall his almost total physical and emotional withdrawal. Bhatt downplays that characterization, noting that he had already stepped down as co-CEO and was focusing on his newborn baby. Scott Sandell, chairman of venture capital firm NEA, recalls the events as an ordeal beyond what most corporate leaders ever face. \u201cIt was an extraordinary degree of pressure that I would posit very few can handle\u2014many standard deviations of pressure from the mean, aside from a war zone. Vlad was able to handle it. It wasn\u2019t good for Baiju, and it\u2019s not good for most people.\u201d Vitriol toward the founders even made its way to Hollywood. The 2023 film Dumb Money depicts retail investors prevailing in a David-and-Goliath battle against hedge fund billionaires\u2014villains who are in cahoots with the Robinhood founders. One scene depicts a wasted Tenev (played by Sebastian Stan) partying at an all-night rager with celebrity Robinhood customers, and boorishly hitting on a woman he mistakenly believes is flirting with him. The movie does a decent job capturing the broad strokes of the meme-stock mania; its depiction of Tenev is off the mark. He stopped drinking in 2017 in a gesture of solidarity with Celina, a fellow Stanford grad who had her own medical startup, as they awaited the birth of the first of their three children. Today, the couple\u2019s favorite indulgence is fancy coffee, and Tenev, far from being a bottles-and-models type, finds delight in chess, math problems, and his kids. Still, other elements of Dumb Money ring true, including a scene where Tenev glibly describes the founders\u2019 immigrant backgrounds to a journalist. The broad strokes of that backstory are accurate. Bhatt was born in Kansas and raised in Alabama and Virginia, the child of Indian parents; Tenev arrived in Delaware as a 5-year-old from Bulgaria, where his economist father had cajoled university librarians into lending books not authored by Marxists. Still, one former Robinhood executive feels the founders, whose affect is every inch American, trot out their immigrant past a little too frequently. The executive claims the tale is part of a broader, self-serving founding myth\u2014one in which Robinhood is an outgrowth of Occupy Wall Street, the socialist-style protest movement that arose in response to the 2009 financial crisis. \u201cIt was part of a narrative they concocted to add legitimacy to what was a brilliant business idea,\u201d says the source, adding that the founders dreamed up the Occupy angle with the help of VCs who told them their startup needed a story.\u00a0 The company disputes this interpretation. Regardless, there\u2019s little in the record to suggest the founders have ever been anything other than rabid capitalists. This is especially true of Bhatt, who, according to a recent book, liked to park his Porsche where he could look at it from his office window. Proxy filings show that Tenev and Bhatt hold roughly equal stakes that total 14% of Robinhood, worth around $2.7\u00a0billion as of mid-July. Malka, the VC, says he and Tenev bought tickets to see Dumb Money but changed their minds before showtime. As for Bhatt, he expresses indifference to how he and Robinhood are portrayed in the media. He does, though, grow animated about one element of the movie. \u201cI heard the dude that played me is wearing a wig. And this is all natural,\u201d he exclaims, tugging a fistful of his flowing mane. \u201cLet the people know: This is not a wig.\u201d Even after the angriest opprobrium faded, Robinhood\u2019s handling of the January 2021 crisis generated fodder for populist critics. As it turned out, Robinhood\u2019s ultrafast response meant that the company needed only $1\u00a0billion to satisfy the regulator\u2014but it raised an additional $2.4\u00a0billion anyway, in the spirit of letting no crisis go to waste. The extra fundraising provided insiders an opportunity to buy pre-IPO Robinhood stock at a 30% discount.\u00a0 This might have been fine if the IPO, in July 2021, had gone well. Instead, HOOD stock debuted at $38, promptly fell 10% on opening day\u2014and bottomed out at $6.81 a year later. This came as an especially bitter pill for the many Robinhood customers who bought shares at the open. For Tenev, the period was a bleak one. In addition to contempt from analysts and former fans, Tenev had to endure another indignity from crypto grifter Sam Bankman-Fried, who bought 7% of Robinhood\u2019s shares in early 2022 and let it be known he wanted to shake up the company. Reluctantly, Tenev invited Bankman-Fried to his home. The pair sat in the backyard, where the FTX founder laid out his plans. \u201cHe was very formal about it, surprisingly,\u201d Tenev recalls. \u201cAnd he was just like, \u2018Well, there\u2019s things that we could do together, you know, derivatives, European trading\u2014can you integrate Alameda as a counterparty?\u2019\u2009\u201d (Alameda was the personal hedge fund Bankman-Fried used to loot FTX customer money.) Tenev demurred, and the discussions petered out. Following Bankman-Fried\u2019s arrest in late 2022, Robinhood reacquired his shares; Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year fraud sentence. This period also coincided with a series of putrid earnings results and layoffs, leaving Tenev in a state he had not felt since starting the company: unhappy. Ever the pragmatist, he responded by making a list of steps to turn Robinhood around, including cleaning house of \u201cmercenary\u201d employees whose motive for joining had been to get a piece of the IPO.\u00a0 The process also included a brutal ritual of self-criticism, in the form of quarterly meetings that envisioned Tenev getting fired by the board. \u201cSay they brought in a really, really good CEO\u2014like, the archetype of the best CEO on the planet,\u201d Tenev recalls. The team imagined that CEO saying: \u201cLet\u2019s just, like, redo everything that asshole before me did, and clean up the mess. It\u2019s a useful exercise.\u201d Needless to say, Tenev wasn\u2019t ousted. (Together, he and Bhatt hold more than 60% of Robinhood\u2019s voting shares.) And the company has gradually pulled itself out of the doldrums. Robinhood was profitable for the 12 months through March\u00a031\u2014a new milestone. And its share price, while still far off its IPO peak, has more than trebled from its $7 low point.\u00a0 Still, Tenev\u2019s work is far from finished, and he faces two major challenges: He must persuade investors that Robinhood can grow into a big-league operation, and he must convince the public that he and his company are more than the shallow caricatures reflected in Dumb Money. It was little more than a generation ago that stock traders were overwhelmingly middle- and upper-class men who paid $10 or $20 to make trades by phone with their brokers. The internet began to change that, as platforms like E*Trade lowered the financial and cultural barriers to buying stock. Still, it took Robinhood to throw the doors wide open. The company introduced no-commission trading in 2013, eventually forcing the industry to follow suit, thanks to an app that eschewed the industry\u2019s middle-aged-white-guy vibe.\u00a0 The U.S. stock market is the biggest generator of wealth in history, and it matters a lot that Robinhood has helped millions of once-excluded Americans get a piece of it. Robinhood says the median age of its customers is 34, compared to 58 for industry incumbents, and that its user base is far more diverse. A recent survey paid for by Robinhood found that Black and Hispanic customers respectively accounted for 4% and 8% of incumbent brokerages\u2019 users; for Robinhood, those numbers were 14% and 16%. Meanwhile, the company has tailored offerings to customer segments long ignored by the industry. For instance, Robinhood offers a 1% to 3% IRA match to workers at some gig economy companies, including TaskRabbit and Grubhub.\u00a0 30% 32% \u201cMost families first access the stock market when a family member receives stocks as part of employment compensation, and historically that didn\u2019t include women or people of color,\u201d says Sergio Ricci, who has authored a paper with fellow law professor Christina Sautter that argues services like Robinhood lower barriers to amassing wealth. There is no guarantee, of course, that entering the market will pay off, as demonstrated by the many first-time investors who lost big\u2014often while using Robinhood\u2014in recent meme-stock and crypto-token bubbles. Critically, though, there\u2019s evidence that those traders are hardly the majority. Studies by Vanda Research, which focuses on retail investors\u2019 behavior, have found that among those novices who\u2019ve stuck around, acumen has improved over time. Since early 2021, these investors have been less inclined to chase meme-lord trends, and more likely to opt for more stable big-name stocks or index funds. \u201cBy losing capital, a lot of retail investors learned a lesson,\u201d says Vanda VP Marco Iachini.\u00a0 The upshot is that a large cohort of young investors appear committed to the long haul\u2014and many millions of them are Robinhood\u2019s customers. The question is whether Tenev and his team can build a business around them that could rival giants like Fidelity and Charles Schwab. There are substantial reasons for doubt. One is that the average Robinhood account balance has stubbornly remained stuck near $5,000. This reinforces a perception that many customers use Robinhood as a play account, keeping most of their money at more established firms\u2014and that newer customers could do the same as they become more affluent. Robinhood CFO Jason Warnick says he is keenly aware of the potential for flight, which he calls \u201cgraduation risk.\u201d The company\u2019s response has been to emulate Amazon\u2014where Warnick worked for two decades\u2014by adding layer after layer of offerings so customers don\u2019t want to leave.\u00a0 In the past 18 months, Robinhood has made big strides on this front, rolling out a retirement-account offering and its first credit card. In both cases, it offered major inducements to sign up: a 3% match on IRA transfers for members of Robinhood\u2019s premium $5 per month Gold tier (and a 1% match for others) and credit card travel and rewards perks that rival industry leaders. Warnick says the incentives are designed to ensure that both products turn a profit, sooner rather than later. All of this will help mitigate the historical weakness of Robinhood\u2019s strategy: an overreliance on trading, which brings a bounty when the market is up but hard times when it cools. Robinhood generates much of its revenue by routing batches of transactions to market makers, a practice called payment for order flow, or PFOF. But when trading volumes decline, that spigot also dries up. Matt Harris, a fintech investor at Bain Capital Ventures, notes that there\u2019s a significant gap between the \u201cadrenaline-driven frequent trading strategies\u201d in Robinhood\u2019s DNA and the wealth-management model that drives revenue at a Fidelity or Schwab. The latter model is more lucrative but also entails fiduciary obligations to put customers\u2019 financial interests first\u2014which means more red tape and expense. Still, Harris doesn\u2019t rule out Robinhood making the transition: \u201cSometimes the pirates become the navy,\u201d he notes. He adds that the company has an ace up its sleeve: Unlike most financial companies, it owns its tech stack \u201csoup to nuts,\u201d making it less dependent on partners and better positioned to make profits.\u00a0 Ultimately, though, Robinhood\u2019s future rides with Tenev\u2014now battle-tested and in his late thirties, the age when other famous entrepreneurs have hit their peak. Speaking with Tenev, one senses he has only begun to flex his ambitions. He believes that two technologies\u2014crypto and AI\u2014will reshape the financial world, and he is laying plans for both. Robinhood recently bought one of Europe\u2019s longest-established Bitcoin exchanges\u2014a move that will expand its overseas reach and give it a beachhead to develop an institutional crypto business. More radically, Tenev predicts that blockchains and the conduits of traditional finance will become fused, enabling companies adept at both to become leaders. As for artificial intelligence, Tenev\u2014who recently led a funding round in a startup focused on improving AI\u2019s math skills\u2014sees a huge opportunity in wealth advising. Right now, he says, the business is bare-bones and overpriced for ordinary investors, while richer clients overpay for glorified concierge service. Tenev predicts his company will be on the vanguard of a world where customers get affordable wealth-management guidance from an AI advisor with deep knowledge of their financial lives, backed up by a human touch when necessary. Pulling this off would make Robinhood not only a financial giant, but also a design and engineering pioneer. For Tenev, the founder who rhapsodizes over the paradigm-busting achievements of the Lotus and Countach, it would be the equivalent of popularizing the flying car. And it could make Tenev and Robinhood truly iconic.\u2002 A version of this article appears in the August/September 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, \u201cHow big can Robinhood really get?\u201d "

        "body": "Every day, you\u2019re paying a tax that Congress never voted on, a tax that\u2019s growing rapidly heavier. Yet you may not even know when you\u2019re paying this tax because it goes by another name: tariffs. It is baked into the prices of products, from sneakers to semiconductors to compression springs, that are manufactured abroad or that use imported components or materials\u2014that is, a large portion of the things Americans buy. As the presidential election approaches, all signs point to higher tariffs on American imports\u2014no matter who wins. (While Vice President Kamala Harris was the clear favorite to be the Democratic nominee as this article went to press, it\u2019s safe to say that any potential rival would have a similar trade agenda.) The consequences will reach far beyond those ballooning hidden taxes that Americans pay. They will also influence global geopolitics and touch every business and consumer in the U.S., plus billions more worldwide. The trend is still hard to believe, for those who have been following the issue. After decades of working for freer trade worldwide, the U.S. has reversed course, with both parties on board. The two sides don\u2019t offer identical trade proposals\u2014Donald Trump\u2019s would be much more severe\u2014but broadly speaking, this is a rare issue on which both sides of the aisle are aligned. Both parties are pursuing this agenda to assert their commitment to protecting American industry and jobs from overseas competition\u2014but business mostly doesn\u2019t like it, especially companies selling consumer goods to price-sensitive customers already wary of inflation. \u201cUnfortunately, there does seem to be this movement within both parties to turn insular and turn away from trade in ways that will be economically damaging,\u201d says Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey\u2019re going to end up hurting average Americans.\u201d Tariff proponents, in making their case, often cloud how they work. Tariffs require U.S. importers of foreign goods and services to pay duties to the U.S. Treasury, based on what was imported. Research over decades finds that importers pass the extra cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices\u2014or they are forced to cut costs or accept lower profits.\u00a0 This simple fact tends to be missing from the populist rhetoric: The exporting country does not pay the tariff. The importing company does. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign boasts that as president, Trump \u201cimposed tariffs on China that brought billions of dollars into the federal Treasury\u201d\u2014failing to note that it was American consumers and companies who paid those billions. Joe Biden\u2019s White House said often that tariffs he imposed \u201cprotect American workers and businesses,\u201d without mentioning that those tariffs have also hurt many workers and businesses. David French, the National Retail Federation\u2019s top government relations executive, tells Fortune, \u201cOur hope is the next administration will move into a more comprehensive nontariff trade barrier discussion that includes multilateral negotiations. We\u2019d love to be writing trade deals again.\u201d He\u2019s likely to be disappointed. As the campaigning heats up, Democrats will likely stand on Biden\u2019s record of imposing tariffs, pointing proudly to steeply increased tariffs on Chinese steel, aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, solar cells, and more.\u00a0 Trump goes much further, proposing a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports and a universal 10% tariff on imports from all countries\u2014radically high and broad tariffs not seen in the U.S. since World War\u00a0II. Goldman Sachs calculates Trump\u2019s program would raise inflation by 1.1\u00a0percentage points and reduce GDP growth by a half point, a significant drop when GDP has most recently been growing at an annual rate of only 1.4%. Trump\u2019s tariffs would cost a middle-income household $1,700 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u00a0 News that the U.S. is enthusiastically cranking up tariffs under both parties would have sounded otherworldly for most of the past 75 years. For the first portion of U.S. history, the bulk of the federal government\u2019s revenue\u2014in some years nearly 100%\u2014came from tariffs. The country began to trim its reliance on tariffs after a 1913 constitutional amendment allowed income tax. Then, at the end of World War\u00a0II, 28 countries banded together to negotiate agreements that would reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, reasoning that lowering these barriers to free trade would leave all the participating countries better off. That group\u2019s successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), today has 164 member countries, whose progress over the decades has been dramatic. In 1948, the U.S. collected duties that were 14% of the value of all tariffed imports and 6% of total imports. By 2017, the respective tariff rates had plunged to 5% and 1%. Then everything changed. In 2018, President Trump\u2014who had famously tweeted that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win\u201d\u2014followed through by launching a grand-scale trade war. He imposed a slew of tariffs that eventually covered Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Mexico, and South Korea. Most of those countries quickly launched retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.\u2014which in turn hurt American manufacturers\u2019 ability to compete in those growing overseas markets. Result of the trade war: a draw at best. U.S. imports fell, but so did exports because of the retaliation, according to an extensive analysis, The Return to Protectionism, by researchers at several universities. (The pandemic did not distort the results, which were published in February 2020.) The authors found that U.S. consumers and firms that bought imports lost $52\u00a0billion. And, the researchers observed, the tariffs appeared to be intensely political: Industries that were protected by U.S. tariffs were concentrated in electorally competitive counties.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t sound like a policy triumph, or even a political one for Trump: Foreign retaliatory tariffs disproportionately hit industries in Republican counties, and of course Trump lost his bid for reelection. Yet while President Biden changed many of Trump\u2019s policies, he barely touched Trump\u2019s tariffs, keeping nearly all of those he inherited and adding many more, mostly targeting China.\u00a0 \u201cDuring the first couple years of this presidency, with the challenge of inflation, there was every incentive to think about ways to reduce inflationary pressure, including the reduction of tariffs\u2014yet it appears that keeping the tariffs against China was a higher priority,\u201d says Theodore Bunzel, head of Lazard Geopolitical Advisory at the Lazard financial advisory and asset management firm. \u201cThat is striking in terms of the sea change it represents.\u201d\u00a0 Put simply: U.S. protectionism, which reached its apex in the Great Depression and was nearly extinct by 2017, has been growing again, with bipartisan support. Meanwhile, beyond tariffs, the geopolitical forces that prompted today\u2019s trade wars, prominently including the U.S.\u2013China rivalry, have elevated business\u2019s role in policy. \u201cCEOs today have a new job in Washington,\u201d says Klaus Kleinfeld, who dealt with trade policy when he was CEO of Alcoa and Arconic. \u201cIt\u2019s broader than tariffs.\u201d Companies and technology have become crucial players in international relations. \u201cCorporations have increasingly become both the objects and instruments of foreign policy,\u201d wrote Lazard\u2019s Bunzel, Jami Miscik, and Peter Orszag in a recent article in Foreign Affairs. Examples are everywhere. Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite-based internet service plays a vital role in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine. The U.S. forbids Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips for AI to China. The CHIPS and Science Act subsidizes semiconductor makers\u2014American (such as Intel) and foreign (such as Taiwan\u2019s TSMC and South Korea\u2019s Samsung)\u2014to build factories in the U.S. Or consider Microsoft\u2019s April announcement that it was investing $1.5\u00a0billion in G42, an AI company based in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. The announcement didn\u2019t mention a critical element of the deal: that G42 would get rid of all its Chinese equipment, including that made by Huawei, the giant Chinese tech company that the U.S. considers a national security threat.\u00a0 Business may have to face starkly different government priorities and geopolitical realities depending on who wins the election, with Democrats likely to follow Biden\u2019s lead on these issues. Biden embraced America\u2019s alliances, notably NATO, while Trump has disdained them, even threatening to take the U.S. out of NATO. Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201ca killer,\u201d while Trump has often praised him. Biden refused to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without preconditions, while Trump met with Kim three times, saying they \u201cfell in love.\u201d\u00a0 Businesspeople like to say they can play to win if they know the rules. What they hate is when the rules keep changing. The outlook: With both political parties eager to reshape U.S. engagement in the global economy, wise business leaders will be checking the rules every morning. Whatever comes next, here\u2019s how U.S. companies can prepare.Bring in dedicated policy expertise.\u00a0Says Theodore Bunzel of Lazard: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more companies designating a chief policy officer or chief geopolitical officer.\u201d Do realistic\u00a0scenario planning.What would your business do if a conflict\u2014think Gaza or Ukraine\u2014suddenly escalates? What if a major U.S. ally shifts its majority party in a national election, as the U.K. and France did recently? Apply such scenarios to an internal stress test: How would your business fare?\u00a0 Accept that lobbying doesn\u2019t work as it used to.\u00a0Pleas to Uncle Sam for protection based on national security will be received more favorably than traditional arguments based on economics.\u00a0 Run the numbers.\u00a0How would Trump\u2019s proposed 60% tariff on\u00a0all imports from China\u00a0and his universal 10% tariff affect your company and industry? What retaliatory responses seem likely? Consider adjusting your company strategy based on your findings. Where the Democrats and\u00a0Republicans stand on other\u00a0issues business cares about.TaxesThe future of the wide-ranging 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, is the big question. Trump, who signed it into law, wants to extend it. Democrats want to let it expire. Among the many changes for business if the law expires:\u2013Taxes on noncorporate businesses, like sole proprietorships, would rise.\u2013The corporate tax rate could rise from 21%, but exactly how much would be determined by Congress. The pre-TCJA rate was 35%.\u2013Companies would no longer be allowed to deduct the full cost of capital investments in the year spent, and instead would have to amortize the cost over a period of years.\u00a0 RegulationTrump would roll back regulation, much as he did in 2017. The Democratic nominee would likely continue Biden\u2019s regulation of companies\u2019 actions affecting the environment, energy, finance, and mergers.\u00a0 ImmigrationThe Democratic Party platform will emphasize securing the southern border, consistent with Biden\u2019s recent toughened stance\u2014increasing deportations and denying asylum to migrants who cross unlawfully. Trump has promised the \u201clargest deportation operation\u201d in U.S. history.\u00a0 LaborThe Democratic Party will strongly support labor unions. Trump has been courting union members, but as president he was not labor-friendly: The AFL-CIO called his record \u201ccatastrophic and devastating.\u201d Targeted countries will retaliate.\u00a0They always do, and have done so over the past six years. China, for example, retaliated against Trump\u2019s tariffs by imposing tariffs on U.S. agriculture products that China imports from several states. Those farm states may not have many people, but each has two senators who weren\u2019t happy. Trump learned that lesson and now promises to retaliate against the retaliators by enacting the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, which he recently explained to a Wisconsin audience thus: \u201cReciprocal trade\u2014that\u2019s you screw us, we screw you.\u201d Such tit-for-tat tariffs can escalate quickly. Foreign companies will find work-arounds.Shein, a fast-growing fast-fashion Chinese retailer selling globally, uses a curious business model. Rather than shipping merchandise to the U.S. in large, economical containers for distribution to customers from U.S. warehouses, it mails U.S. customers\u2019 individual purchases direct from China. One reason: Packages valued at less than $800 are exempt from U.S. tariffs. A congressional report says the American retailer Gap\u00a0Inc. paid $700\u00a0million in import duties in 2022 while Shein paid nothing\u2014being the exporter, not the importer\u2014and the situation didn\u2019t help the American company compete with the Chinese one. While Gap\u00a0Inc. likely passed along the cost of its tariffs to customers, driving up its prices, it\u2019s hard to imagine many of Shein\u2019s U.S. customers bought $800 worth of $7 sweatshirts and $1 earrings and had to pay duties.\u00a0 As protectionism expands, it will become\u00a0complex and tangled.The appliance maker Whirlpool\u2019s experience is cautionary. One of Trump\u2019s first trade actions was to impose steep tariffs on imported large residential washing machines. \u201cIt was a moment-in-time solution that allowed us to regain our competitive footing,\u201d says Whirlpool general counsel Kyle De\u00a0Jong. \u201cEighty percent of what we sell in the U.S., we make in the U.S.\u201d But those measures expired in 2023, and now U.S. tariffs are working against Whirlpool. The company must pay tariffs on some component parts that are available only in China, but when those same components arrive in the U.S. inside Asian-made washers, they aren\u2019t separately tariffed. In addition, Whirlpool uses American-made steel to ensure a localized supply chain while avoiding tariffed imported Chinese steel. But De\u00a0Jong points out that the company\u2019s foreign competitors can use that cheaper Chinese metal in their products. \u201cThat\u2019s the competitive dynamic we\u2019re concerned about,\u201d he says, \u201cthe unintended consequences for American manufacturing.\u201d Hurried tariffs may be the worst tariffs of all.James Wallar, a retired Treasury official and trade expert, argues in a recent article that the Trump and Biden administrations opted \u201cfor speed and optics rather than careful analysis following international rules.\u201d Imposing tariffs on one country, as Trump and Biden have mostly done, is fast and easy for constituents and voters to understand. But significant change generally comes via multilateral negotiations, not piecemeal actions against individual countries. Wallar says the Biden administration undermined its own international profile and ability to exert pressure on other countries. Its quick and narrow tariffs on China \u201cmight look tough domestically\u2014protection and tariffs are politically popular among voters,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it has diminished U.S. global leadership on trade policy and its effectiveness in promoting permanent change.\u201d\u2002 Additional reporting by Alena BotrosA version of this article appears in the August/September 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, \u201cWhat can business expect from the next president?\u201d "

        "body": "A popular adage about leaders says the most effective of them build self-sufficient organizations. If the conductor leaves, the orchestra plays on. But let\u2019s be honest: That\u2019s not true for many of today\u2019s most influential leaders, in business or politics. Instead, as this year\u2019s run-up to the U.S. election has made plain, we often elevate leaders who believe they\u2019re irreplaceable. Without me, the entire enterprise disintegrates, these leaders seem to think. The music stops. Now Americans are watching in real time the problems this can cause. Less than a month before the start of the Democratic National Convention, the 81-year-old sitting president, Joe Biden, has capitulated to demands from within his party that he stand down from his campaign for a second term and make way for a younger candidate. His decision has won praise, although some say, as Frank Bruni put it in the New York Times, that it came \u201cweeks later than it should have, after too much secrecy, too much arrogance, too much denial.\u201d At the time of writing, the Democrats are scrambling to build a process for finding a new nominee. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, and she is seen as the frontrunner after several powerful Democrats\u2014but not all\u2014quickly backed her.\u00a0\u00a0 The Democrats may still pull off a successful transition to a new candidate, but no one would say it has been a smooth process so far. And Biden\u2019s critics say his administration has failed to give Harris opportunities to demonstrate her ability to lead (a complaint that could be made about previous administrations, too). Having an emergency line-of-succession plan is not the same as building up the party\u2019s next presidential contender.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Republicans remain solidly united behind their 78-year-old candidate. Even those who once rejected Donald Trump\u2019s policies and antagonistic tone have endorsed him. As the nominee\u2019s daughter-in-law and Republican National Committee leader Lara Trump said, \u201cEvery single penny will go to the number one and the only job of the RNC: that is, electing Donald J. Trump as president of the United States and saving this country.\u201d But the RNC\u2019s total focus on one man\u2014who is mortal, as the recent attempt on his life horrifyingly underlined\u2014may prove precarious for the party. This tumultuous month has shown that neither party has anything close to a playbook for replacing its torchbearer. It\u2019s a moment when political operatives on both sides of the aisle might admit that they need a new model for succession. For that, they could look to the business world, and to corporate boards, where succession planning is an obsession.\u00a0 To be sure, everyone can name a few companies where such plans haven\u2019t panned out (see Disney and Starbucks). Still, companies at least have a structure\u2014the board\u2014to ensure that someone is scouting for tomorrow\u2019s leaders, looking several layers into an organization or outside the company to find potential talent. Indeed, many company directors will tell you this is their main raison d\u2019\u00eatre, says Paroon Chadha, cofounder and CEO of OnBoard, a governance software company. In a recent poll of 6,000 boards, his company found that two-thirds said succession planning was their top priority.\u00a0 Ted Dintersmith, a former venture capital investor and top Democratic Party donor, believes it\u2019s time to bring some semblance of corporate-style governance to politics, to help protect U.S. democracy: \u201cThe political system needs to put itself on pause and say, \u2018How can we embrace the principles that have made America\u2019s economy so strong?\u2019\u2009\u201d Having served on more than 50 boards in his career, he points out that directors are meant to check a CEO\u2019s power and to deter and respond to unprofessional behavior. By comparison, Dintersmith adds, the leaders of political parties are rarely challenged by insiders. While each has aides and advisors, they are subordinate to their bosses and aren\u2019t beholden to any broader constituency.\u00a0 In a corporate setting, a board would likely have considered both Biden and Trump to be bad bets as leaders, he argues. Biden\u2019s advanced age would put him in jeopardy, and Trump, who was found liable in a sexual abuse lawsuit, would never survive a decent board\u2019s sniff test.\u00a0\u00a0 Corporate-style governance doesn\u2019t always ensure a smooth succession process. Succession planning can get pushed off the agenda by more pressing matters, says Chadha, and it takes discipline to keep returning to a problem that doesn\u2019t require an immediate solution.\u00a0 But that advance work to find and groom a potential replacement can pay off massively when a successor is needed, following either a leader\u2019s planned departure or an unplanned one. Another common roadblock to replacing a CEO: It\u2019s not easy to tell a powerful person that it\u2019s time to let go, to find a new identity, and to watch someone else do their old job. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive topic for the incumbent,\u201d Chadha says. This human problem is familiar to anyone who has been part of an agonizing discussion about an older person\u2019s fitness\u2014whether that person is a president, a business leader, or even a parent. And again, corporate boards have developed strategies to manage such moments.\u00a0 Some set age limits for CEOs, making some transitions automatic. Many companies use the board-chair role as a soft landing for departing CEOs\u2014allowing an important person to exert influence while making space for someone else to lead.\u00a0 A similar kind of position could be created for departing presidents: a White House advisor, perhaps, or a high-level role at a party\u2019s national committee. Given his 36 years in Congress and 12 years in two White House administrations, Biden could remain a guiding force in his party.\u00a0\u00a0 The Dutch management theorist Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries urges companies to create \u201cbeautiful exits\u201d when it\u2019s time for someone to leave. Longtime leaders may need coaching to envision that exit for themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for human beings to accept their own disintegration, so we go into all different kinds of defensive maneuvers,\u201d he once told me\u2014including clinging to power and to work.\u00a0 As of this writing, it\u2019s looking like Harris is poised to be Biden\u2019s de facto successor, though other candidates may come forward. Dintersmith, who was among the donors who had been calling for Biden to leave the race and for the party to select a new nominee, says a competitive nominating process would be the smarter path, one that would more closely resemble corporate governance procedures. \u201cIf the CEO decides to step down, they would say to the board, \u2018I think my chief operating officer would be perfect for this, and I hope you give them every consideration,\u2019\u2009\u201d he explains. \u201cThey\u2019d also say, \u2018But I know you\u2019re going to do your job and look at a full range of candidates before you make this choice.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u00a0 A strong, competitive process benefits the organization and the successor no matter who is chosen, Dintersmith says.\u00a0 Granted, time is short for the Democrats, but that can also be the case when a struggling firm needs a turnaround CEO. \u201cThe board might say: \u2018With our reservoir of experience, it\u2019s crystal clear this other person is perfect,\u2019\u2009\u201d Dintersmith says. \u201cOr they might say, \u2018Let\u2019s do a search.\u2019\u2009\u201d Finally, corporate boards wouldn\u2019t see the party convention or even the election in November as the end of their process. When a new CEO takes over, boards immediately put together a succession plan for the next leadership change\u2014to be reviewed periodically and adjusted as needed. That\u2019s a task that both parties ought to take seriously come Nov. 5.\u2002 \u00a0A version of this article appears in the August/September 2024 issue of Fortune, with the headline, \u201cWhat American politics can learn about succession planning from American corporations.\u201d  "

        "body": "Nvidia and the rest of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks dominated the markets during the first half of the year, leaving many investors to wonder how they can tweak their portfolio to best take advantage of the historic runs. But a longtime investing expert is encouraging investors to tune out the noise and focus on the fundamentals. Burton Malkiel, author of the bestselling investing book\u00a0A Random Walk Down Wall Street, tells Fortune that trying to get in on individual AI stocks now could be a big mistake for the average investor. Just look at the shakiness of the markets over the past few weeks. \u201cThere is such clear evidence by looking at individual investors, you see the ones who traded the most are the ones who lost the most money,\u201d says Malkiel, who is now Wealthfront\u2019s chief investment officer. \u201cNobody can time the market, don\u2019t try to do it. And if you do, you are much more likely to get it wrong than get it right.\u201d In a letter to Wealthfront investors released Tuesday, Malkiel reminds readers that trying to pick a sector of the stock market that will outperform the rest is akin to trying to time the market: a losing prospect. The best practices for building wealth via investing remain the basics, including \u201cbroad\u00a0diversification, indexing, minimizing costs and\u00a0taxes, rebalancing, and staying the course.\u201d \u201cEqually important is to avoid the common mistakes that have crushed even the best-laid investment plans,\u201d he writes.\u00a0\u201cAmong the worst mistakes is to get swept up in either extreme euphoria or in waves of unrelenting pessimism,\u00a0both when it comes to the market as a whole and the performance of specific sectors.\u201d Malkiel notes that the best way to actually earn a decent rate of return from investing in the broader market is by buying and holding for long periods of time\u2014not jumping in and out of the hot sector of the moment. Timing rarely works out long term; in fact, research has shown that many investors miss out on many of the best days of the market when they try to time their investments, preventing them from realizing the biggest gains. Investors are much more likely to sell at the bottom and buy at the top than the reverse. He uses the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) to exemplify that trend. The fund went from selling for around $50 a share in 2020 to over $130 a share in early 2021, after interest in artificial intelligence companies took off. Investors started \u201cpouring several billion dollars per month into the fund,\u201d Malkiel writes, when prices were at their peak. The enthusiasm eventually subsided, and ARKK\u2019s price fell back to around\u00a0$47 a share by April 2022; investors withdrew their money, leading to major losses. \u201cAs the ARKK example demonstrates, even when investors correctly pick a high-performing sector, timing errors can lead to negative returns,\u201d he writes. Instead of trying to get in on the buzziest stocks, Malkiel encourages investors to stick with dollar-cost averaging, or consistently investing money each month regardless of what the market is doing. With this strategy, over time, the highs and lows more or less even out. In that regard, index funds are still king. And a broad-based fund solves the problem of picking sectors as well, because they give meaningful exposure to the sectors producing the best returns.   \u201cThe beauty of owning a broad index is that you\u2019re likely to get exposure to that AI winner in your portfolio anyway,\u201d he writes. Rather than trying to pick stocks, Malkiel encourages investors to focus on what they can control, including the cost of their investments. Keep fund fees and taxes minimal, and that will have more of a positive effect long-term on their performance. \u201cThe long-run way to build wealth is to just keep on going,\u201d he says."

        "body": "Everyone seems to be looking for the magic bullet when it comes to investing. Index funds are boring, so surely there\u2019s more upside to be found in AI or small-caps or some other yet-to-be-discovered opportunity that will yield unprecedented returns. Right? Not according to Burt Malkiel. The author of the bestselling investing bible A Random Walk Down Wall Street says trying to find a work-around for index funds is one of the biggest mistakes the average investor makes. Even those who do it professionally tend to underperform the broader market. That being bullish on index funds is considered an unusual proposition may seem surprising. But much has been made lately about the so-called narrowing of index funds, or the fact that the Magnificent Seven tech stocks\u2014Alphabet,\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Apple,\u00a0Meta,\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0Nvidia,\u00a0and Tesla\u2014account for around 20% of the S&P 500\u2019s total value and make up much of the gains for the year. But Malkiel, who is Wealthfront\u2019s chief investment officer, says the low-cost funds are still the best bet for most investors. Rather than getting caught up in sector selection or trying to read the tea leaves on which artificial intelligence company will one day rule them all, stick with the basics, he says. \u201cInvesting is very simple,\u201d Malkiel tells Fortune. \u201cTo the extent that their income is stocks, the main asset they should be holding is a broad-based index fund.\u201d  Here are three other mistakes he warns everyday investors to avoid. Okay, this is an obvious one. Still, research shows that time and again, investors pile money in when markets are riding high, and pull out when they are sinking. That\u2019s the exact opposite of the ideal investment strategy.  Of course, it\u2019s almost impossible for even professional investors to consistently time the market effectively (by buying low and selling high). So Malkiel and pretty much every other investing expert recommends a strategy called dollar-cost averaging, meaning consistently investing money each month regardless of what the market is doing. In this strategy, investors buy regardless of what the market is doing; over time, the highs and lows more or less even out. \u201cPutting a little money from each paycheck into an investment program, not getting scared when there is a financial crisis or there\u2019s some international event that terrifies you, just keep on doing it\u2014that has such benefits,\u201d he says. \u201cThe long-run way to build wealth is to just keep on going.\u201d If you have a retirement account at work (and don\u2019t stop your contributions when the market gets shaky), then you\u2019re already dollar-cost averaging. But it\u2019s a good strategy regardless of the investing account you\u2019re using. Another big mistake: not making efficient use of tax-advantaged investment accounts. There are two main types that the average investor deals with when it comes to retirement savings: tax-deferred accounts, like a 401(k) and IRA, and post-tax accounts, like a Roth IRA (or Roth 401(k) in some circumstances). A tax-deferred account lets investors contribute pretax income, giving them a benefit now. When they withdraw money in retirement, they pay taxes then. On the flip side, investors contribute money that has already been taxed to a Roth IRA. When distributions are taken in retirement, the growth is not taxed again. Malkiel is especially bullish on Roth IRAs, particularly for younger investors. \u201cThis is a way of having your returns compound without tax,\u201d he says. \u201cNot taking advantage of some of these tax-advantaged retirement plans, I would say that\u2019s an even bigger mistake than thinking you\u2019re so smart that you can time the market.\u201d The good news is that many young people are already investing money via Roth IRAs. In fact, the percentage of households headed by a twentysomething investing in a Roth almost tripled from 2016 to 2022, according to\u00a0data from the U.S. Federal Reserve\u00a0analyzed by Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research (CRR).  Finally, Malkiel says the biggest mistake is not investing at all. While he understands that many Americans are juggling countless financial priorities, he hopes more people will start to see the benefit of investing money for retirement sooner rather than later. Malkiel references the oft-maligned Starbucks coffee as an example of where people might find the money. No, he\u2019s not saying to skip it completely\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not down on Starbucks, I go there myself,\u201d he says\u2014but he is saying making substitutions a few days a week (whether for coffee to go or some other common expenditure) can make a difference. Think of it this way, he says: a $10 breakfast could become $50 down the line thanks to compounding returns. Malkiel isn\u2019t advocating for never having a little treat, but he is saying everyone has to make some kind of sacrifice for a larger future gain. You can have anything, but not everything. \u201cA dollar today means several dollars less in retirement,\u201d he says.  And spending $10 a day on a cup of mediocre coffee and a croissant could also mean losing out on $20 immediately, if you have a workplace 401(k) match that you\u2019ve been neglecting. That\u2019s the loss of a 100% return."

        "author": "Alicia Adamczyk",
        "body": "Though her birth in October 1964 technically makes her a baby boomer, Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, was born on the cusp of Gen X, just a few months before from the start of the generation which is typically defined as including those born between 1965 and 1980. Around two decades younger than both President Joe Biden and Republican nominee Donald Trump, she represents a clear generational shift in politics, and is being embraced by Gen Xers who have never had representation in the Oval Office before. Her and husband Doug Emhoff\u2019s finances, revealed in disclosure forms released by the White House over the past few years, are reflective of their position on the tail end of the baby boom. Take their retirement savings: Harris has a pension via her work for the government; as one of the youngest baby boomers, this isn\u2019t an anomaly. That said, Harris\u2019s age puts her smack in the middle of when the first modern workers moved away from guaranteed pensions to fund their retirements and toward defined contribution plans like 401(k)s and IRAs. Gen X is the first generation to largely bear the full brunt of saving on their own (some experts call them the \u201c401(k) experiment\u201d generation), and the shift hasn\u2019t worked out terribly well for them: A recent study that looked at young boomers born between 1959 and 1964 found that 52% have total assets of less than $250,000. According to her financial disclosure forms, the vice president and Emhoff\u2014who was also born in October 1964\u2014are in a substantially better position. The couple\u2019s net worth is between $3.6 million and around $7.40 million, excluding real estate, according to an analysis from the Wall Street Journal. Most of Harris\u2019s assets are held in retirement accounts that are invested in index funds; she and her husband also hold at least $850,000 but potentially closer to $2 million in cash (the financial disclosure forms reveal a range of assets, not an exact amount). Harris and her husband are also homeowners, which is common among Gen Xers (72% own a home). They have a 2.625% mortgage rate, according to their financial disclosure forms, which is well below the generation\u2019s average 4% rate. That said, the mortgage was taken out in 2020, when the average 30-year fixed rate was 3.38%; like many other Americans, the couple took advantage of the historically low rates of the time. Their home value is estimated between $1 million and $5 million, and they have a seven-year adjustable-rate mortgage, which is also unusual. That means in a couple of years their interest rate could increase, although it is possible they could refinance to keep the lower rate, which they have already done once. Their mortgage is their only listed debt, which is also out of the norm for Gen Xers. According to the\u00a0Federal Reserve, Gen Xers hold about 36.6% of debt in the U.S., though they make up less than 20% of the population. They also carry the most credit card debt of any generation, according to a recent survey, and tend to have more student-loan debt than the generations before them (though less than millennials). Harris and Emhoff reported $450,299 in income in 2023, according to tax returns released by the White House earlier this year. That includes Harris\u2019s $218,784 salary as vice president, and Emhoff\u2019s $174,994 wages as a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. They also made around $6,000 from book royalties and over $50,600 in taxable interest. The average Gen X household made $126,892 in income in 2022, according to the\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics. The income is a notable drop from their 2020 income, which totaled over $1.65 million. Emhoff earned $582,543 that year as a lawyer; he left his firms when Harris was sworn in as vice president. Finances aside, Harris is representative of her position on the cusp between generations in other ways. For one, she could also be the first woman president, as well as the first Asian American president. She exemplifies the fact that younger boomers form a much more diverse group than older boomers. Gen X is even more so: Not only is it far more racially diverse than the generations before, but it\u2019s the first to see a nearly equitable labor force participation rate between men and women."

        "author": "Bill Fotsch",
        "body": "Private equity roll-ups are gaining traction. The industry is growing five times faster than the U.S. economy as a whole and effectively \u201cdevouring\u201d it. And there are rising concerns about PE\u2019s impact on affordability and market power. Private equity companies are in the business of making money, and industry roll-ups present an opportunity to do so efficiently for several reasons: Private equity companies recognize this model enables them to extract significant financial rewards. But company owners are beginning to realize they can beat private equity with a compelling alternative approach. This became apparent to me through conversations with several past clients from decades ago. Few had successfully transitioned their companies to new owners. Several had been acquired by private equity firms. While they were pleased to seal the deal, I sensed a level of regret. One president told me that he had been acquired by a private equity company.\u00a0He was subsequently asked to stay on as a consultant to help them acquire even more companies and share the same best practices we had applied at his company. The first part went according to plan.\u00a0They were successful at acquiring more companies. However, he admitted there was little success in sharing best practices. As he put it, PE companies are good at transactions, but not very good at operations. The truth is, while PE companies have the unique capital and experience to acquire companies, they have little expertise in specific industries or running a company. Yet they extract a fortune for their efforts at industry roll-ups. Why can\u2019t company owners create roll-ups like this themselves, without any private equity involvement? Another past client, a civil engineering company based in Wisconsin, did just that. They made over 20 acquisitions in their sector with the following characteristics: The result? Their valuation surged more than sixfold in the last five years, with no sign of slowing. It\u2019s a win-win in which customers benefit, and the wealth created remains in the hands of those who work hard to create it.\u00a0 Pooling resources under one ESOP structure means the cost of the ESOP per company plummets. Individual companies can operate autonomously. Meanwhile, the employees become company owners, who can directly improve the value of their stock by sharing and implementing best practices. Their chances of succeeding at this are greater than the PE company\u2019s because they understand their industry and people. And if they apply a management approach like economic engagement, which is shown to double profit growth, this further enhances their competitive edge. This industry roll-up alternative is becoming known as \u201crewarding roll-ups.\u201d ESOPs are frequently seen as an exit tool for owners, but rewarding roll-ups uses it as a foundation for considerable additional growth in equity, shared by both employees and owners. And there is at least one additional benefit: job security. In an inevitable downturn, a PE company likely won\u2019t care about laying off employees. But companies courting this novel model can invite more companies into the roll-up at lower costs due to the downturn. The expansion creates plenty of work for existing employees, improving job security and stock value, and ultimately boosting profits for everyone. It\u2019s worth noting that the aforementioned civil engineering company hasn\u2019t had a layoff in the last 20+ years. Broad awareness and adoption of this approach are limited but growing quickly. By reframing ESOPs as a platform for growth rather than just an exit strategy, company owners can make something even more meaningful of their life\u2019s work. It\u2019s time we find a compelling alternative to private equity. It\u2019s time to invest back into the people who create a company\u2019s value: the employees and the stakeholders.

        "body": "Dozens of people, including the Massachusetts governor and several sports stars, dumped cold water on themselves at Fenway Park Thursday to mark the 10th anniversary of the\u00a0ALS ice bucket challenge. The event is part of an effort to renew interest in the viral social media campaign that has raised money to find a cure for Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. Organizers said the campaign has raised $250 million thus far and led to an additional $1 billion in research funding. \u201cOur son\u2019s life was one of grace, determination and purpose, that through his resilience, diligence and courage, he created a movement that is still being celebrated today for all those that have been affected by this horrific disease,\u201d said Nancy Frates,\u00a0the mother of Pete Frates, who helped popularize the challenge along with\u00a0Pat Quinn. Both were diagnosed with ALS and have since died. \u201cEven though his human body is no longer with us, his powerful spirit is still being celebrated along with the historic movement,\u201d she said. \u201cYou brought results. But as Pete would say, \u2018We can have fun today but the job isn\u2019t done. Let\u2019s get back to work tomorrow.\u2019\u201d Dr. Merit Cudkowicz, the director of the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at Mass General Hospital who was also Pete Frates\u2019 doctor, recalled her first meeting with him and how he vowed to raise $1 billion for ALS research. Among the benefits there have been more drugs to treat the disease. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that dumping a bucket of ice over your head was going to change how we think about ALS, but that simple act did more to raise awareness for ALS than any other effort, and it catalyzed amazing research advances,\u201d she told the crowed of several hundred including ALS patients and their families. \u201cIt brought so many new scientists to the field all over the world and that\u2019s making the difference today for people living with ALS.\u201d After the speakers finished, about 75 people, including several families with small children, lined up on the baseball field in front of tiny buckets. All at once, they dumped ice-cold water from tiny buckets onto their heads, a relief to many on the day when temperatures reached into the 90s. In the stands, Mike Cunningham, 54, of Canton, Massachusetts, was watching the event from his wheelchair. Diagnosed with ALS last year, he admitted it can sometimes be hard to get out of his house. But he said he wasn\u2019t going to miss Thursday\u2019s event, which gave him a sense of pride, hope, courage and \u201cthankfulness for all the kindness that people show.\u201d \u201cPeople are good. People are kind and they step up when people need help,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget that with all the news you hear every day. You see it. You feel it, the kindness. Friends, neighbors, strangers that come out and try to help fight this awful disease.\u201d In 2014, Quinn saw the ice bucket challenge on the social media feed of professional golfer Chris Kennedy, who first dared his wife\u2019s cousin Jeanette Senerchia to take a bucket of ice water, dump it over her head, post a video on social media and ask others to do the same or to make a donation to charity. Senerchia\u2019s husband had ALS. Quinn and Frates helped popularize the challenge. When the two picked it up, the phenomenon exploded. Thousands of people participated in the viral trend, including celebrities, sports stars and politicians. Online videos were viewed millions of times. Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, named after the New York Yankees great who suffered from it \u2014 is also known as ALS or motor neuron disease. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to paralysis due to the death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. There is no known cure. "

        "body": "Good morning! DEI has shot to fame over the past few years, as politicians and business leaders turned it into a lightning rod within U.S. culture wars.\u00a0 A vocal group of powerful people are dead set against the practice, and the headline-grabbing backlash is undeniable. But a new report shows that when it comes down to it, DEI\u2014short for diversity, equity, and inclusion\u2014is actually pretty popular among workers, and approval rates are on the rise.\u00a0 Demand for DEI programs among workers is up 9% since 2022, to 60% of people overall, the same percentage it was in 2020, according to Edelman\u2019s 2024 Trust Barometer report on business and racial justice released in July. Support for such programs rose in 2020 after a racial reckoning sparked by the murder of George Floyd, but dipped a few years later. And the number of workers who view DEI initiatives as \u201cmore positive\u201d has doubled to 38% over the past three to five years. The uptick in favorability is also widespread\u2014increases are seen across race, gender, and socioeconomic lines.\u00a0 So how can we make sense of this contrast between a backlash against DEI in theory, and an embrace of it in practice?\u00a0 \u201cI think that there is a very loud minority, and this in terms of the efficacy, the importance of the benefit of the DEI programming,\u201d says Trisch Smith, global chief diversity, equity & inclusion officer at Edelman, a PR and marketing consulting firm. \u201cThis research does show us that there is an employee demand for diversity programs.\u201d Among workers with an employer that had more DEI initiatives, employees reported an increased sense of belonging compared to workers with an employer that had fewer initiatives. This was true across political affiliations: It was 29% higher for independent voters, 28% for Democrats, and 17% for Republicans. Companies with more DEI initiatives also had a higher percentage of employees willing to recommend that organization to other people, regardless of party.\u00a0 \u201cThere is shared understanding and recognition of the benefit of this work to individuals across various demographics,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThat it\u2019s not only a select few, or certain communities who are in support of the work.\u201d The approval of DEI dovetails with a larger trend: When it comes to addressing racism, people have more faith in their employer than they do in other institutions. Around 54% of respondents said they expect the government to take the lead, while only 23% said the government was doing a good job, according to data collected this year. And while only 38% of people expected their employer to address racism, 62% said their employer was doing a good job. Around 75% of respondents said that DEI initiatives in the workplace were an effective way to address racism.\u00a0 Prominent billionaires like Bill Ackman and Elon Musk have attacked DEI over the past several months. In a war of words with Harvard, Ackman wrote in a 4,000-word post on social media platform X that DEI was \u201cinherently inconsistent with basic American values.\u201d Musk called DEI \u201cpropaganda words,\u201d despite the policies at his own company, Tesla. And he recently shared a manipulated video on social media of presidential candidate and current vice president Kamala Harris calling her \u201cdiversity hire\u201d who \u201cdoesn\u2019t know the first thing about running the country.\u201d When DEI programs are challenged by critics, the Edelman report recommends addressing the criticism head on, inviting meaningful dialogue, and creating platforms to encourage employees to speak up. Using \u201cplain language\u201d is also key. That can even be simple things, like using the phrase \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d rather than just \u201cDEI.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt can be at all hands, it can be email here for questions,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen organizations providing the proper tools to help their managers have the conversations, even on a one-on-one basis or within their teams. So it\u2019s also not necessarily solely CEO, but also at more again, the local level, if you will, within your team within your department.\u201dAzure Gilmanazure.gilman@fortune.com Today\u2019s edition was curated by Emma Burleigh.

        "body": "Every election cycle seems to launch a new predictions star. In 2008, it was CNN\u2019s John King and his \u201cMagic Wall\u201d of color-coded electoral data. Later cycles saw the rise of the \u201ctwo Nates\u201d (Silver and Cohn), whose brand of statistics journalism made gimmicks like the New York Times\u2019 prediction needle a fixture of political coverage. In 2024, all eyes have been turning to a new election year darling: the website Polymarket. The betting site, which is built on blockchain technology, has become a go-to for political insiders after several instances where it anticipated major election developments well ahead of the media. In the past few months, for example, Polymarket foreshadowed President Joe Biden dropping his reelection bid and Donald Trump selecting JD Vance as his running mate. The site\u2019s reputation has grown to such a degree that Nate Silver himself agreed to join the company as an adviser. Polymarket\u2019s creator, barely known outside of a small circle of crypto types, is Shayne Coplan, a 26-year-old New York City native whose appearance suggests he should be on tour with an alt-rock band rather than running one of the most influential sites in contemporary politics. Coplan has so far avoided the limelight, but that\u2019s likely to change in the near future as Polymarket\u2014which has raised $70 million in funding\u2014grows its profile in U.S. political life. At a recent dinner party in Manhattan, Coplan arrived in jeans and a leather jacket. He had come at the behest of a venture capital firm that had convened startups in its portfolio to network and meet members of the media. Coplan was easy to spot by the unruly basket of curls framing his head, and a casual demeanor that set him apart from the other founders. While venture capitalists like to say they don\u2019t have a favorite child among their portfolio companies, the organizer discreetly identified \u201cthe Polymarket guy\u201d as the one most worth meeting. Coplan, however, appeared in no rush to make the rounds and, after some polite conversing, he left during the main course, apologetically telling the table he had to get to a concert in Brooklyn. New York is a place Coplan knows well. He was raised on the Upper West Side by his mother and attended public school in Hell\u2019s Kitchen near the theater district. As a teenager, he learned to code and, according to crypto lore, became the youngest participant in the initial sale of Ethereum in 2014\u2014a time when the token, which trades for around $3,500 today, could be purchased for 30 cents. Coplan would go on to pursue a computer science degree at New York University, but then leave before graduating in order to pursue a growing obsession: crypto and prediction markets. \u201cHe wants to be able to talk about it forever. This is his life. He lives it,\u201d says Rob Hadick, a partner at the venture capital firm Dragonfly, one of Polymarket\u2019s investors. He added that, at an initial meeting, Coplan eschewed a formal pitch in a conference room and instead proposed a walk, which turned into a two-hour stroll around New York, during which Coplan talked Hadick\u2019s ear off about prediction markets. As books like The Wisdom of Crowds explain, using collective predictions to determine the likelihood of future events is often more reliable than consulting experts. The concept is hardly new, and indeed variations of it\u2014including market-based prediction markets\u2014have been around for centuries. And while there are other online betting platforms like Ireland\u2019s Paddy Power, which lets users wager on everything from sports to politics, Coplan says Polymarket is different. \u201cIt\u2019s much more categorized as a derivatives platform, where the pricing of such derivatives becomes invaluable real-time info,\u201d Coplan said by text message\u2014pointing to the fact that odds are determined on a continuous basis by a pool of bettors, rather than by a centralized oddsmaker. (Polymarket is also notable for settling and paying out wagers using smart contracts\u2014specifically via a sub-layer of the Ethereum blockchain known as Polygon.) In recent months, Coplan has had the opportunity to talk up the benefits of his site directly with politicians, including at a breakfast with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Last week, he also posted a retweet that shows images from the site displayed around RNC headquarters\u2014but so far has been careful not to reveal his own political leanings. Asked for a formal interview\u2014something he has not done since 2020 when Polymarket first came to attention\u2014Coplan politely demurs, citing a busy schedule. Coplan\u2019s online footprint is a shallow one. There are a handful of pictures online showing a 20-year-old Coplan, sans curls, addressing a crypto gathering and partaking in a boat cruise at the Bitcoin Miami conference in 2018. But he has otherwise avoided the glare of the media\u2014though, as Polymarket becomes a household name, he may not have this luxury much longer. Most people are familiar with online betting sites, including U.S. ones for sports betting or overseas ones that let punters wager on everything from elections to probability of aliens landing. Polymarket offers all these bets too, but under the hood it works very differently. Instead of a central oddsmaker, the probability of a given event is determined by Polymarket users who can buy \u201cshares\u201d in a given outcome. For instance, on July 31, those who think Donald Trump will replace his ticket mate JD Vance could pay 8 cents, and if that comes to pass, the value of their contract will rise to $1 (if it doesn\u2019t by election time, it will drop to zero). And, of course, the price will fluctuate in response to news events. Polymarket for now has declined to pursue the most obvious source of potential revenue: taking a cut of the wagers on the site. Instead, its evolving business model\u2014which includes a forthcoming feature that will let users pay with credit cards instead of just crypto\u2014appears to involve a media, and possibly a consulting, operation. Semafor reported this week that Polymarket is in the process of rolling out a series of newsletters, while also pairing with major media outlets that will include its data in their coverage (charts from the site have already turned up in the Wall Street Journal). The company has not disclosed how much, if any, revenue it will earn from these ventures. There is also the potential for Polymarket to charge for given bets to appear on its sites. Currently, the company fields suggestions on its Discord platform, and then informs its community which ones will be added. Some of the most recent additions include bets on Simone Biles\u2019 medal haul and the likelihood of a U.S.-Iran military conflict by Aug. 31. For now, though, there is no indication Polymarket plans to let companies pay to list a bet. Polymarket is not the first site of its kind. Earlier crypto projects like Augur and Gnosis likewise offered a decentralized betting platform, but they never got traction. Polymarket, by contrast, has become a fixture of political Twitter and, according to Nick Tomaino\u2014whose venture fund 1Confirmation has invested in all of these projects\u2014is the go-to site for 85% of all online wagers on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. The site\u2019s rapid growth\u2014it attracted a record 42,000 bettors on July 1, up from 4,000 in January\u2014is perhaps surprising given that bettors in the U.S., where wagers on elections are illegal, are barred from using the platform, and that Polymarket requires users to connect a crypto wallet and pay using the USDC stablecoin. These barriers also raise the question of whether Polymarket bettors\u2014who are mostly non-Americans steeped in crypto culture\u2014can offer reliable predictions of U.S. election events. Tomaino acknowledges that it would result in a better sample if Americans could participate, but says Polymarket nonetheless offers a very strong signal. This is because, like other prediction markets, it reflects not just the \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d but is based on a group of people with a financial stake in an outcome, and who are likely to be more knowledgeable. In assessing Polymarket and betting markets of all sorts, it\u2019s also useful to recall that the probable outcomes they display are just that\u2014probabilities. In 2016, most pollsters and betting sites said that Hillary Clinton had a 75% to 85% chance of victory. The fact that she lost does not discredit those predictions, but rather reflects there was a smaller\u2014but very real\u2014probability that Donald Trump would win, and that is the probability that materialized. Polymarket is not just an intriguing new fixture of the U.S. election scene. It is also a hot startup whose $70 million raised so far, including a $45 million funding round in May, comes from influential investors. They include not only crypto royalty including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and early Coinbase employees, but also prominent venture capitalists such as Peter Thiel. Still, it remains unclear how exactly Polymarket intends to make money. According to Tomaino, the site\u2019s revenue is currently \u201cvery low\u201d even as it pays for overhead like an office in New York City and a staff of somewhere between 25 and 30. And Polymarket\u2019s biggest challenge may be persuading regulators to let it operate in the U.S. at all. In 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, pursuant to the financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank, banned derivatives or so-called event contracts that involve terrorism and other illegal activities, including \u201cgaming.\u201d While the CFTC\u2014which fined Polymarket $1.2 million in 2021 for operating in the U.S.\u2014didn\u2019t define gaming at the time, it is currently crafting new regulations to explicitly ban election wagers. The investor Tomaino is unfazed by all this. He views concerns that election wagers could corrupt the political process as misguided, noting that such wagers have provided insight for over a century and that super PACs\u2014which allow anonymous donors to spend millions of dollars on behalf of candidates\u2014would seem to be a bigger threat to election integrity. As for Coplan, Tomaino says, he will likely become more visible in coming months. But for now he is \u201cjust head-down focused on the product.\u201d"

CoinFund led the raise, with participation from Accomplice, Anagram, and Legion Capital, among others. The company, which is valued at $21 million, wants to become the world\u2019s first open-source network for professional connections. Its cofounders, Dan Stone and Jack Dill\u00e9, hail from Google and Coinbase; Stone was a product manager at the crypto giant and also the cocreator of Google\u2019s largest cross-identity measurement and marketing platform, and Dill\u00e9 was a design lead for Google Workspace. The pair founded Icebreaker on the joint belief that the trail of one\u2019s digital identity\u2014and reputation\u2014shouldn\u2019t be owned by a single entity, but rather publicly owned and accessible to all. Frustrated that platforms like LinkedIn restrict how we leverage our own contacts, Dill\u00e9 told Fortune that he hopes to remove the paywalls and credits, which \u201crequire us to pay just to navigate our own network.\u201d Using blockchain technology, Icebreaker allows users to transfer their existing professional profile and network all into one verified channel. \u201cImagine if you click the log-in button, and then you see the entirety of your network across LinkedIn, Twitter, Farcaster, and email? Imagine how many intros could be more effectively routed if you could see the full picture of how you are connected with somebody,\u201d Stone told Fortune.\u00a0 Users can instantly prove their credentials and provide verifiable endorsements for people in their network.

        "body": "A company that provides the infrastructure for cross-border payments today announced it has closed a Series A funding round. Layer2 Financial raised $10.7 million, led by Galaxy Ventures, with participation from Accomplice and Sapphire Ventures, and intends to use the money to further its plans to \u201crevolutionize the way money moves around the globe,\u201d the company said in a statement. Layer2 Financial, a Toronto-based company, securely moves billions of dollars of both fiat and digital currencies across the world each year. Layer2\u2019s customers include non-bank financial institutions, traditional banks, neobanks (also known as fintechs, such as Revolut and Monzo), enterprise organizations, and other payments companies.  \u201cOur long term goal is to replace Swift over the next 10 years, and we\u2019re going to do that by building operations in a number of countries, with jurisdictions globally. And once we do that, money will never have to touch the Swift system,\u201d Bhanu Kohli, CEO and founder of Layer2 Financial, told Fortune. \u201cIt will basically go over a blockchain, from one jurisdiction to another,\u201d he added.  The company\u2019s multi-partner platform provides its customers with compliant payments for multiple currencies. Using its API, a customer can collect and send payments, in addition to transferring currencies (including from digital to fiat, and vice versa), using ACH, Fedwire, Swift, SEPA, and tokenized assets, among others. The platform is currently regulated in approximately 34 U.S. states, which constitutes the bulk of its businesses. It is also licensed in Canada and Europe.  AngelList, the American fundraising software company, which connects start-ups, angel investors and limited partners, is among Layer2 Financial\u2019s customers. \u201cYou may have an LP sitting in Europe or the U.K. that wants to invest into a fund in the U.S. on AngelList platform. AngelList uses us to collect from the LP,\u201d Kholi explained. So, for example, an LP might send $1 million of USDC to the platform, which is then converted into USD and sent to the fund, in less than 24 hours. If the LP had to send that money via Swift, it would take longer, explained Kholi. Cross-border business-to-business payments are \u201cfundamentally complex,\u201d he added, but Layer2\u2019s infrastructure makes the process \u201cfaster, more transparent, and cost-effective,\u201d Mike Giampapa, general partner at Galaxy Ventures, said in a statement. \u201cThe evolution of the payments system, especially leveraging digital assets and stablecoins alongside fiat, presents a unique opportunity that we are very excited to be a part of \u2014 Layer2\u2019s platform is uniquely positioned to disrupt the traditional payments ecosystem,\u201d  The company plans to utilize the funding to advance its product development, expand in new jurisdictions, and to grow its team."

        "author": "Vivienne Walt",
        "body": "About 180 miles south of Berlin sits the small town of Zwickau, home to a sprawling Volkswagen factory\u2014and a perfect encapsulation of the past century\u2019s epic history. Generations of German autoworkers have built cars in the area, since the dawn of the combustion engine in the early 1900s, through the Nazi regime, the devastating Second World War, and decades of Cold War isolation from the West, when Zwickau\u2019s auto production was a prized Communist asset in the heart of East Germany. But step inside the Zwickau factory now and the clanging noise of robots and steel car parts is the soundtrack of a new epic drama\u2014one that will define the $4\u00a0trillion global auto industry for decades to come: the EV revolution. Here in Volkswagen\u2019s first all-electric car factory, the company is live-testing the strategy for its long-term growth, in which EVs will become an ever bigger part of the world\u2019s auto market. The question in this new battle is not whether Volkswagen can survive the world\u2019s steady shift from the combustion engine vehicles that it began making 87 years ago; its endurance seems assured. Last year it earned a whopping $348\u00a0billion in revenues and delivered 9.24\u00a0million vehicles. Rather, the question is whether Volkswagen can successfully pull off a transition to electric vehicles quickly and efficiently enough, as the global EV market begins to lift off in earnest and competition for EV tech and raw materials heats up among China, the U.S., and Europe. The answer could determine whether the manufacturing giant emerges a winner in this new EV age, or whether it will be outwitted and outpaced by nimble newcomers. And as more Chinese electric cars surge into global auto markets, other legacy carmakers will likely face the same dilemma. As Volkswagen is discovering, increasing one\u2019s odds in the contest is both complex and dizzyingly expensive, with no leeway for slow-footedness. It launched its EV strategy only in the mid-2010s, years after Tesla and China\u2019s BYD had sold their first electric cars. In Zwickau, Volkswagen plowed more than $1.3\u00a0billion over the past five years into turning its combustion-engine factory into the company\u2019s first pure-EV production facility\u2014a top-to-bottom retrofit that it now regards as its blueprint for how to transform some of Volkswagen\u2019s other 120 plants globally. Despite the investment, Zwickau is falling short of expectations: Two years after the first EVs rolled off the assembly line, production figures are slipping, from 247,000 in 2023 to a projected 220,000 cars this year. Even so, Volkswagen is pushing ahead with plans to increase its EV output hugely in the coming years, no matter the expense, including aiming to sell 4\u00a0million EVs in China by 2030, and for more than half of cars it sells globally to be electric by then. A lack of action, it believes, could prove far more costly.\u00a0 Volkswagen\u2019s EV plan revolves around creating and increasingly acquiring battery technology and platforms that can work across multiple models, leveraging its giant size.\u00a0 \u201cWe are very committed to our strategy,\u201d Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume tells Fortune. Proof of that, he says, is the roughly $130\u00a0billion the company has committed to a massive EV ramp-up over the next five years, of which Zwickau is a key element. For years, many insiders questioned the need for such a mammoth investment in electrification. But that internal debate is now settled, according to Blume. \u201cI think that electromobility is the prime technology of the future for the automotive industry,\u201d he notes, fresh from signing a $5\u00a0billion partnership with California electric carmaker Rivian to jointly develop next-generation EV software. The question for Volkswagen is whether its deep pockets and huge scale of production can be harnessed in the transition, or whether its sheer size will slow it down. \u201cThere is an advantage to being big, and there is a detriment to being big,\u201d says Joe McCabe, president and CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, industry data analysts in Chester Springs, Pa. \u201cThe new producers can be like speedboats.\u201d The last time Fortune visited Volkswagen\u2019s massive German auto plants, in early 2022, just that kind of \u201cspeedboat\u201d had roared up: Tesla. Elon Musk\u2019s spectacular growth in EV sales had turned Tesla into a leader in electric cars in both China and the U.S., virtually inventing the global EV market in little more than a decade. By 2022, Musk had his sights set on Europe, a market of 450\u00a0million people with long-held loyalty to indigenous brands like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes. Adding to Volkswagen\u2019s discomfort, Musk had broken ground on Tesla\u2019s first European gigafactory, a three-hour drive east of Volkswagen\u2019s iconic headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. While Tesla\u2019s factory had not yet opened at that time, its threat was already clear in Wolfsburg. Then\u2013CEO of Volkswagen Herbert Diess told Fortune at the time that the company\u2019s sluggish response to the EV revolution was the result of its vast size\u2014Volkswagen employs about 680,000 people across the world, more than half of them in Germany. Diess called it \u201can empire\u201d that had been lulled into feeling \u201crock-solid and unbeatable.\u201d Today that sense of invincibility has left Volkswagen, and so has Diess, whose exit in September 2022 came after tensions over his push to develop EV software from scratch. The resulting Cariad software division was plagued with glitches and delays, costing the company valuable time in rolling out electric models. But even with new partnerships, Volkswagen, as well as Tesla, now confronts the threat from a far bigger \u201cempire\u201d: China. The rise of Chinese EVs has stunned lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe.\u00a0 The sales of Chinese electric vehicles are still relatively small in Europe, and are largely unavailable to American buyers owing to a mix of tariffs and restrictions on some critical minerals from China. But it is not the sales figures themselves that are spooking Western governments and auto giants like Volkswagen. It is the speed at which those figures are increasing\u2014echoing for many Tesla\u2019s unexpected surge into the market 15 years ago. China\u2019s total car sales have accelerated at a mind-boggling pace, increasing more than fourfold this century, from about 6\u00a0million combustion-engine and electric vehicles in 2000 to about 26\u00a0million last year, compared with total car sales of 17\u00a0million in the U.S. and 13\u00a0million in Europe. About 14 million EVs were sold globally in 2023, of which 60% were in China, according to the International Energy Agency. Last year, the Shenzhen producer BYD, China\u2019s largest EV company, overtook Tesla for the first time as the world\u2019s biggest electric-car seller, tripling its exports in just one year, in part by shipping thousands of vehicles to Europe, where it has opened sales rooms in Stockholm, Paris, and Berlin. While BYD\u2019s Europe business represents less than 1% of its global sales, that share could increase sharply once BYD\u2019s first European factory opens in Hungary next year. \u201cThe sales are still very low, but the quality is high, and they have a good pricing system,\u201d Jens Katzek, head of the Automotive Cluster East Germany, a regional industry group, says of Chinese EVs. Last year, China\u2019s EV producers sold 4.66\u00a0million vehicles globally versus Tesla\u2019s 1.81\u00a0million and Volkswagen\u2019s 770,000. \u201cThere is an advantage to being big, and there is a detriment to being big. The new producers can be like speedboats.\u201d When I arrived in Zwickau in late June, millions of Europeans were glued to their TVs, watching the European Championships\u2014a monthlong soccer extravaganza featuring 24 countries. Few fans would have missed seeing the premier car sponsor, BYD, whose three letters were splashed across the edge of the pitches. It was a striking change from previous tournaments, when Volkswagen had been the partner. The switch stung\u2014especially in Zwickau. \u201cIt was really on the minds of people,\u201d says Katzek. \u201cPeople realize suddenly, there\u2019s something from far away you\u2019d never heard about before.\u201d\u00a0 Like the U.S. government, the EU has scrambled to try to ward off the impact of Chinese EVs, and to protect a century of carmaking prowess. After a six-month probe, it announced in June that it would impose steep tariffs on Chinese EVs starting in October, including a 17% tariff on BYD cars, on top of existing 10% import duties, and a 38% tariff on SAIC\u2014the Shanghai carmaker with which Volkswagen formed its first Chinese joint venture when it arrived in China in 1984. The Volkswagen group built a huge business for itself in China in the decades before those Chinese automakers took off. It has 39 auto plants in China, a workforce of more than 90,000, and an estimated 3,000 dealerships. \u201cThat\u2019s a big network,\u201d says Blume, who did his PhD studies in Shanghai. \u201cWe count on a strong relationship in the country.\u201d\u00a0 Even so, that relationship might not sustain sales as the country increasingly shifts to EVs. Last year, BYD overtook Volkswagen-branded cars as the top seller (of both fossil-fuel and electric cars) in China. The Chinese market is saturated with more than 100 EV companies that have slashed prices in a struggle to survive; more than 12 manufacturers shuttered production in 2023, according to a Chinese industry association. Added to that are a raft of incentives for consumers to buy Chinese-made EVs rather than fossil-fuel cars, including quicker delivery times and cheaper registration fees. More and more, the EV factories that do survive, like BYD and its smaller competitors Nio and XPeng, produce high-end cars with state-of-the-art technology\u2014often outshining old Western partners like Volkswagen.\u00a0 That much was clear at the Beijing Auto Show in April, where 900 exhibitions drew large crowds. \u201cThe non-Chinese stands had no interest from the public or the press,\u201d recalls Felipe Mu\u00f1oz, senior global analyst for JATO Dynamics, an automotive consulting firm. \u201cThe Western carmakers were looking at how [Chinese rivals] had become so powerful so fast, and wondering what to do and why did they let this happen.\u201d The answer to that is complex, including perhaps that Western auto giants believed they were \u201cunbeatable\u201d empires, in the words of Diess. \u201cThey should have foreseen the rapid evolution of EVs in China,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz, who argues that one problem was crafting strategy in Europe, remote from the rapid changes. \u201cThey were the leaders, and when all these shifts came, they were not ready,\u201d he says. Two years after the first electric cars rolled off the Zwickau assembly line, Volkswagen execs and autoworkers describe the factory\u2019s rapid transformation as the result of their finely tuned precision planning. The production floor had made VW\u00a0Golf cars for decades. Volkswagen gutted it, installing its modular electric toolkit chassis, which was built in-house and fits dozens of different car models within the group. At full capacity, the Zwickau facility can build 360,000 cars a year\u2014about one every minute\u2014turning out three Volkswagen and two Audi models, and one SEAT hatchback. Yet Zwickau\u2019s operations are far from full capacity. EV orders hover around 240,000 a year and have sunk with high inflation rates and the arrival in Europe of cheaper Chinese EVs. Worse, last December the German government halted its generous tax breaks on new EVs almost overnight, owing to the country\u2019s budget crisis\u2014a move recounted angrily in almost every conversation I had in Zwickau. Orders dropped almost immediately. In half-year results in July, the company forecasted that profits on sales could fall 1% this year over last, and said it may shut its Brussels plant that produces Audi EVs, which would mark its first factory closure in 36 years. Globally, Volkswagen delivered more than 2.24\u00a0million vehicles in the second quarter\u2014down 3.8% from the same period in 2023. Last year, Zwickau cut one of its three eight-hour production shifts and laid off some workers on temporary contracts. \u201cA couple of years ago we were the lighthouse of the industry,\u201d says Marc Stephan, vice president of production in Zwickau, who spent four years at Volkswagen\u2019s Chattanooga plant before transferring to the EV factory in 2022. \u201cNow we are more like the seismograph of the industry.\u201d That is the pessimistic outlook, however\u2014one that is not universally shared. McCabe, of AutoForecast Solutions, believes the company will ultimately emerge as an industry front-runner\u2014and possibly the winner\u2014since its mix of EVs and combustion-engine vehicles allows it to hedge one segment against the other, giving it a more dependable future than Tesla or BYD.\u00a0 Volkswagen is also ramping up its EV technology\u2014as evidenced by its Rivian investment\u2014and its electrification efforts. Two years ago Volkswagen split off its battery operation as a subsidiary called PowerCo. The new unit in July signed a $130\u00a0million deal with San Jose\u2013based QuantumScape to license next-generation solid-state EV batteries that retain 95% power for 300,000 miles. Volkswagen also adapted its 50-year-old combustion-engine plant in the west German town of Salzgitter to produce EV batteries, capable of powering about 4\u00a0million EVs a year. \u201c[Volkswagen] already [has] the sales channels and a significant footprint in the BEV space,\u201d McCabe says, referring to battery-powered EVs. Based on his company\u2019s data, he says, \u201cif we fast-forward to 2028, we have Volkswagen taking a leadership position globally in BEVs.\u201d\u00a0 Blume hopes that prediction is correct. The strategy has shifted since he took over as CEO two years ago, from the nearly century-old auto giant steadily becoming an all-electric company to continuing to offer hundreds of options, including many fossil-fuel cars. That breadth of options is especially important in the U.S., where only about 8% of new-car sales are pure electric. \u201cIt is about\u2009\u2026\u2009being flexible,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Few are as deeply familiar with evolution as the autoworkers of Zwickau, generations of whom have worked in car plants through wars and Communist isolation. The EV race is just the latest global transformation.\u2002 This article appears in the August/September 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, \u201cInside Volkswagen\u2019s EV comeback.\u201d"
