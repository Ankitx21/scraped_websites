        "body": "California lawmakers have amended a bill that would create new restrictions for artificial intelligence, paving the way for first-of-their-kind safety rules that could set new standards for how tech companies develop their systems. The State Assembly\u2019s Appropriations Committee voted on Thursday to endorse an amended version of the bill, S.B. 1047, which would require companies to test the safety of powerful A.I. technologies before releasing them to the public. California\u2019s attorney general would be able to sue companies if their technologies caused serious harm, such as mass property damage or human casualties. The bill has sparked fierce debate in the tech industry, with Silicon Valley giants, academics and investors taking sides on whether to regulate a nascent technology that has been hyped for both its benefits and its dangers. Senator Scott Wiener, the author of the bill, made several concessions in an effort to appease tech industry critics like OpenAI, Meta and Google. The changes also reflect some suggestions made by another prominent start-up, Anthropic. The bill would no longer create a new agency for A.I. safety, instead shifting regulatory duties to the existing California Government Operations Agency. And companies would be liable for violating the law only if their technologies caused real harm or imminent dangers to public safety. Previously, the bill allowed for companies to be punished for failing to adhere to safety regulations even if no harm had yet occurred. \u201cThe new amendments reflect months of constructive dialogue with industry, start-up and academic stakeholders,\u201d said Dan Hendrycks, a founder of the nonprofit Center for A.I. Safety in San Francisco, which helped write the bill. A Google spokesperson said the company\u2019s previous concerns \u201cstill stand.\u201d Anthropic said it was still reviewing the changes. OpenAI and Meta declined to comment on the amended bill. Mr. Wiener said in a statement on Thursday that \u201cwe can advance both innovation and safety; the two are not mutually exclusive.\u201d He said he believed the amendments addressed many of the tech industry\u2019s concerns. The Democratic-majority Legislature is expected to pass the bill by the end of the month. It would then go to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has not said whether he supports it. If the bill is signed, California will again be a step ahead of the federal government on tech regulation. California\u2019s Legislature has helped shape U.S. tech consumer protections with a 2020 privacy law that curbed the collection of user data and a 2022 child online safety law. Opponents of the A.I. bill have argued that it would discourage tech giants from sharing the software code underlying their artificial intelligence with other businesses and software developers \u2014 a practice known as open source. They believe this would choke the progress of smaller A.I. companies. While the amendments alleviated some issues and improved on the earlier version, \u201cthe open source software community still rightly has concerns that this will be a damper on A.I. development,\u201d said Chris Nicholson, a partner with Page One Ventures, a venture capital firm. Several candidates for mayor in San Francisco, where much of the A.I. start-up community is based, have questioned the bill. \u201cSan Francisco\u2019s reputation as a leader in technology and innovation is because we embrace new ideas and serve as a sanctuary for research and development, and S.B. 1047 clearly threatens our brand and leadership,\u201d said Mark Farrell, a former interim mayor and current candidate. Lauren Wagner, an investor and researcher who has worked for both Google and Meta, said the amended version of the bill was an improvement. But she argued that regulation of A.I. should be a federal issue, not something for state lawmakers. \u201cThis seems like something the federal government should take on,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not light touch.\u201d",
