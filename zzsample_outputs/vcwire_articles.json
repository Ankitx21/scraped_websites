The program is designed to enhance capital availability for Israeli startups via investments of Institutional entities in venture capital funds through a governmental matching mechanism. The initiative was oversubscribed by approximately $474 million, with nearly all institutional Investment entities in Israel choosing to participate. The following entities were selected: Altshuler Shaham Provident and Pension Ltd., Israel Aircraft Industry Providence Fund Ltd., Analyst, The Phoenix Insurance Company Ltd., Harel Insurance Investments and Financial Services Ltd., Engineers and Technicians \u2013 Provident Fund Management Company Ltd., Provident Fund Management Company Ltd., Yahav Education Fund & Savings for Nurses Ltd., Reut Insurance Agents and Consultants Ltd., Menora Mivtachim Insurance Ltd., Meitav Provident Funds and Pension Ltd., Mivtahim Social Insurance Institute of The Workers Ltd., More Provident Funds and Pension Ltd., Migdal Insurance Company Ltd., Continuing Education Fund for Teachers Ltd., Makefet Fund Pension and Benefits Center Cooperative Society Ltd., Clal Insurance and The Central Pension Fund of Histadrut Workers Ltd. To address this over-demand, a second phase of the fund is planned for the 2025 budget year. The fund\u2019s goal is to support Israeli high-tech companies, expand the ties between institutional entities and local venture capital funds as is customary in leading markets worldwide, and increase the stability of the local venture capital market against shocks and macroeconomic fluctuations. As a result of the program, the scope of institutional investments in Israeli venture capital funds is expected to grow, thereby increasing the availability of capital for Israeli high-tech companies. The fund is intended for institutional Investors such as insurance companies, pension funds, and provident funds, offering a unique yield enhancement mechanism for their investments in Israeli venture capital funds over the next 18 months. The program features no intervention by the Authority in the investment considerations of the institutions or the venture capital fund managers, who will be able to invest the money according to their investment policy. The Authority will provide matching funding for institutional investments in Israeli venture capital funds under the program and will fully or partially waive its share of the returns from the investments in these funds, thereby increasing the returns for institutional investors from these investments. The program is state-funded and upside-oriented. At the chosen time, the institutional entity can \u201cbuy out\u201d the Authority. In the first four years from the day of the fund\u2019s investment, the institutional entity can buy the state\u2019s share at an annual compound interest rate of 1%, after the first four years, the institutional entity can buy out the Authority at a yearly compound interest rate of 5% (retroactively from the first day of the fund\u2019s investment). If the fund is loss-making, the Authority will bear the loss along with the institutional entity in proportion to its share of the investment. Additional incentives will be given to institutional entities investing in a venture capital fund that is primarily investing in deep-tech companies."
