        "body": "\u201cI\u2019m not particularly interested in looking at stories that are very black-and-white,\u201d says Skye Borgman. The award-winning director (Girl in the Picture, Abducted in Plain Sight) has earned a reputation for exploring the nuances of harrowing true crimes that are anything but straightforward. \u201cI like to be able to look at stories with various different layers and not necessarily give answers to things, but rather present a nuanced and a flawed perspective,\u201d she says. Borgman\u2019s latest docuseries American Nightmare: Laci Peterson applies this impartial gaze to one of the most high-profile cases of the early aughts. On Dec. 24, 2002, Laci Peterson disappeared from her home in Modesto, California. She was eight months pregant at the time. Her husband, Scott Peterson, reported her missing, claiming he\u2019d gone fishing at the Berkeley Marina that morning \u2014 Scott said when he returned home, Laci was gone. A massive search effort unfolded in the months following, involving countless volunteers, a headline-hungry media circus, and law enforcement growing increasingly skeptical of Scott\u2019s claims. Tragically, Conner Peterson\u2019s body was found on April 13, 2003, and Laci\u2019s remains were found nearby the next day. Both were discovered in the San Francisco Bay \u2014 less than two miles from the marina. Scott Peterson was arrested five days later and charged with two counts of murder. On Nov. 12, 2004, Peterson was found guilty of first-degree murder for Laci\u2019s death, and second-degree murder for Conner\u2019s death. Scott Peterson was sentenced to death in 2005, but in 2020 the California Supreme Court overturned his death sentence, citing errors in the jury selection process. The court left Peterson\u2019s conviction intact, and he was resentenced to life without parole. And whether you\u2019re unfamiliar with Peterson\u2019s story or followed along as it unfolded,\u00a0American Murder: Laci Peterson presents a clear-eyed reexamination of the case. \u201cCrime has all of these different facets of human nature,\u201d Borgman says. \u201cThat\u2019s what really draws me to some of these stories \u2014 the opportunity to paint that picture in all the different shades we\u2019ve got in our box of crayons.\u201d Here, the documentarian tells Tudum how she worked with friends and family of both Laci and Scott to craft a series that allowed both sides to share their truths. How has your interest in Laci Peterson\u2019s disappearance evolved over the years? At the time, in the early 2000s, I was very interested in it and was following along with it quite closely, and then it kind of went away. I didn\u2019t hear so much about Scott and Laci. It started sort of rumbling and infiltrating the news in the past two or three years, I think \u2014 I was seeing things about appeals for Scott, and that\u2019s when I started paying attention again. Then, when the opportunity to do this series came up, I started looking and diving a little bit deeper into research. True crime continues to grow with each passing year. What are the elements of a case that make you want to create work examining it? I\u2019m always fascinated by women\u2019s issues. Issues that are specific to women can sort of bleed over with men, too, but women\u2019s issues are always very important to me. I also like really layered stories. I\u2019m not particularly interested in looking at stories that are very black-and-white. I don\u2019t know that those stories really exist \u2014 I always think there\u2019s a history that brings a story to a certain place or something that isn\u2019t being told. There are so many series and documentaries about the Laci Peterson case. How did you think about positioning your work within that broader landscape? You know, I\u2019m honestly not thinking about how mine stacks up to other documentaries that are out there. I\u2019m really looking \u2026 to find something that is compelling to me. I want to find the story and what it is that speaks to me about it. In this particular case, I feel like Laci, and Conner to an extent, have kind of been overshadowed by a lot of the stories that are out there, and I really wanted to have Laci be in the forefront of this story. How do you persuade people to discuss in detail some of the most difficult events of their lives? I\u2019m always approaching participants from a baseline of being truthful with them. I never want to go in, promise something, and then deliver on something else, because I feel like that\u2019s totally [the] opposite of everything I try to do with the work I do. I also feel like my approach to documentaries is to really hear all of the facts from all of the different sides and put those facts out there. I\u2019m never trying to do \u201cgotcha\u201d interviews. I\u2019m always trying to put forward what would be good about telling their side of the story, how it\u2019s going to impact the documentary, how it\u2019s going to sort of work into the storyline. That\u2019s how I talked to potential participants about what their participation means to the story. There\u2019s a moment in the docuseries when Laci\u2019s mother, Sharon Rocha, stops speaking mid-statement and seems to be overwhelmed with emotion. When those things happen, what does it look like between those pauses and the next shot? It\u2019s always different, and it happens a lot. It happens a lot that people just need to take a break. Usually what I find when people need to take a break or step away is that the emotions are just there, sort of overpowering them. They need to do something to kind of feel centered again, and so I just give them the space to do that. Especially with Sharon, I wanted her to feel good about sitting in the chair and what she was telling us. What ended up happening that day is she stepped away, we took a 20- or 30-minute break. We talked to her a little bit, and then she was ready to come back and tell the rest of her story. Did you originally plan to include Scott Peterson in the series? It\u2019s interesting, because I was on the fence about whether or not we wanted to have Scott in there. We absolutely reached out to him, and we were in communication with him. He ultimately decided not to participate in the documentary, but I was always kind of like: \u201cDo we want his voice? Do we not want his voice?\u201d And so when he decided not to participate, it wasn\u2019t a big blow to us in any sense. I was perfectly happy with it. In the series, it\u2019s mentioned that a number of women escaped cycles of intimate-partner violence because of learning about what happened to Laci Peterson. As true crime grows in popularity, there\u2019s a tension between the potential harm of dwelling on these stories versus the potential benefits of continuing to share them. How do you think about the push and pull of telling stories like Laci\u2019s? Gloria Gomez talks in the film about the media circus and our role in it. It\u2019s my role, too. It\u2019s your role in doing this interview, in telling these stories. I think it\u2019s always a matter of calibration, and I think it\u2019s always a matter of not tipping the scales to a point where it\u2019s an unethical or a Wild West sort of approach, but rather looking at them in a journalistic way and keeping journalism at the forefront of how we tell these stories, being really truthful to the facts and being truthful to the participants \u2014 and to an extent, being truthful to ourselves. The Laci Peterson story, it\u2019s incredibly relevant to today\u2019s audience, because this is something that continues to happen. It\u2019s a very, very detailed, evidence-based look at how Laci Peterson disappeared and how Scott Peterson was convicted. Something that I came to realize throughout the making of this piece is that it really is a documentary about family. It has so many different facets of what a family looks like and what a family is, what a family goes through and what a family believes in \u2014 from Laci\u2019s family and how they reacted and responded to how they\u2019ve healed and how they\u2019ve dealt with trauma, to Scott\u2019s family and how they responded and how they\u2019ve healed and dealt with this trauma and the breakup of the Peterson family. You can look at families and have the very best and the very worst. I think, ultimately, this series is a three-part documentary that really looks at what a family can and can\u2019t be. What do you hope audiences take away from\u00a0American Murder: Laci Peterson? There\u2019s this statistic that is shocking to me every time I hear it \u2014 homicide is the No. 1 cause of death for pregnant women. Every time I say that to people, they tell me absolutely that can\u2019t be true, but it is. And I think we\u2019re able to forget that. Intimate partner violence is something that\u2019s really overwhelming. I want people to walk away from this thinking about that in a deeper way. Watch American Murder: Laci Peterson on Netflix now."

And here to welcome you to The Cut\u2019s own Kildare County surf shop are the Pogues themselves \u2014 John B (Chase Stokes), Sarah (Madelyn Cline), JJ (Rudy Pankow), Kiara (Madison Bailey), Pope (Jonathan Daviss), and Cleo (Carlacia Grant). Check out the commercial above (written and directed by Daviss!) for the one-stop shop for all your island essentials built by Pogues for Pogues (and some Kooks!), on the old Maybank property. Want to schedule a scuba and surf tour with JJ or a custom surfboard design session with Kie? The surf shop is coming to the OBX this fall! While one chapter of the Pogues\u2019 story has closed, the next phase of #P4L has only just begun, and the hunt for Blackbeard\u2019s gold is on the horizon. Here\u2019s everything we know so far about the upcoming fourth season. Yes. The Pogues have kicked off their flip-flops (and hopped in the shower) because Season 4 filming has officially finished. \u201cIt has been a crazy, crazy journey,\u201d says Stokes. \u201cBut it\u2019s done.\u201d And now that they\u2019re \u201cwrapski,\u201d the Pogues are game to get in on the post production. Check out the video above to see Grant try her hand at ocean sound effects and Daviss jump on the computer to edit. Jokes aside, they\u2019re all \u201cso stoked\u201d to bring Season 4 to the fans. Now we just have to count down the days of post production (hopefully minus any Pogue input), and we\u2019ll be back on Kildare Island before we know it. The gang was back on Kildare Island \u2014 with the Twinkie \u2014 \u00a0from June 2023. Watch the cast say \u201c#P4L\u201d from set in the clip at the top of this article, which Stokes premiered live at Tudum: A Global Fan Event in 2023. Check out behind-the-scenes photos of them on set. At none other than Poguelandia, of course! In February 2023, Poguelandia took over Huntington Beach, California, with an immersive fan event, re-creating the Pogues\u2019 island paradise. All the Pogues took to the stage with a couple of the kookiest\u00a0Kooks \u2014 Drew Starkey and Austin North \u2014 at Poguelandia to drop the news that Season 4 is on the way \u2026 all before Season 3 had even arrived. Sitting on the edge of the stage, Stokes told the crowd that they were the first to know that \u201cOuter Banks has been renewed for a fourth season!\u201d He took a moment to thank the fans for sticking with John B, the Pogues, and even the Kooks for three and a half years. \u201cThis is an incredible moment for all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cTo our cast and crew, thank you so much for all of your hard work.\u201d Last we saw of the Pogues in the Season 3 finale,18 months had passed since they found the gold in El Dorado. They were still grappling with the deaths of both Ward (Charles Esten) and Big John (Charles Halford), but were actually taking a moment to process their hard-won victory. After all, \u201cthey couldn\u2019t completely lose the third season,\u201d co-creator Shannon Burke previously told Tudum. Co-creator Josh Pate added, \u201cWe knew we needed to give them a win, but it ended up being a complicated one. We wanted the audience to feel that they had accomplished something and that it wasn\u2019t all for nothing.\u201d With the stakes higher than ever in Season 3, the creative minds behind Outer Banks, executive producers and creators Jonas Pate, Josh Pate, and Burke, told Tudum they hoped fans would really feel the strength of the Pogues\u2019 friendship in Season 3. \u201cThere\u2019s all this action and adventure, but it\u2019s really about the bond between the friends,\u201d Burke said. But most importantly, Josh Pate wanted all the wannabe Pogues watching at home to feel \u201cthe sense that there\u2019s more coming.\u201d What would OBX be without the Pogues coming back for their next adventure? Returning series regulars are Stokes as John B, Cline as Sarah, Bailey as Kiara, Daviss as Pope, Pankow as JJ, Grant as Cleo, North as Topper, and Starkey as Rafe. In addition, Fiona Palomo will return as Sofia and has been upped to series regular. But wait, there\u2019s more! Here are all the new (tanned) faces you can expect to meet in Outer Banks Season 4: The Pogues will wash back up on shore in fall 2024. In the meantime, relive the past three seasons of Outer Banks now on Netflix \u2014 and keep coming back to Tudum to learn when the Pogues\u2019 new adventure begins this year.

This six-episode spy thriller starring Keira Knightley (The Imitation Game, Love Actually) and Ben Whishaw (This Is Going to Hurt, A Very English Scandal) as an unlikely spy/assassin duo will offer up high-stakes global intrigue as well as plenty of British wit, knife fights, and holiday (or anti-holiday?) cheer.

One that links the murky underworld of London to a looming geopolitical crisis \u2014 and leads them to question the cost of the moral choices they\u2019ve made. At the press event Next on Netflix UK on March 14, Knightley summed up the series best: \u201cBlack Doves is a very exciting spy thriller set at Christmas in London.\u201d The series is created and written by Joe Barton. \u201cI started writing the scripts for this show over last year\u2019s Christmas holidays, fueled by turkey sandwiches and discarded bottles of cream liquor,\u201d Barton told Netflix in October 2023. \u201cTo be now going into production with a cast and crew full of people whose work I admire so much is unbelievably exciting, and I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to get to see this show come to life.\u201d The series is directed by Alex Gabassi (The Crown) and Lisa Gunning (The Power). Executive producers are Barton, Jane Featherstone (Chernobyl, This Is Going To Hurt), Chris Fry (Kaos, Giri/Haji) for SISTER, and Knightley. Harry Munday serves as producer. Black Doves will land on Netflix later this year. Check back for more top-secret news. Yes!

        "body": "In the age of superficial swiping, everlasting love is hard to find \u2014 and even harder to hold onto. Hmm, if only there was an experiment that cut through the noise and streamlined practically everything about modern dating\u2026 Bringing soulmates together since 2020, Love Is Blind has strived to help countless singles around the country (and now, the world) on the hunt for their happily ever. How? Well, the relationships forged are based on purely emotional connections, as the couples get engaged without ever laying eyes on each other. From the pods to the altar and beyond, everyone who enters the experiment embarks on a life-changing journey to discover whether love is truly blind. While the participants, cities, and even the glowing blue wall may have changed over time, the answer remains the same: yes. And we have the love stories to prove it, as many of the couples who\u2019ve said \u201cI do\u201d (and one who took an even more, well, unconventional approach) have gone the distance. So who\u2019s still together all these years later? Read below to check back in with every single U.S.-based couple starting from Season 1 to Season 6 to see where they stand today. After feeling an instant spark in the pods, Lauren and Cameron were the first to get engaged. They eventually tied the knot and are still living their happily ever after. In November, the couple rang in their five-year anniversary by renewing their vows in Las Vegas.\u00a0\u201cEvery day feels like I fall more and more in love with Cam, which I didn\u2019t even know was possible,\u201d Lauren said at the time. The two regularly gush about their romance on social media, as well as on their YouTube channel, Hangin\u2019 with the Hamiltons, where they answer questions about their relationship and give fans updates about what their lives look like now. Lauren also offered her take on the journeys that unfolded in subsequent Love Is Blind chapters as a co-host of Seasons 1 and 2 of the We Have the Receipts podcast. In an Instagram post, Cameron shared a picture for Lauren\u2019s birthday, writing, \u201cYou have shown me a depth of love I didn\u2019t know existed. I\u2019m so grateful you were born and that you chose to spend this life with me, through the storms and the sunshine. You make this world brighter.\u201d All these years later, Amber and Barnett are still going strong. Ever since the couple said \u201cI do,\u201d they have continued to revel in their love and celebrate life together. The couple reached a major milestone in November, as they too marked their five-year anniversary. \u201c5 years later and somehow I really do love you more today than the day we said \u2018I do,\u2019\u201d Amber wrote on Instagram alongside a photo from their wedding day. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, every day hasn\u2019t been perfect and Lord knows there is plenty that we have gotten wrong over the years, but the most important thing that I\u2019m so thankful that we\u2019ve gotten right is how much we are willing to work for each other to keep growing together.\u201d Barnett responded in kind with a sweet post of his own, thanking her for \u201cbeing my rock, and laughing at my poor attempts at trying to be funny,\u201d among other things. \u201cHere's to a lifetime of more questionable decisions, crazy adventures, and acting like adults when we are just kids in fancy clothes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHappy 5th Anniversary to the love of my life!\u201d After their very first date, Brennon knew Alexa was the one, but the two decided to stay in the experiment to experience the full \u201cmagic\u201d of the pods. The couple went on to tie the knot in a beautiful wedding and now they\u2019ve been married for over two years. \u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely amazing. I recommend marriage to everybody,\u201d Alexa tells Tudum. \u201cFind your person, find your one. Don\u2019t get married to just\u00a0anybody.\u201d Married life has only brought the pair closer, as Alexa says the transition has been \u201cnatural,\u201d while Brennon is simply happy he has half a closet to himself in their second bedroom. \u201cWe made a deal when we got married that anytime we\u2019re going out, she gets to dress me because... I don\u2019t have good fashion sense,\u201d Brennon jokes. \u201cAnd then anytime our wedding song comes on, she has to dance with me.\u201d The song is \u201cHeaven\u201d by Kane Brown, and Alexa and Brennon stop whatever they\u2019re doing to slow dance when they hear it. Yes \u2014 even if they\u2019re driving. (They pull over and sway by the side of the road if necessary.) Alexa and Brennon have had babies on the mind from the start, and in January, their wishes came true: The pair are currently expecting their first child together. The path, however, hasn\u2019t exactly been easy. Alexa revealed at the Season 6 reunion that she experienced fertility issues. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure it was ever going to happen for us,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have our love be physical in a baby.\u201d Brennan calls Alexa his \u201crock\u201d throughout the process, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional journey for both of us.\u201d Colleen and Matt are still on the same page \u2014 and now they finally live under the same roof. After years of living apart following their nuptials in Season 3, the couple have moved in together. At the Season 6 reunion, the duo were more than happy to announce that they\u2019ve taken the plunge. \u201cWe have moved in together into a beautiful town home,\u201d Colleen says. The process took longer than they both expected, as Colleen says they \u201cweren\u2019t money-wise ready\u201d to give up their leases at the time. Both explain their lease schedules didn\u2019t initially line up properly, and Colleen didn\u2019t want to \u201cscrew over\u201d her roommates by abandoning them. So they decided instead to spend all week together \u2014 \u201cbesides Monday, laundry day,\u201d Colleen jokes \u2014 between their two places. As Colleen and Matt say, they got married in an \u201cunorthodox\u201d way \u2014 so they\u2019re doing marriage in a similarly \u201cunorthodox\u201d manner. But now they\u2019ve entered a different phase of married life as they settle into their home together in Dallas. In other news, Colleen has continued to focus on her dance career, with Matt sharing that she recently starred as Princess Aurora in a production of Sleeping Beauty. \u201cIt was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve seen in my entire life,\u201d he says. In the words of the incomparable Lee Ann Womack, Zack and Bliss haven\u2019t lost that sense of wonder for each other. Since tying the knot after Zack\u2019s short-lived engagement to Irina, he and Bliss have settled into life as husband and wife. In fact, Zack says that he\u2019s \u201cso much more in love with Bliss than I ever was when we got married.\u201d For Bliss, their unprecedented, bumpy courtship unfolded exactly how it was supposed to. \u201cHe\u2019s such a good man,\u201d she tells Tudum. \u201cHe tried to follow through on his word and, even though it was a mistake, he was going to try to go at it with respect and care.\u201d After splitting time between each other\u2019s places, they\u2019re now living in Zack\u2019s apartment in Seattle, with plans of finding a bigger home together in the future. While Zack says he\u2019s never lived with anyone before, Bliss says cohabitating has been remarkably \u201ceasy,\u201d especially given his habit of cooking for her every night. And they\u2019ve got the support of married friends, like Kwame and Chelsea, whom they hang out with frequently. Looking ahead, both are on the same page when it comes to their next steps, which include planning their much-delayed European honeymoon, buying a home together, and expanding their family. In November 2023, they announced that they are expecting a child together. \u201cFor those of you who might not know, we\u2019re having a baby girl,\u201d the couple shared via video at the Season 6 reunion. And they\u2019ll have the support of the pod squad on their journey into parenthood, as Kwame, Chelsea, Tiffany, Brett, and Marshall, among others, were all in attendance at their recent baby shower. The couple welcomed their first child together \u2014 a baby girl named Galileo Terri Rayne \u2014 in April 2024. \"We are so in love with our precious, beautiful baby girl,\" they told People at the time. \"We are forever changed and are so blessed to spend the rest of our lives loving her. She is our moon, our stars, the center of our universe.\" Directly following Season 4, Kwame and Chelsea said married life has \u201cnot been easy,\u201d but they were staying focused on \u201cfinding happiness in the little things.\u201d Their first step as husband and wife was moving into a new apartment in Seattle once Kwame agreed to leave Portland. As they\u2019ve blended friends, families, and lifestyles, both agree that there\u2019s been \u201ca lot of growth and lots of growing pains\u201d so far. \u201cThis is a marriage. We are real people,\u201d Chelsea tells Tudum. \u201cWe have jobs, we have stressors, and the speed of this process is intense.\u201d The couple is moving at a relatively steady pace when it comes to building a relationship with Kwame\u2019s mother, who didn\u2019t initially approve of their marriage. Since the experiment ended, Kwame and his mother are \u201cgetting to a better place every day\u201d and have taken taken major steps, including his mother\u2019s first visit with Chelsea. \u201cMy mom first had to be OK with me making this decision before she would think, \u2018OK, now let me accept this whole new person into my family,\u2019 \u201d he says. Chelsea, meanwhile, has learned to \u201chave a lot of grace for [Kwame\u2019s mother] and for her journey,\u201d given how their nontraditional love story is \u201cunknown to that generation.\u201d The good news? Chelsea\u2019s become best friends with Kwame\u2019s sister, who she says has been a \u201cgift\u201d to their family and a \u201cbuffer to this experience with [Kwame\u2019s] mom.\u201d Looking ahead, Chelsea and Kwame feel hopeful about \u201cputting together all of these pieces\u201d into the \u201cmassive puzzle\u201d that is their future. \u201cThis has been transformative,\u201d Chelsea says. \u201cWe\u2019ve both grown so much and we\u2019re really, really proud of where we are now and the foundation that we\u2019ve built.\u201d Life has only gotten sweeter since then, with Chelsea changing jobs, granting the couple some long-awaited flexibility. In fact, Chelsea now helps cast Love Is Blind, which she can do from just about anywhere. \u201cI get to talk to brave, bold, courageous singles all over the United States that may make the leap that we all did,\u201d she says at the Season 6 reunion. As for Kwame, he shares that Chelsea has \u201cbonded really closely\u201d with his nieces and nephews during their trips to the East Coast. \u201cWe\u2019re doing great,\u201d Chelsea adds. \u201cWe are so proud and happy after almost two years of marriage.\u201d Tiffany and Brett\u2019s happily ever after began with her moving into his Portland, Oregon, apartment, which she notes now has room for both of their shoe collections. While married life is not without its hiccups, both agree that their \u201crelationship has only gotten stronger\u201d since we last saw them at the altar. \u201cI love that my love for him has just grown deeper and deeper,\u201d she tells Tudum. \u201cI wake up every morning and I\u2019m just so thankful. Like, oh my gosh, I\u2019m still pinching myself that I found him on a TV show.\u201d Brett, for one, has been surprised at just how well their lives have continued to meld, as Tiffany\u2019s tried to establish her own friendships, while building relationships with his \u201ccore group.\u201d When they\u2019re not traveling around the country or visiting Brett\u2019s family in North Carolina, life for these newlyweds is \u201cvery normal,\u201d he says, and includes a once-a-week date night minimum. Communication around any issues that do arise is key, but the couple has found a way of resolving them by, as they say, \u201cmaking sure that we\u2019re working to be better people for each other.\u201d \u201cUltimately, we\u2019ve been doing as great as we could\u2019ve ever hoped to have been doing at this point in time,\u201d says Brett. \u201cI\u2019m happy. I\u2019m very happy.\u201d Since then, the couple\u2019s bond has only gotten stronger \u2014 Tiffany shares at the Season 6 reunion that Brett is \u201cdoing great\u201d as a husband. She also reveals that they have plans to travel to Japan in the coming months before putting down roots in Portland. \u201cWe\u2019re actually looking for homes right now,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be our first home, so I\u2019m excited to get that started.\u201d Since their Season 5 nuptials, Milton and Lydia are stronger than ever. \u201cMarriage has been great. It\u2019s so nice to have that person, that best friend who is going to be there for you,\u201d Lydia tells Tudum. \u201cWe have each other\u2019s back and that is something that you cannot put a price on.\u201d These days they are focused on their future and building a life together as husband and wife. Right now, that\u2019s meant navigating career changes, as both have landed new jobs since the wedding. Milton has stepped into a managerial role at a new company, which provides a better work-life balance (and pays for his graduate school education). \u201cHe started school this week and he asks me, \u2018Babe, do you think this is right or not?\u2019\u201d Lydia says. \u201cHe knows, yes, my wife is smart and she can help me, which makes me feel fulfilled because I can be useful.\u201d Meanwhile Lydia is making her own career moves in a new job where she can flex her social skills. \u201cI\u2019m a social person, so having that human interaction is key [for] my motivation aspect and career development,\u201d she says. But what hasn\u2019t changed is the rock-solid foundation of their relationship, which has been tested time and time again. \u201c[Milton] loves me purely for who I am, as I love him,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cThe other day I was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is a lot,\u2019 and he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, at the end of the day we got each other.\u2019 \u201d Amy and Johnny are basking in the glow of both commitment and compromise after tying the knot. Since we last saw them, the two say their love has \u201ckept growing and growing\u201d over their first year of marriage. \u201cWhen I look back at [the experiment], I love her so much more now than in the pods or when we were first married,\u201d Johnny tells Tudum. Amy adds that they both have \u201cgrown so much as individuals and as a couple.\u201d The first step? Moving in together. \u201cHe paid to break my lease and then we just went into it,\u201d says Amy. Family ties have only strengthened their bond, as their respective broods have \u201cclicked perfectly\u201d ever since the wedding. \u201cMy family is\u00a0obsessed with John. My dad and him are bros and they call [each other] all the time,\u201d Amy shares. \u201cIt\u2019s the relationship that I always wanted for my dad to have with my husband.\u201d Johnny accompanied Amy\u2019s loved ones on a trip to France, and she later spent the holidays with his family. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice being able to just go to her parents\u2019 house, see her family, and just have that community over there,\u201d Johnny adds. As for starting their own family one day, the two say they\u2019re in a \u201ccontinuous conversation\u201d about having children three to five years from now. \u201cI am still firm on my stance that I don\u2019t want any birth control at the moment, but that\u2019s something that can change in the future,\u201d Amy explains. \u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m going to end up [using] some sort of birth control.\u201d For now, the couple is most focused on strengthening their foundations before taking any major next steps. \u201cWe\u2019re still young and our relationship is still young, too, so we want to make sure that\u2019s going to be growing and flourishing before we welcome a child into this world,\u201d Johnny says. Jet Skiing off into the sunset was only the beginning of Jeramey and Sarah Ann\u2019s love story. After the pod squad barbecue, the two locked down their relationship and have been living together since October 2023. While the road to each other wasn\u2019t exactly traditional by\u00a0Love Is Blind\u00a0standards, Jeramey and Sarah Ann still consider themselves proof of the experiment\u2019s success. \u201cI fell in love with who Jeramey is as a person and we had a strong connection from the very beginning of this experiment,\u201d Sarah Ann says at the reunion. \u201cI don\u2019t think for a second that anything between us is fake.\u201d There have, however, been some bumps along the way for the duo. \u201cWe have gone through real-life relationship stuff since we have been together,\u201d Jeramey admits. \u201cWe did realize, fighting through things continuously, that we do love each other and we wanted to support each other through this process itself\u2026 and we\u2019re still fighting for that every day.\u201d Plus, receiving a \u201cton of hate on the Internet\u201d has seemingly only brought them closer, he says. Despite the highs and lows of their journey, the two believe that they were meant to find each other. \u201cI think this experiment does work,\u201d Sarah Ann says. \u201cI\u2019m sitting next to someone that I love with all my heart. In my pursuit of love, hearts got broken and I apologize for that. That\u2019s not what I wanted. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d"

        "body": "It\u2019s easy to lose track of people over time. How many of you have old friends, partners, even family members that you haven\u2019t spoken to in years? Who knows what they could be up to? In a new trailer for The Union, Mike (Mark Wahlberg) gets the opportunity to find out. When his high school ex-girlfriend, Roxanne (Halle Berry), reenters his life, she\u2019s had quite the career change \u2014 and soon, Mike is whisked off on a whirlwind adventure that turns his quiet working-class world upside down. \u201cWe always felt Roxanne had to be the love of this guy\u2019s life; he stayed where he was because he was hoping that she would actually come back into his life somehow,\u201d Wahlberg told Netflix. \u201cThey had a sort of forbidden high school relationship, and he\u2019d do anything to make her smile and anything to make her happy and to never let her out of his sight again. That\u2019s his entire motivation \u2013\u2013 her smile.\u201d Of course, Roxanne has a slightly different motivation; she\u2019s a member of The Union, a top secret and slightly unorthodox government agency. \u201cThe Union does the dirty work for the CIA and FBI,\u201d Berry told Netflix. \u201cWhen you really need the job done, you call in this group of people. They\u2019re blue-collar workers, everyday average people who get plucked by The Union to be trained to shoot and do combat intelligence and tactical weaponry.\u201d And Mike has just been recruited. It\u2019s a mission he\u2019ll never forget, and you\u2019re invited along for the ride. Get briefed on all the details below. Mike (Wahlberg) is happy living a simple life as a construction worker in his native New Jersey \u2013\u2013 until his long-lost high school sweetheart, Roxanne (Berry), shows up with more on her mind than romance. Knowing he\u2019s the right man for the job, she recruits Mike on a dangerous intelligence mission in Europe that thrusts them back together into a world of spies and high-speed car chases, with sparks flying along the way. Directed by Julian Farino (Giri/Haji, Entourage) from a script by Joe Barton and David Guggenheim, The Union also stars Mike Colter, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jessica De Gouw, Alice Lee, Jackie Earle Haley, and J.K. Simmons. The Union\u00a0came about after Wahlberg asked his longtime producing partner Stephen Levinson a simple question: \u201cWhat would it be like if we ever got to be the guy in the tuxedo? The super spy.\u201d Check it out at the top of this article! The Union is now streaming on Netflix. The Union\u2019s ensemble cast includes: Oscar nominee Mark Wahlberg plays Mike, a friendly New Jersey construction worker who\u2019s a little stuck. He lives with his mom, hooks up with his former high school teacher, and basically runs in place \u2014 until old flame Roxanne (Halle Berry) sweeps him off his feet (read: sedates him) and drags him into a world of adventure. Soon Mike will have to use all of his skills in service of a very different line of work.  Wahlberg drew from an unlikely source while building his character. \u201cMike has this unique skill set in that he doesn\u2019t really have any fear,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a steelworker, and you think of that iconic image of guys sitting on a beam 50 stories in the air, eating a sandwich like they\u2019re sitting on a curb.\u201d Of course, Wahlberg wasn\u2019t quite as casual about his stunts: \u201cTo go up there, even though you\u2019ve got a wire on, it\u2019s still pretty scary.\u201d The Departed, Boogie Nights, The Other Guys, Ted, The Fighter, The Italian Job, Daddy\u2019s Home, Deepwater Horizon Oscar-winner Halle Berry plays Roxanne, Mike\u2019s high school sweetheart, who\u2019s led quite a different life since they parted ways in their senior year. She\u2019s now a Union agent, a working-class spy without equal. And she needs Mike\u2019s help.  Berry loved the way The Union flipped the typical spy-movie gender dynamic on its head. \u201cRoxanne is a woman that has always dreamed of getting outside of her own backyard, which she did,\u201d Berry tells Tudum. \u201cWhat I love about her is that she\u2019s been relentless in her pursuit of her dreams, of her career, of her goals. And I also love that she goes back and she plucks Mike out of that world and dares him to dream a bigger dream for himself.\u201d Monster\u2019s Ball, X-Men, Die Another Day, Cloud Atlas, John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum, The Call, Swordfish Oscar-winner J.K. Simmons plays Tom Brennan, a former CIA agent turned Union man. He lets Roxanne run point on this operation \u2014 and keeps a weather eye on the inexperienced Mike.  \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Mark a couple of times, and I\u2019m a big fan,\" Simmons told Netflix. \"I hadn\u2019t worked with Halle, but I\u2019m also a big fan of her work. As always, it's about the script. It looked like a really fun popcorn movie with substance, some comedy, some action \u2014 and a really good ride. What I like about the film is that, with Julian at the helm, there's a balance between levity and still having some stakes, so it\u2019s not a cartoon.\u201d Whiplash, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Juno, Palm Springs, Up in the Air, Being the Ricardos, Thank You for Smoking Mike Colter is Nick Faraday, Roxanne\u2019s partner in life and work.  \u201cIt\u2019s intriguing because I think we all sit on our couches or all think to ourselves, \u2018What could we have done if we decided to do it?\u2019 \u201d Colter says of The Union\u2019s central wish-fulfillment concept. \u201cCould we have reached that potential? The Union looks at these people and tries to give them an opportunity to do that.\u201d Luke Cage, Plane, Girls Trip, Zero Dark Thirty, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Frank, The Union\u2019s physical specialist. He\u2019s a hardened combat veteran who puts Mike through his paces in training. Oz, The Bourne Identity, Suicide Squad, The Mummy Returns, The Thing (2011), Pompeii, Congo, Concussion Jessica De Gouw plays Juliet Quinn, the auctioneer whom The Union is trying to track down. Gretel & Hansel, These Final Hours, Underground, Operation Buffalo, The Secrets She Keeps, The Couple Next Door Alice Lee plays Athena, another member of The Union. She\u2019s full of vim, vigor, and wisecracks \u2014 which makes Mike\u2019s medical evaluation one to remember. Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist, My Adventures with Superman, Switched at Birth, Take Two, Gap Year Jackie Earle Haley plays the Foreman, The Union\u2019s technical whiz. His title isn\u2019t just a code name; before joining The Union, he was a foreman and forklift operator. Watchmen, Shutter Island, Breaking Away, The Bad News Bears, Lincoln, Alita: Battle Angel, Little Children Stephen Campbell Moore plays Cameron Foster, the Union\u2019s CIA counterpart. Like many at the Agency, he has a tendency to look down at the lunch-box types at The Union. Johnny English Reborn, Man Up, The Bank Job, Masters of the Air, Season of the Witch, Goodbye Christopher Robin Oscar-nominee Lorraine Bracco plays Mike\u2019s mom. She\u2019s got eyes everywhere. GoodFellas, The Basketball Diaries, Hackers, Riding in Cars with Boys, Sea of Love, The Pick-Up Artist, Medicine Man In the midst of all of The Union\u2019s action, the filmmakers wanted the connection between the two protagonists to stay in the spotlight. \u201cRoxanne and Mike\u2019s relationship is going to define the movie,\u201d Farino said. \u201cFor me, even the action in the movie was always about how to keep our characters integral to the explosions and fun and games.\u201d "

        "body": "Everyone has something to hide in the small town of Little Kilton, and Pippa Fitz-Amobi (Emma Myers) is going to get to the bottom of it all. In A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder \u2014 based on Holly Jackson\u2019s hugely successful YA mystery novel of the same name \u2014 Pip sets out to uncover the truth behind the mysterious murder of popular high school student Andie Bell (India Lillie Davies) five years earlier, and the apparent suicide of her boyfriend, Sal Singh (Rahul Pattni), who confessed to her murder. With the season\u2019s multiple overlapping investigations, and its various twists, turns, and surprising reveals, there\u2019s no way Pip could know what she\u2019s getting herself into when she teams up with Sal\u2019s brother, Ravi (Zain Iqbal), to reopen the case that continues to haunt their sleepy English town. And yet, the 17-year-old sleuth won\u2019t rest until she finds answers, for her school project and for herself. If you\u2019ve reached the end of the season\u2019s six episodes and are ready for a detective-style debrief, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Read on for all the juicy details about how this case unfolds. As her investigation unfolds, Pip discovers that Andie was having a secret relationship with an older man before she went missing. That \u201cSecret Older Guy\u201d turns out to be her English teacher and best friend\u2019s dad, Elliot Ward (Mathew Baynton). When Pip confronts Elliot about this, he reveals that Andie had threatened to tell everyone that he took advantage of her unless he gave her \u00a35,000 to help her run away from home. (She had initially saved up the money to leave home by selling drugs, but her father discovered the funds and took them from her.) When Elliot refused to give her the money, Andie became upset and he pushed her \u2014 causing her to fall and hit her head on the countertop. But before Elliot could call an ambulance, Andie had already left. After leaving Elliot\u2019s, Andie went back home where her younger sister, Becca (Carla Woodcock), confronted her about her plans to leave town with Sal. Becca was angry that Andie would leave her alone to deal with their controlling father, Jason (Matthew Chambers), and also resentful that her sister wouldn\u2019t come with her to the police to report that she had been drugged and raped by another student, Max Hastings (Henry Ashton). That\u2019s because Andie sold Max the drugs that he used to assault Becca. When the sisters fought that night, Becca pushed Andie \u2014 who had already suffered a serious head injury \u2014 into the wall, and watched as she fell to the floor and choked to death on her own vomit. Andie\u2019s boyfriend Sal was the primary suspect in her murder. When a text was sent from his phone confessing to killing her before he was found dead of an overdose, it was case closed for the police. But Pip, who teams up with Sal\u2019s brother Ravi to investigate the case, doesn\u2019t believe that Sal could have done this. As it turns out, there was more to the story. When Andie went missing after she confronted Elliot and attempted to blackmail him, he thought she had died of her head injury and was desperate for someone else to take the fall when her body turned up. So he came up with a plan to frame Sal for Andie\u2019s death. Elliot drugged and suffocated Sal, then sent the confession from Sal\u2019s phone and made it look like the teenager had killed himself. But the confession text is the first red flag for Pip and Ravi \u2014\u00a0who notice that, unlike the rest of Sal\u2019s messages, this one is written in perfect (dare we say, English teacher\u2013level perfect?) grammar. Two people, it turned out \u2014 the two people who have the most to lose if Pip discovered what really happened to Andie. The threatening \u201cSTOP DIGGING, PIPPA\u201d note that Pip finds in her sleeping bag during her best friend Cara Ward\u2019s (Asha Banks) birthday camping trip was left there by Cara\u2019s father, Elliot. But he isn\u2019t the same person who blackmails Pip via text. Those texts \u2014 including threats about the family dog, Barney \u2014 come from Becca. After sending threats to Pip about Barney, Becca kills the beloved family dog in retaliation to Pip posting a video on social media announcing that she would release all the findings of her investigation. Elliot blackmailed his older daughter, Naomi (Yasmin Al-Khudhairi), and her friend Max because he didn\u2019t want to be held responsible for Andie\u2019s death. So here\u2019s how it happened: Naomi and Max were involved in a hit-and-run on New Year\u2019s Eve, for which they never faced any consequences. As it turns out, Max made a call that night to police officer Dan Da Silva (Jackson Bews), who had a fling with Andie two years earlier when she was a minor. Max knew about the relationship and was using it as blackmail to force Dan into helping them cover up the car wreck. When Andie disappeared, Naomi and Max received a note instructing them to lie to the police about how long Sal was with them the night she went missing \u2013\u2013 otherwise, the blackmailer would tell the police about the hit-and-run. That note came from Elliot, who learned about the incident while reading Naomi\u2019s diary, and used the information to blackmail his daughter and Max into lying about Sal\u2019s alibi, making it seem like he was involved in Andie\u2019s murder. Naomi and Max told the police Sal left their group early the night Andie went missing, and covered their tracks by deleting any photos that proved otherwise \u2014 all but one. Naomi subtly points Pip towards a 2019 photo still up on Max\u2019s Instagram account, which shows the friends hanging out at 12:06 a.m. She later confirms to Pip that the photo was taken by Sal, thereby proving his innocence. When Pip tracks Elliot down to the Wards\u2019 old family home \u2014 which he lied about selling \u2014 to confront him about Sal, she hears someone banging on the pipes and rushes up to the attic. There, she finds a young woman named Isla (Georgia Lock) who tells Pip that Elliot saw her in the street one night while driving around and appeared relieved, presumably because he thought she was Andie, and brought her back to the house. She says that Elliot drunkenly revealed to her that he had killed Sal, and then locked her in the attic to prevent her from talking to the police. Thanks to Pip\u2019s quick thinking, she had Ravi send police to arrive at the home while she was there. Though she tries to convince herself that her reasons for investigating Andie\u2019s death aren\u2019t personal, even Pip has her own motives. It turns out that young Pip was one of the last people to see Andie at school before she went missing five years earlier. Andie gestured at a young Pip (Kitty Anderson) to be quiet as she passed in the hallway, but Pip pointed Sal in Andie\u2019s direction when he came looking for her. After Andie went missing, Pip couldn\u2019t live with herself knowing she had led Sal to Andie, which is one reason she refused to believe that Sal killed her. We learn later on that the meeting between Andie and Sal wasn\u2019t contentious at all \u2014 rather, the couple were making plans to leave town together. The season ends with Pip connecting all the dots and looking into one final loose end after Elliot\u2019s arrest: Becca Bell. She heads over to the Bell residence where Becca tells her what happened the night Andie died, and offers to take Pip to the woods to show her where she dumped her sister\u2019s body. But Pip doesn\u2019t realize until it\u2019s too late that Becca drugged her and intends to dispose of her, too. Luckily, Becca\u2019s plan is thwarted when Ravi and Cara track Pip down using a Find My Friends app and come to her rescue. As the season comes to a close, Pip finds herself at a turning point in more ways than one \u2014\u00a0questioning whether or not she actually wants to go to Cambridge, vowing to seek justice for anyone else Max has hurt, and sharing a sweet kiss with Ravi. What happens next for them, and everyone else in Little Kilton \u2026 well, that\u2019s the start of a new mystery, isn\u2019t it?"

        "body": "No matter what timeline the Brellies are in on The Umbrella Academy, you can always count on the writers to hide little treats for fans to find. \u201cWe really love to put Easter eggs into the show,\u201d creator, showrunner, and executive producer Steve Blackman tells Tudum. \u201cIt\u2019s something that the fans have always enjoyed every season,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo a lot of them we plan ahead of time, myself and the writers, of what fun things could we put in that either are callbacks to the graphic novel [the Dark Horse comic series, created by Gerard Way and illustrated by Gabriel B\u00e1] or callbacks to the show itself.\u201d In the video above, Blackman walks Tudum through key things fans might have missed from all four seasons of The Umbrella Academy. From references to Jennifer (Victoria Sawal) in every season to the parallels of Ben (Justin H. Min) and Viktor (Elliot Page) trying to save each other, catch all the Easter eggs from The Umbrella Academy now. We meet Gene and Jean in Season 4 as the founders of The Keepers, a \u201ccult-like\u201d support group for those who believe they\u2019re living in the wrong timeline. Their proof? A barn full of objects they\u2019ve collected from previous timelines. \u201cWe wanted to find a collection of things that the fans would easily recognize, so we actually picked things from all four seasons,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cThings from Hazel (Cameron Britton) and Cha-Cha (Mary J. Blige) [in Season 1], things that we saw in the farmhouse in Season 2, things from the Oblivion Hotel in Season 3, and some things from Season 4.\u201d When they first shot the barn scene, they actually didn\u2019t have enough artifacts featured. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is some of them were really there, but a lot of artifacts have been put in by VFX to even add more,\u201d says Blackman. The sign on the cover of the book was a fun callback to Season 1, as it was featured on the Meritech Prosthetics building. \u201cThat symbol is actually an old alchemy symbol, and the old alchemy symbols played with matter and how matter can be changed,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cWe wanted to play with the fact that this was a symbol that existed in two different timelines and also influenced the fact that matter could be changed in the magic subway that they take through timelines.\u201d \u201cThe Minerva is a much beloved flying machine that is from the graphic novel that the fans really love,\u201d says Blackman. It\u2019s actually what Sir Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) used to collect all of the children when he first collected them in the beginning of the graphic novel. \u201cSo it was important for us to see it a few times during the show. We get to see a small version of it in the pilot, but really we get to see the full Minerva in all its glory in Season 4, piloted by the amazing Pogo.\u201d \u201cWe all love Apocalypse Now, and we wanted Pogo to look badass,\u201d says Blackman. They went through different designs before landing on the final one. \u201cIt was such a timeless design of the \u201970s Vietnam-era pilot.\u201d They enlisted W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop, which did the design work in New Zealand, to put together a few different versions of it. \u201cUltimately, we picked the one that really, really matched Robert Duvall\u2019s character from the movie.\u201d In every timeline, Jennifer and Ben are always meant to be intertwined, so Blackman made sure to drop references to her throughout the series. \u201cThe Jennifer Incident is a huge part of the graphic novel. It\u2019s a story that basically defines Ben\u2019s death,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cSo it was very important that we tell that story, and I knew that I was going to tell it by the end of the season. So I wanted to pepper in through the seasons moments where the audience may or may not notice that they\u2019re seeing references to Jennifer.\u201d In every season, there are pictures on the wall that, if you look very closely, say \u201cJennifer,\u201d and you can\u2019t quite make out the face of the woman. There are other pieces in Ben\u2019s room, like scribbles that read \u201cJennifer\u201d in Season 2. In Season 3, Ben has all these drawings, and he can\u2019t quite figure out how the face should look. But he dreams about this woman, Jennifer. And then he finally meets her in Season 4. \u201cThe idea is that in all the timelines, he\u2019s destined to be pulled towards Jennifer. So if you go back, you\u2019ll see that Jennifer \u2014 her face, her name \u2014 exists in all of the seasons in different places throughout the academy.\u201d \u201cIn the Season 2 finale, Ben saves Viktor and we wanted to pay that off again in Season 4 and have Viktor saving Ben. We wanted to come full circle,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cWe found these two characters were in a way both outliers in the family, and it felt right that in this alternate timeline that one would save the other.\u201d Ben saving Viktor in the FBI office in Season 2 is one of Page\u2019s favorite memories from the series. \u201cWhat Ben does to save Viktor in this scene plays a huge part in why Viktor won\u2019t give up on Ben,\u201d Page told Netflix. In the Brellies\u2019 final scene, Viktor asks Allison if she feels strong enough to power up for the last time. Allison says, \u201cYeah, thanks El,\u201d as in Elliot Page\u2019s name, and not Viktor\u2019s. \u201cThat was Emmy Raver-Lampman just improvising,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t scripted, but I thought it was lovely.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to make the final moment really special and say that in this final timeline, things have all come back to normal. All the other timelines don\u2019t exist and it\u2019s just a normal life,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cSo we brought back in as many of the returning cast as we could.\u201d In the scene, you discover that Allison\u2019s daughter, Claire (Millie Davis), and Lila (Ritu Arya) and Diego\u2019s (David Casta\u00f1eda) family have survived. Showing up to film on the day was \u201ccrazy\u201d for Davis. \u201cWe had no idea what was going on! There were no sides, no script,\u201d she tells Tudum. \u201cThey were just like, \u2018OK you guys are all going to sit here and we\u2019re just going to press record while you sit and chat with each other.\u2019 \u201d As the camera moves away from the family, you can see the Swedes from Season 2, Hazel and Agnes (Sheila McCarthy), Grace (Jordan Claire Robbins) pushing a stroller, and the Handler (Kate Walsh) in the middle of a run. \u201cIt was so exciting to be a part of the beginning and the end of the story,\u201d Britton tells Tudum. Like Davis, he \u201cdidn\u2019t know until we got there that day what exactly we were doing, why, and the context for it.\u201d He considers it \u201cone of the cleverer endings I\u2019ve seen in a while.\u201d Robbins found that coming back was a beautiful way to finish the experience of working on the series. \u201cIt was cool because there were a lot of people I hadn\u2019t worked with, because our storylines didn\u2019t cross, that I got to be on set with that day. Like the Swedes!\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a really cool, very surreal, very fun last day.\u201d You can also spot B\u00e1 doing a drawing for Dot (Patrice Goodman) and Herb (Ken Hall) from the Commission. There are shots of B\u00e1\u2019s twin brother, F\u00e1bio Moon, sitting in the background, too. \u201cI hope people scream a little if they catch me there because it was fun for me,\u201d B\u00e1 tells Tudum. \u201cOur first idea was to make a cameo in Season 3, but it couldn\u2019t happen because of COVID. I was really happy to be part of that last episode.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s lots of things we threw in just for fun for the audience,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cThe crew and cast surprised me. One of the children is playing with a doll, and it looks exactly like me with my black hat, my jacket, and the Diet Coke that I usually have in my hand. So that was cute.\u201d Five\u2019s beloved mannequin, Dolores, is also just looking around a corner. \u201cThere\u2019s a few other surprises if you look really carefully,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cHe is such a fabulous artist,\u201d Blackman says of the illustrator of the comic series. \u201cSo it felt important to me to get something of his in every season.\u201d For the first season, B\u00e1 designed fake comic books for the show, including the cover of the issue in the first episode. He also worked on toys and merchandise for the series. They also asked him to design the tattoo that was on Pogo\u2019s arm in Season 3 and the Mothers of Agony patches that they wore on their bike jackets. In Season 4, B\u00e1 did some drawings that are scattered around different scenes, including Pogo\u2019s flight logo for the Minerva. And ultimately, he does the sketch in his cameo in the park scene. \u201cI enjoy just being part of it as little as that may be,\u201d says B\u00e1. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for me.\u201d The first appearance is in Season 1. \u201cIf you remember, Viktor has a book, My Extraordinary Life,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cIf you look at the reviews in the back when young Viktor\u2019s holding the book, you can see \u2018Reviewed by Gerard Way,\u2019 along with the other reviewers.\u201d The second reference is in Season 3, when Sloane (Genesis Rodriguez) reads a book called The Jetset Life. As Way is a member of the band My Chemical Romance, the book title was a callback to their song, \u201cThe Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You.\u201d Even though the references like his name as a reviewer feel \u201cso far back now\u201d for Way, he tells Tudum that \u201cthe cool little things they put in there like that\u201d are fun to see. \u201cWe all loved the movie The Shining, so we went ahead and we copied the carpet from the movie for the Overlook Hotel,\u201d says Blackman. Additionally, production wanted to be environmentally conscious when they built the hotel set. So the columns for the hotel are all made from recycled styrofoam \u2014 namely, Starbucks coffee cup holders. \u201cAll the walls are made from them, and there are thousands of them,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cBet you didn\u2019t know that one!\u201d In the series premiere, there\u2019s a sequence of how the children were mysteriously born to nonpregnant women across the world. Online, fans noticed \u201cthat the mural in the Russian pool house is a clear depiction of the Academy.\u201d And guess what? The fans were right. The kids portrayed in the mural \u2014 who are working together as a team \u2014 are intended to represent the seven members of the Umbrella Academy viewers are about to meet in the following scenes. You could call it the show\u2019s first Easter egg. \u201cThe Russian mural was one of our first times we wanted to incorporate something that the audience could pick up in the background very subtly,\u201d says Blackman.\u201d It was one of our first attempts to throw something in the background that the fans who are really paying attention might notice.\u201d In Season 2, Episode 8, Grace sees plans for a \u201cTelevator\u201d in Sir Reginald Hargreeves\u2019 office. In the comics, the Televator was invented by Hargreeves as an elevator lift that allows the team to travel in time, space, and even other dimensions. While most of the time travel in the TV series happens thanks to the Commission\u2019s briefcases or Five\u2019s abilities, the comic uses the Televator for time travel. Look for these Easter eggs (and more, if you can find them!) in all four seasons of The Umbrella Academy now, only on Netflix."

        "body": "So you\u2019re looking for a thrill? Well, let\u2019s be more specific. First off, you\u2019re definitely in the mood for a thriller, right? Not a horror situation? (If you want that, head\u00a0here.) While a thriller can be scary and horror can be thrilling, the difference between the two is right in the name. Horror films are predictably meant to horrify you with some evil that needs to be destroyed or at least escaped. Meanwhile, thrillers are\u00a0unpredictable, which is part of what builds the tension that\u2019s meant to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 thrill you. Now that\u2019s settled, let\u2019s talk types of thrillers. There are lots: psychological, mystery, high-stakes operation (think action, crime, legal, political, spy, sci-fi save-the-world stuff). If they\u2019re any good, all thrillers at some point become so heart-racing, so sweat-inducing, so completely captivating that you don\u2019t dare pause them \u2014 even though you\u2019ve\u00a0really\u00a0had to pee for the last seven minutes. Those are the thrillers worth your time \u2014 and worth making this list. So, because it wouldn\u2019t be fair to hold you in suspense, here are 13 of the best thrillers you can stream right now. (Bladders, be warned.) Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Apocalyptic There\u2019s no going back to normal in this apocalyptic thriller. Amanda Sandford (Julia Roberts) and her husband, Clay (Ethan Hawke), take their kids on a weekend family getaway to a gorgeous house on Long Island to escape the city buzz. But their vacation bliss is soon interrupted when the homeowner, G.H. Scott (Mahershala Ali), and his daughter, Ruth (Myha\u2019la),\u00a0arrive in the middle of the night seeking to hunker down in the midst of citywide blackouts in New York City. G.H. believes that the phenomenon might be a sign of something bigger, and the two families must learn to trust each other if they have any hope of surviving. 2023  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Romantic An ambitious power couple fight their way up the corporate ladder, but can their relationship survive? Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) are a pair of newly engaged financial analysts whose relationship is forbidden by their mutual employer,\u00a0cutthroat hedge fund One Crest Capital. When Emily gets an unexpected promotion that Luke expected for himself, power games between the two begin to tear their relationship apart. Only one person can come out on top, even if it ruins their future together. 2023  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Crime In this twisty thriller, hardened detective Tom Nichols (Benicio Del Toro) is thrown into a murder investigation after a young real estate agent is found dead at one of her listings. The young woman\u2019s boyfriend, Will Grady (Justin Timberlake), who\u2019s the head of his family\u2019s real estate empire, is completely devastated by her death, but something is amiss \u2014\u00a0and Nichols\u2019 investigation into the case leads him to a web of corruption that begins to unravel his whole life. Come for the mystery, stay for Alicia Silverstone\u2019s performance as Tom\u2019s wife, Judy, who is, in some ways, his most trusted partner. 2023  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Sci-Fi Mystery Seo-yeon (Park Shin-hye) returns to her childhood home on her way to visit her sick and estranged mother. When she arrives at the house, she connects an old phone and begins to receive calls from a distressed woman named Yeong-sook (Jun Jong-seo). During their calls, Seo-yeon realizes Yeong-sook is living in the same house \u2014 but 20 years ago. The two women become friends, learning about each other\u2019s lives over the phone while communicating across time. Then one day, Seo-yeon and Yeong-sook make a small choice that will forever change their lives in their respective timelines. But can they trust each other? 2020  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Postapocalyptic When someone tells you, \u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d fighting the urge becomes almost impossible. But in\u00a0Bird Box, it\u2019s a matter of life or death. Based on a 2014 novel with the same name, this 2018 film follows Malorie Hayes (Sandra Bullock) on a journey of survival. The world is overrun with off-camera entities that cause anyone who looks at them to commit suicide. We meet Malorie as she\u2019s instructing two children (Vivien Lyra Blair and Julian Edwards) to float down a river blindfolded, but then quickly jump back five years to a pregnant Malorie and her visiting sister (Sarah Paulson). A news broadcast warns that unexplained mass suicides are spreading and things are,\u00a0ahem, not looking good. As Malorie fights for her life, she encounters friends and enemies \u2014 including Tom (Trevante Rhodes), Olympia (Danielle Macdonald), Greg (BD Wong), Douglas (John Malkovich), Lucy (Rosa Salazar), and Felix (Machine Gun Kelly). And while none of them are supposed to open their eyes in the monsters\u2019 presence,\u00a0you won\u2019t be able to look away. 2018  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Psychological Ray Monroe (Sam Worthington) and his wife, Joanne (Lily Rabe), are arguing on a drive home when their daughter, Peri (Lucy Capri), interrupts them from the back seat, needing a bathroom break and new batteries for her music player.

Suddenly, a stray dog shows up and threatens to attack. By this time, Ray has found his daughter, but when he attempts to scare the dog away by throwing a rock, Peri falls backward into the hole. Trying to grab Peri, Ray falls in too and hits his head. When he comes to, he decides to take Peri to get checked out at a hospital they passed a few miles back. Dr. Berthram (Stephen Tobolowsky) decides Peri needs a CAT scan and sends mother and daughter downstairs for the procedure, while Ray is asked to remain in the waiting area, where he soon falls asleep. When Ray wakes up, not only has his family still not returned, but the hospital has no record of them. At all. Ever. 2019  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Action Adventure Russell Core (Jeffrey Wright) is a writer slash wolf expert who\u2019s been called to investigate the disappearance of three small children in the fictional town of Keelut, Alaska. As you may have guessed from Core\u2019s credentials, Medora Slone (Riley Keough) is convinced wolves are to blame for taking her 6-year-old son, Bailey. Meanwhile, Medora\u2019s husband, Vernon (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd), is serving overseas in Iraq until an injury and a missing Bailey bring him home. The police, led by Chief Donald Marium (James Badge Dale), and native villagers, like Vernon\u2019s friend, Cheeon (Julian Black Antelope), get involved in the search and form their own opinions as to what\u2019s going on in their small community. As this grisly and suspense-filled tale unfolds, it becomes increasingly difficult to gauge who\u2019s capable of the more savage behavior \u2014 animals or humans. 2018  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Action Drama Nothing creates tension like nuclear weapons. Terrorists have stolen nukes from Russia and taken over one of the United States\u2019 interceptor missile launch sites in Alaska. After she files a sexual misconduct report and becomes the subject of even more harassment from her military peers because of it, Army Captain JJ Collins (Elsa Pataky) is re-stationed to the middle of the Pacific Ocean at the only\u00a0other US interceptor missile launch site. Working in the command center alongside Lt. Colonel Marshall (Rhys Muldoon), Beaver Baker (Aaron Glenane) and Corporal Rahul Shah (Mayen Mehta), Collins is there when the station is infiltrated by ex-military intelligence soldier Alexander Kessel (Luke Bracey) and his group of baddies. They bring a manifesto to stream online about the failures of the US and instructions for those other bad guys in Alaska to launch the seized warheads immediately. As her country\u2019s last line of defense, Collins has other make-\u2019em-up-as-she-goes plans. There\u2019s also a cameo from Pataky\u2019s real-life husband, Chris Hemsworth, if that\u2019s the kind of thing that gets your heart beating fast. 2022  Thriller subgenre: Crime Idris Elba\u2019s DCI John Luther and his classic tweed coat are back, and you\u2019ll be on the edge of your seat as he tracks down a sadistic serial killer. In this reimagining of the award-winning series from Luther creator Neil Cross and director Jamie Payne, Luther finds himself in jail due to his years of rule-bending in the name of pursuing justice \u2014 that is, until he breaks himself out so he can crack the case of an unsolved murder. So begins a twisted game of cat and mouse between the detective and the cyber killer taunting him (played by a fantastically creepy Andy Serkis). The Fallen Sun has some familiar faces (like Dermot Crowley as Luther\u2019s former boss and friend, Detective Superintendent Martin Schenk) and new stars (including Cynthia Erivo\u2019s DCI Odette Raine), along with action-packed sequences that are sure to surprise even the most seasoned crime-thriller aficionados. 2023  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Psychological Sci-Fi Speaking of drugs,\u00a0Spiderhead tells the story of inmates Jeff (Miles Teller) and Lizzy (Jurnee Smollett), looking to reduce their sentences by volunteering as test subjects for various mood- and mind-altering chemicals in a fancy-schmancy penitentiary. The prisoners have their own rooms and are free to roam without guard supervision, as long as they show up for their daily test runs of the drugs. These are administered by the likable Steve Abnesti (Chris Hemsworth) and his dutiful assistant, Mark (Mark Paguio). But oh ho ho, nothing is ever as it seems in places like this, and\u00a0Jeff and Lizzy soon realize something much more sinister than a \u201clove drug\u201d is being developed here. Based on a\u00a0dystopian short story by George Saunders, once published inThe New Yorker, you\u2019ll be addicted from start to finish. 2022  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Psychological The lengths people will go to for a nice apartment these days... in the case of Javier Mu\u00f1oz (Javier Guti\u00e9rrez), they\u2019re downright terrifying.

He\u2019s forced to leave his stunning rich-person abode with wife Marga (Ruth D\u00edaz)\u00a0 and son Dani (Cristian Mu\u00f1oz) and downsize to a cramped rental unit in a poorer part of Barcelona. Marga tries to soften the blow with the observation, \u201cThey\u2019re four walls, Javier. That\u2019s it.\u201d But Javier can\u2019t seem to let his old place (or the lifestyle and social status that came with it) go. After he discovers a spare set of keys in his car, he returns to the apartment, steals some cornflakes, goes to the bathroom and sees photos of the family living there now \u2014 businessman Tom\u00e1s (Mario Casas) with his wife, Lara (Bruna Cus\u00ed), and their daughter, M\u00f3nica (Iris Vall\u00e9s).

He\u2019ll do anything \u2014\u00a0anything\u00a0\u2014 to get \u201chis\u201d home back. 2020  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Sci-Fi Social Commentary This is a movie about a very scary buffet. One day, Goreng (Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9) wakes up in a Vertical Self-Management Center, colloquially known as \u201cThe Pit,\u201d which is basically a huge tower with lots and lots of floors. His cellmate, Trimagasi (Zorion Eguileor), explains that food is delivered to the inhabitants of each floor via a platform from the top floor down to the bottom floor, pausing for a fixed period of time on each level so folks can eat. But here\u2019s the rub \u2014 people on the lower levels can only eat what\u2019s left over from those above them. And anyone caught stowing food? They\u2019re killed. Every month, people are randomly assigned a new level. Even if you\u2019re not paying attention to the capitalism critiques or the case for fair distribution of wealth, this tale of survival is gripping enough to keep your interest. We just suggest you\u00a0don\u2019t watch it while eating. 2019  Thriller subgenre:\u00a0Crime Best friends Beth (Leighton Meester) and Kate (Christina Wolfe) are on what starts as a made-for-Instagram girls trip to Croatia, complete with a gorgeous Airbnb, glamorous vacation attire, delicious food and views so breathtakingly idyllic they\u2019ll have you pausing the movie to google flights to Europe. The vacation is a much needed catch-up for the ladies. Beth just had a baby and is in a sort of rough patch with husband Rob (Luke Norris), while Kate\u2019s in the aftermath of a bad breakup herself. But events take a turn when Beth awakens after a drunken night on the town to discover that Kate is missing. And there\u2019s blood on the floor. Yikes. Now Beth has to put together what happened \u2014 miles from home with no one but Zain (Ziad Bakri) the taxi driver to help. Making matters worse? The police have identified their No. 1 suspect in Kate\u2019s disappearance, and it\u2019s Beth. 2022 "

They\u2019re back, ready (or not) for whatever Vecna has in store for them in the beloved series\u2019 final season. Here\u2019s everything we know so far about Stranger Things Season 5: It\u2019s already underway! Code red: As of Jan. 8, 2024, Stranger Things is officially back in production. And as of July 15 \u2014 the eight-year anniversary of Stranger Things Season 1 \u2014 Season 5 is halfway through filming. Take a look at your old Hawkins pals (and some new ones!) filming the series\u2019 final chapter in the video above. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of savoring every single moment,\u201d Sadie Sink (who plays Max) says in the video. Back in his famed hair and makeup chair, Jamie Campbell Bower (who plays Vecna) teases that \u201cSeason 4 was big. Season 5 definitely feels bigger.\u201d Finn Wolfhard shares that he is particularly excited to film scenes \u201cwith the original four\u201d \u2014 Will (Noah Schnapp), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), and Mike (Wolfhard), now that Will returned to Hawkins at the end of Season 4. But \u201clike every season, you never know what to expect,\u201d says McLaughlin. See a photo of the cast back on set below. From left: Noah Schnapp, Millie Bobby Brown, David Harbour, Winona Ryder, Cara Buono, Joe Keery, Amybeth McNulty, Charlie Heaton, Brett Gelman, Maya Hawke, Natalia Dyer, Jamie Campbell Bower, Priah Ferguson, Linda Hamilton, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Ross Duffer, Matt Duffer, Finn Wolfhard, and Sadie Sink of Stranger Things. Plus, check out Ross Duffer\u2019s Instagram for more peeks behind-the-scenes: an image of Matarazzo\u2019s Dustin Henderson is captioned, \u201cHellfire lives!\u201d; another shows Wolfhard\u2019s Mike Wheeler in a room with, unsurprisingly, a Star Wars poster; and another shows Millie Bobby Brown with the Duffers.

At the end of Stranger Things Day 2023, the @strangerwriters Twitter account had one more present for all the fans out there: The first few lines of Season 5, Chapter 1, Scene 1. On Stranger Things Day 2022, we learned the Season 5 premiere episode title: \u201cThe Crawl.\u201d And we hope you\u2019ve been theorizing along with us about what it could mean: What is the Crawl? Who is crawling? Why are they crawling? Where are they crawling to? The\u00a0Stranger Things writers\u00a0started working on Season 5 on Aug. 2, 2022, almost exactly a month after Season 4, Volume 2 debuted. Since then, they have graced the fans with repeated updates on the writing process of Season 5, from beginning their\u00a0grid stage of writing each episode (Aug. 25, 2022) to\u00a0completing that grid (Sept. 20, 2022). Yup! Nell Fisher, Jake Connelly, and Alex Breaux are joining the cast of Stranger Things Season 5. And Linda Hamilton (The Terminator, Children of the Corn, Chuck) announced that she would be joining the final season at 2023\u2019s Tudum: A Global Fan Event. As for any details about her role \u2014 well, that\u2019s as mysterious as the Upside Down. But we do know that she\u2019s a major fan of the series. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be a fangirl and an actress at the same time,\u201d she said during her video announcement at Tudum. \u201cI\u2019m gonna work on that.\u201d Series creators Matt and Ross Duffer\u00a0previously told Tudum that they wrote a 25-page mythology document for Netflix back in Season 1 that delves into the mythology and lore of the Upside Down. \u201cWe were like, \u2018We know what\u2019s going on in the Upside Down, more or less, but we want it to be unknowable. We want it to be mysterious,\u2019 \u201d Matt Duffer explained. \u201cBut they were like, \u2018Yeah, but can you write it down?\u2019 And so we wrote it all down.\u201d While the audience learned quite a bit about the Upside Down in Season 4, there\u2019s definitely more to come in Season 5. \u201cThe last remaining questions that are answered in that document, we\u2019ve punted a couple of those to have some big reveals in Season 5,\u201d said\u00a0Ross Duffer during Geeked Week in June 2022. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really going to affect what Season 5 is about.\u201d To be continued, it seems \u2026 And while you wait for the show\u2019s return, may we suggest a trip to London to check out the Stranger Things: The First Shadow play on the West End? The original stage play production opened on Dec. 14, 2023 at the Phoenix Theatre. Read everything a nerd needs to know about this new dimension of the Stranger Things universe here."

        "body": "You think you know some people. As if it weren\u2019t surprising enough for Mike McKenna (Mark Wahlberg) that his long-lost high school sweetheart, Roxanne (Halle Berry), is now a spy working for an elite government organization, he\u2019s soon also dealing with a series of double-crosses. As The Union reaches its explosive finale, Mike and Roxanne contend with some unpleasant twists and turns \u2014 and the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Construction worker Mike might seem an unlikely recruit for the special forces, but The Union isn\u2019t your average secret agency. \u201cEverybody loves Bond,\u201d Wahlberg tells Tudum. \u201cWe realized that maybe we\u2019re not going to get a chance to be James Bond, so what if we made our own version of a blue-collar James Bond?\u201d That\u2019s The Union: a superspy team of ordinary joes who have more street smarts than book smarts. \u201cThe Union does the dirty work for the CIA and FBI,\u201d Berry told Netflix. \u201cThey\u2019re blue-collar workers, everyday people who get plucked by The Union to be trained to shoot and do combat intelligence and tactical weaponry. They learn all of these specialty skills, but they\u2019re really just average people, and that\u2019s what makes them so different.\u201d The Union\u2019s plot kicks off when one of those everyday people \u2014 Roxanne\u2019s partner, Nick (Mike Colter) \u2014 is killed trying to intercept some important intel. With bad guys on their heels, The Union will need a new team member to help them infiltrate a top-secret auction and recover its files before it\u2019s too late. Enter Mike. \u201cHe's still living at home, still working at the same job, still hanging out at the same bar with the same friends,\u201d Wahlberg says. \u201cHe\u2019s been waiting there in that same spot, hoping that Roxanne is going to walk through that door, and he\u2019ll get one more chance to show her that he\u2019s worthy.\u201d When that chance comes, Mike is dragged off on the adventure of a lifetime, starting with a whirlwind training program. When the time comes to finish the job, though, Roxanne is in for an unpleasant surprise. It turns out Nick is alive \u2014 but not quite the way she remembered him. \u201cNick has not only been a part of The Union, but he\u2019s also been in it for a while,\u201d Colter tells Tudum. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ve kind of outgrown this. I think I can do even bigger and better things, or I think I can do something that\u2019s more for me.\u2019 \u201d Nick has fallen in with Juliet (Jessica De Gouw), the auctioneer who\u2019s selling off Union intel to the highest bidder. He\u2019s in this for the money, The Union be damned. \u201cThat will be hopefully a surprise for the audience,\u201d Berry says, \u201cwhen they find out what a snake he was.\u201d With the team\u2019s headquarters targeted, Mike and Roxanne have to go back to basics to save the day. Fortunately, they get some help from one of Mike\u2019s old Jersey buddies; they\u2019re secreted out of the country on a last-ditch mission to intercept Nick and Juliet, who are on their way to sell The Union\u2019s information to a terror cell. A desperate car chase ensues. In the film\u2019s major action scenes, Mike and Mark shared a similar dilemma \u2014 keeping up. \u201cAnytime I was like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t really need to do this stunt or that stunt,\u2019 she\u2019d just give me that look, and I\u2019d be like, \u2018OK, well I guess I better do it. I\u2019m going to get called out here,\u2019 \u201d Wahlberg says. The final action scene was easier on the actor than his earlier sparring sequences with Berry. \u201cShe hit me with a shot that I felt in a way that I hadn\u2019t felt [before],\u201d Wahlberg says, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ve done many fight scenes, boxing movies, boxed in real life. And I never felt a shot like that.\u201d Of course, that\u2019s not the only impact Roxanne makes on Mike. \u201cWe got to do action, but we also got to do the complexity of a [romantic] relationship, and we got to work out that relationship,\u201d Berry says. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re exes meant that something was amiss in the relationship, and we, in a lightweight way, got to deal with that.\u201d And deal with it they do, dispatching Nick and recovering the intel just in time to stop the sale. All in a day\u2019s work for a few Union reps. Berry and Wahlberg have been friends for more than 30 years, but this is their first film together \u2014 a fact highlighted by the youthful (real-life) photos of the pair that scroll over the closing credits. \u201cYou get with someone that you just like very much, you have chemistry with, that you trust, and then you get to go to fun places because you feel like you can authentically be who you are and they support you in that,\u201d Berry says. \u201cAnd I think we did that for each other.\u201d The Union is now streaming on Netflix."

Like many before them, a group of 30 men and women are leaving their fates in the hands of a dating experiment responsible for bringing soulmates together across the globe. But this time, it\u2019s breaking new ground with an inaugural United Kingdom\u2013based season, co-hosted by Matt and Emma Willis. This August, the married couple will guide the incoming pod squad, which includes a gym-loving funeral director and cellist with a thing for older women, through the inevitable chaos that comes with getting sight unseen. Once they exit the pods, the blossoming relationships will be put to the test, as the fianc\u00e9s jet off to a romantic retreat before bracing for a reality check back home. Within a matter of weeks, only the most committed couples will find themselves at the altar, where they\u2019ll decide if love is truly blind. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. First, it\u2019s time to learn more about the Love Is Blind: UK singles. Below, find out about their absolute deal-breakers, dating dreams, and where to follow them on social media \u2014 and then keep scrolling to learn which couples make it out of the pods.

As the owner of the popular chicken wing franchise Wing Kingz, Aaron is searching for a queen to join his roost. Since ending a long-term relationship, he\u2019s embraced the single life, but now Aaron doesn\u2019t want to be alone when the party ends. After all, he knows everlasting love is possible thanks to his parents, who\u2019ve been together for the past 34 years. Now it\u2019s Aaron\u2019s time to follow in the footsteps of his brothers and sisters and create his own family. It\u2019s safe to say Benaiah is used to riding solo. Following a painful first heartbreak, he\u2019s spent the past 11 years free of any romantic attachments. But now that he\u2019s settled back in the UK after traveling the world, this adventure seeker is ready for his next feat: marriage. However, Benaiah isn\u2019t interested in following any sort of handbook for a happily ever after. Instead, he wants to create a brand new blueprint for what family life could be \u2014 one that is based on love and trust with a partner with whom he can totally let his guard down. Whether you know him as Bobby or by\u00a0his rapper alter-ego Bobby J, music is the way to this British boy\u2019s heart. After traveling the world, he\u2019s now ready to be in perfect harmony with the woman of his dreams. Family comes first for Bobby, who says he doesn\u2019t know where he would be without his mother. And after losing his cousin under tragic circumstances, he\u2019s keenly aware of just how short life is. That\u2019s why Bobby is more than ready to \u201cfall very hard\u201d for his future wife in the pods. When it comes to relationships, Charlie has been through it all \u2014 serial dating, giving his mom control of his apps,\u00a0and\u00a0dodging more than a few catfishes along the way. Despite his cheeky sense of humor, the former soccer player hasn\u2019t had much luck finding lasting love in the past five years. But he hasn\u2019t given up hope just yet. Charlie knows that a genuine connection is waiting for him on the other side of the pods, because \u201clooks can only take things so far.\u201d Plus, he\u2019s of the belief that you ultimately \u201cneed your best mate\u201d for a true partnership, so only a soul connection will do. Long distance was to blame for the demise of Conor\u2019s last relationship, but seven years later he\u2019s more than healed from the heartbreak. Still, this expert flirt has found it difficult to connect with anyone else on a deeper level, despite having plenty of love to give \u2014 and dreams of starting a family one day. But no matter where this journey takes him, Conor is bringing the memory of his late mother with him, as he recently opened a health food business in her memory. In the past, many have been quick to judge fitness enthusiast Freddie solely by his looks. But Freddie has fostered a deep sense of empathy, thanks to his career as a full-time funeral director and his tight bond with brother Jack, who has Down syndrome. As for love, Freddie goes all in, buying flowers, booking travel plans, and making dinner reservations for his partner. Unfortunately, his exes haven\u2019t exactly appreciated his overt displays of affection, so he\u2019s hoping to find someone who speaks his love language. If Jake had his way, he\u2019d already be married with kids by now. Among his friends, he has a reputation for falling in love quickly and being \u201ca bit of a melt\u201d in past relationships. He\u2019s never been more motivated to find his perfect match in the pods. And if any of the women can\u00a0 match his patient and sensitive nature, there\u2019s no stopping Jake from walking away from the experiment with his forever partner. Salsa and language enthusiast Joanes hopes his next partner will be his forever amour. But finding someone who shares his values in this swipe-happy world has proved difficult, as Joanes isn\u2019t interested in playing games or text message tennis. Instead, he\u2019s an old-school romantic who\u2019s searching for something extremely rare in his future wife, as \u201crocks are easily found, but you have to dig deep for that diamond.\u201d Jordan has watched his friends and family get married and have kids one by one, and now he\u2019s ready to take the plunge. And while he\u2019s taken risks in business as the founder of his own company, putting it all on the line for love isn\u2019t his typical approach. For Jordan, trust has to be earned, but he\u2019s ready to throw caution to the wind in the pods should his potential soulmate be on the other side of that glowing blue wall. Going for \u201cInstagram-hot\u201d girls hasn\u2019t yielded the meaningful partnership Ollie has always desired deep down. After six years of being single, he\u2019s finally ready to switch up his dating strategy and deprioritize looks to meet a potential soulmate. Plus, he\u2019s absolutely tired of arriving to all of his friends\u2019 weddings without a date and wants to find his forever plus one. But if anybody wants to be a part of Ollie\u2019s life, they\u2019ll have to get the approval of his family, as absolutely nothing means more to him. Richie is an avid sports fan, but he\u2019s done playing games when it comes to dating. His most serious relationship spanned 18 months, but came to an end when his then-girlfriend expressed doubts about starting a family. Since then, Richie\u2019s been on the hunt for a woman who\u2019s future-oriented and who doesn\u2019t mind giving him plenty of reassurance. But the pods might prove difficult for Richie, whose love language is first and foremost physical touch. Say cello to Ryan: a techno DJ\u00a0and\u00a0cellist, who\u2019s looking to end his two-year single streak.

He\u2019s excited to lead with his personality in the pods, as women in London tend to focus on Sam\u2019s height (for the record, he\u2019s 6\u20194) instead of his heart. But he hasn\u2019t made any real attempts at dating lately, as his \u201cextraordinary\u201d career growth has been on the forefront of his mind, while his love life has fallen by the wayside. Steven is dating to marry and start a family \u2014 and he just needs to find the right woman to return all the love he has to offer. As the owner of his own gym, Steven puts in work when it comes to fitness, but he\u2019s just as focused on a heart and mind connection.

And, as a frequent traveler, he\u2019s done jetting off around the world solo, as \u201cwatching a sunset [isn\u2019t] the same on your own.\u201d But ladies, be warned: Tom is a self-described and very proud \u201cmummy\u2019s boy,\u201d so anyone who makes it down the aisle must first get a green light from the No.1 woman in his life.

        "body": "Drama series come in many different shapes and sizes. Some are grounded in reality; some can transport you to another world entirely. Some build their narratives around intricate crime plots, others are inspired by true stories or focus on sweeping romance. Some even toe the line between drama and comedy. There are countless ways to make a drama series, really \u2014 the only requirement is that it\u2019s an absorbing watch. Whether you ended up here because you know exactly what type of drama you\u2019re looking for or you need a bit of guidance, we\u2019re here to help. Here\u2019s our wide-ranging list of 28 drama series to check out right now. Epic in scale and intimate in scope, Peter Morgan\u2019s dramatization of the life and times of Queen Elizabeth II chronicles her initial rise to the throne and everything that came after. The first and second seasons star Claire Foy as the young queen and cover her marriage to Prince Philip (Matt Smith), while Olivia Colman steps into her majesty\u2019s sensible heels for the third and fourth seasons, which delve into, among other things, the Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson) years and the introduction of Princess Diana (Emma Corrin). Imelda Staunton takes over as Elizabeth for Seasons 5 and 6, as the story explores the highly dissected disintegration of Charles (Dominic West) and Diana\u2019s (now portrayed by Elizabeth Debicki) marriage, the aftermath of Diana\u2019s tragic death, and their sons, William and Harry, coming of age in the public eye. The Crown remains a fascinating watch because of the enduring relevance of its (royal) subjects. 2016  Christina Applegate as a depressed recent widow finding it hard to adjust after the sudden death of her husband. Linda Cardellini as the curiously peppy new friend she meets in a support group. A double-take twist involving an emotionally abusive ex, played by James Marsden. What more could you ask for? The series focuses on the friendship that blossoms between Jen (Applegate) and Judy (Cardellini), and also explores the lingering effects of grief and guilt, as well as what people will sacrifice in order to keep their darkest secrets. If you like your drama with a side of gallows humor, then pitch-black, morbidly funny\u00a0Dead to Me is for you. 2019  How about a good, old-fashioned legal drama? Developed by David E. Kelley (the mind behind shows like\u00a0Ally McBeal and\u00a0Big Little Lies) and based on the novels by Michael Connelly,\u00a0The Lincoln Lawyer centers around idealistic criminal defense lawyer Mickey Haller (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) who re-enters the world of the law and starts running a legal practice out of the back of his car (a Lincoln, of course). Just in case that wasn\u2019t difficult enough, getting back in the game also means working closely with his ex-wives: Maggie (Neve Campbell), a prosecutor, and Lorna (Becki Newton), his aide. Season 1 roped Mickey into a tangled web of conspiracies after the death of a colleague, while Season 2 sees him taking on a highly publicized murder case. 2022  Mohammed Amer may be best known for his role as the foul-mouthed, diner-running cousin of Ramy Youssef\u2019s protagonist on\u00a0Ramy, but\u00a0Mo gives Amer the opportunity to step into the title role. Loosely based on Amer\u2019s real-life history as a Palestinian refugee, the series \u2014 which was developed by Amer and Youssef \u2014 explores the fictional Mo\u2019s experience navigating America\u2019s lengthy asylum process as he struggles to make ends meet in Houston, Texas. With biting humor,\u00a0Mo explores the weight of familial obligation and the very human struggle with grief. It also thoughtfully excavates what it means to find yourself in a country you weren\u2019t born in but nonetheless call home. 2022  If you\u2019re wondering how this Irishman found himself in the Australian outback, so is he. At the start of the series, Elliot (Jamie Dornan) wakes up in a rural Australian hospital after he was forced off the road and left for dead. With no memory of who he is or why he\u2019s so far from home, Elliot has to piece together any clues that might\u00a0help him recover his identity. Luckily, he has help from Helen (Danielle Macdonald), a local cop-in-training who takes a special interest in his case. In\u00a0Season 2, the pair travel back to Ireland as they continue putting the puzzle pieces of his life back together. But they\u2019re soon confronted with the dangerous consequences of his past. Hello, you. Penn Badgley stars as Joe Goldberg, a charismatic bookseller whose charm masks a terrifying history of obsession, stalking, and murder. Using calculated methods like social media tracking and isolation, the very devious Joe has created a pattern of luring unsuspecting women into relationships with him; in his eyes, his victims are simply the objects of his affection, and he turns to violence only after being forced into it. (This series\u00a0really understands how to portray toxic men.) After a series of wild events that we won\u2019t spoil here, Season 4 sends him across the pond to London, sporting a whole new identity and the same old habits \u2014 and will keep you on the edge of your seats until the fifth and final season arrives. 2018  If you\u2019re looking for a crime drama based in recent history, the thrilling and violent\u00a0Narcos dramatizes the story of notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura). Season 1 focuses on his rise to becoming the world\u2019s most prominent cocaine dealer and, eventually, his capture by the DEA and how the agents (played by Boyd Holbrook and Pedro Pascal) in charge of hunting him down got the job done. The series ran for three seasons before spinning off into\u00a0Narcos: Mexico, which stars Diego Luna and Scoot McNairy, and traces the inception of the Mexican drug trade and the Guadalajara cartel in the \u201980s. 2015  \u201cFamily man behaves badly\u201d is one of the most reliable crime drama setups for a reason. Here, the family man is played by Jason Bateman, with Laura Linney starring as his wife. Marty (Bateman) and Wendy Byrde (Linney) are a normal-seeming (albeit unhappily married) couple who just so happen to be knee-deep in the criminal underworld. When we meet them, Marty has been laundering money for a Mexican drug cartel for years \u2014 which Wendy has known about the whole time. Things get more complicated when a job goes wrong and Marty is forced to move Wendy and their children from Chicago to Missouri to save their lives. Twisty and slyly funny,\u00a0Ozark is a story of how people can be corrupted by their own hunger for wealth and power. 2017  Anchored by powerhouse performances from Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, and Kaitlyn Dever,\u00a0Unbelievable\u00a0is based on the true story of the police investigation into a series of rapes in Colorado and Washington from 2008 to 2011. It tells its story across two timelines: one set during the investigation led by the two tenacious detectives (Collette and Wever) who found their way to the truth, and the other during the assault of Marie (Dever), the teenager whose initial accusation kicked off the investigation. The limited series makes for a unique approach to the classic crime formula by devoting significant attention to the victims and the broken complexities of the American judicial system. 2019  No collection of historical dramas would be complete without\u00a0Outlander, which has risen to megahit status over its seven (and counting) seasons. Based on Diana Gabaldon\u2019s series of novels,\u00a0Outlander is a time traveling love story about a World War II nurse (Caitriona Balfe) who gets transported to 1743, where she meets and falls in love with a Scottish warrior (Sam Heughan). Yes, this is a romantic (and, let\u2019s just be honest, very sexy) series with a sci-fi edge, but its timeline also spans centuries and covers a wide range of actual historical events, from the American Revolution to the peace protests of the \u201960s. Romance\u00a0can be educational. 2014  Oppenheimer might have sparked a new wave of Cillian Murphy fever, but\u00a0Peaky Blinders fans have been raving about his talent (and his haircut) for years. Set in 19th century England, the period drama stars Murphy as Tommy Shelby, the cunning yet reserved boss of the Peaky Blinders crime family, who oversees operations as they ascend to the top of the criminal underworld in post-World War I Birmingham. As the gang expands, so does the series, spinning into a tale of international intrigue and adding to its sprawling cast \u2014 which includes Tom Hardy, Josh O\u2019Connor, the late Helen McCrory, and many, many more \u2014 as it goes. With six gritty, stylish seasons, it should keep you busy for a while. 2013  Chess has never looked as exciting as it does in\u00a0The Queen\u2019s Gambit, Scott Frank and Allan Scott\u2019s ornate adaptation of the novel by Walter Tevis. Anya Taylor-Joy stars as Beth Harmon, a chess prodigy whose skill at the game results in her competitive ascension throughout the \u201950s, even as her dependency on prescription drugs and alcohol grows more severe. The series is as much a look at the mind of a tortured genius as it is a reflection on trauma, anxiety, and how failure to address personal demons can get in the way of a person\u2019s dreams. It\u2019s a great showcase for Taylor-Joy, but\u00a0The Queen\u2019s Gambit\u2019s excellent supporting cast also includes memorable turns from Moses Ingram, Marielle Heller, Bill Camp, and Harry Melling. 2020  Dear reader, Shonda Rhimes has made addictive TV dramas her signature, but she took things to a whole new level with this steamy period piece. Rhimes executive produces the lavish adaptation of Julia Quinn\u2019s book series, set in Regency-era London and revolving around the complicated social hierarchies of high society, as young men and women from prominent families attempt to find love. Season 1 follows the story of Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) and her initially fake (but of course, eventually very real) courtship with Simon, Duke of Hastings (Rege\u0301-Jean Page), while Season 2 turns its focus to her eldest brother Anthony\u2019s (Jonathan Bailey) enemies-to-lovers romance with Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley). There\u2019s even more gossip (and instrumental covers of anachronistic pop songs, probably) to come, with Season 3 set to put Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and her longtime crush, Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), in the spotlight. 2020  Alice Oseman\u2019s acclaimed graphic novel comes alive in this British dramedy about Charlie (Joe Locke), a young gay student who falls for Nick (Kit Connor), his rugby-playing classmate.\u00a0Heartstopper uniquely taps into the self-consciousness of first love and the all-consuming brutality of teen emotion through the use of animations \u2014 cartoon beating hearts, falling leaves, and tiny sparks that pop up on screen to literally illustrate characters\u2019 explosive bursts of feeling \u2014 ensuring that its webcomic spirit never gets lost in translation. It\u2019s a show that never looks down at its teen romance, treating it with tender sincerity. That, plus a colorful cast of supporting characters who all have vibrant inner lives of their own, makes for a sweet, swoony, and satisfying watch. 2022  If you\u2019re looking for a story about the ups and downs of falling in love \u2014 the excitement, the longing, and everything in between \u2014 look no further. Dexter Mayhew (Leo Woodall) and Emma Morley (Ambika Mod) meet for the first time on July 15, 1988 \u2014 their last night of university \u2014 before going their separate ways, but\u00a0that one day is only the beginning of their relationship. Based on David Nicholls\u2019 bestselling novel, the limited series follows their decades-spanning love story. Each of One Day\u2019s 14 episodes revisits Dex and Em on the same date over the years as they navigate their life journeys, both together and separately, and experience their own highs, lows, romances, and heartbreaks. With so much history between the pair, will they find their way back to each other? 2024  If you finish\u00a0Bridgerton and are left only with the insatiable need for more\u00a0Bridgerton, we can\u2019t neglect to mention\u00a0Queen Charlotte. Created by Shonda Rhimes, the prequel series gives its titular monarch (played as a young woman by India Amarteifio and as an older woman by Golda Rosheuvel, who reprises her role from\u00a0Bridgerton) a rich backstory of her own, explaining how the fearless Charlotte\u2019s politically convenient marriage to King George III (Corey Mylchreest) came to be. It\u2019s a romantic fantasy that imagines an integrated ton, where the queen is a Black woman whose arrival at court shifts Regency-era England\u2019s perception of race in the Bridgerton universe, but it also delves into the king\u2019s very real health struggles \u2014\u00a0making it a \u201cfiction inspired by fact\u201d saga that\u2019s sweeping and poignant in equal measure. 2023  Co-created by True Blood\u2019s Alexander Woo and\u00a0Game of Thrones masterminds David Benioff and D. B. Weiss,\u00a03 Body Problem\u00a0brings the bestselling series of novels by Cixin Liu to life. Set across multiple timelines and in a number of different countries, the show follows a group of scientists who come together to fend off an impending extraterrestrial threat to humanity. While it\u2019s packed with big ideas about the universe,\u00a03 Body Problem\u2019s greatest asset is how it still manages to narrow its focus on the relationships between the characters. Immerse yourself in Season 1 while we wait for two more. 2024  Based on the manga by Haro Aso, the first season of\u00a0Alice in Borderland introduces us to Arisu (Kento Yamazaki), a video game enthusiast who becomes trapped in an alternate version of Tokyo where he\u2019s forced to play life-or-death games in order to earn extensions on his \u201cvisa.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know how or why he\u2019s there, but he quickly discovers that if he doesn\u2019t play along, he risks being killed by lasers shot from the sky. As he tries to uncover the mystery of the games, he fights to stay alive by teaming up with his fellow players. The series earned a legion of fans thanks to a potent combination of lovable characters and a thrilling story, all set against the backdrop of a chillingly dystopian universe. 2020  It\u2019s never too late to get into Charlie Brooker\u2019s anthology, which specializes in uncovering our darkest fears brought on by our ever-increasing reliance on technology. Episodes stand alone, and many are set in dystopian near-futures where revolutionary tech advancements \u2014 usually created with the intention of making human life easier \u2014 tend to hurt more than they help. The impressive roster of cast members (including Salma Hayek, Daniel Kaluuya, Jon Hamm, Annie Murphy, and more) and genre experimentation help keep the series fresh. If you enjoy feeling unsettled, episodes like \u201cMazey Day\u201d and \u201cPlaytest\u201d experiment with horror; if you prefer something lighter (it\u2019s not all so bleak!), \u201cSan Junipero\u201d and \u201cHang the DJ\u201d are delightfully romantic. 2011  Steve Blackman\u2019s imaginative series, based on the comics by Gerard Way (of My Chemical Romance fame) and Gabriel B\u00e1, follows a group of superpowered, adopted siblings who were raised by their father to form a crime-fighting team. As they aged, the pressure got to be too much, causing a rift. Years later, their father\u2019s death brings them back together, and sparks their curiosity about the mystery of how he died, as well as their own shady origins. And things only get weirder from there! Case in point: time travel plays a big role as the series goes on (it\u2019s due to conclude with an upcoming Season 4), and one character is half-ape and has lived on the moon. 2019  Sometimes you really just need a show with the ideal mix of camp and genuine high-stakes drama.\u00a0Elite, a Spanish-language series set at an exclusive private school, contains a healthy mix of both of those things. The story kicks off with three working-class scholarship students shaking up the high school social order by enrolling at Las Encinas, and tracks the inevitable culture clash between the working-class students and their exorbitantly rich classmates. The commentary on wealth disparity, along with thoughtful musings on race and sexuality, is what makes\u00a0Elite so intelligent, while the murder mystery (yup!) woven throughout the fabric of each season proves that this is a show that, above all, knows how to have fun. 2018  A sun-kissed story of action, adventure, class dynamics, and treasure-hunting (what a combo!),\u00a0Outer Banks follows a scrappy group of teens just trying to get by as they spend their summers working in a North Carolina beachside town. But things heat up after they\u2019re enlisted by their ringleader, John B (Chase Stokes), to help him track down his missing father, which subsequently leads them on a quest to find $400 million worth of gold. From love triangles to the near-constant threat of death,\u00a0Outer Banks has just about everything you could want from teen TV. The young cast includes Madelyn Cline (who appears in\u00a0Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, also on Netflix), Drew Starkey, and Rudy Pankow. 2020  If the\u00a0To All the Boys\u00a0films helped breathe new life into the romantic comedy genre, the spin-off series,\u00a0XO, Kitty, picks up right where that trilogy left off \u2014\u00a0while also adding plenty of drama into the mix.\u00a0XO, Kitty catches us up with Lara Jean Covey\u2019s (Lana Condor) love-obsessed 16-year-old sister, Kitty (Anna Cathcart), who decides to follow her heart by moving to South Korea with the intention of strengthening her connection with long distance boyfriend Dae (Minyeong Choi). She shows up in Seoul and enrolls at his high school, all without telling him \u2014 what could go wrong? Spoiler: a lot! Full of hijinks and soundtracked by a collection of K-pop hits, the whimsical and romantic\u00a0XO, Kitty is a worthy successor to the groundwork Lara Jean and Peter (Noah Centineo) laid over their three films. 2023  Keri Russell as \u200b\u200ban international political operative with a complicated personal life? Say no more. Really, though: Russell plays Kate Wyler, a career diplomat who has recently been reassigned to take over as the new US ambassador to the UK after an attack on a British aircraft carrier creates an international crisis. She\u2019s also having marital problems with her diplomat husband, Hal (Rufus Sewell), with whom her new role creates even bigger issues. As Kate digs deeper into investigating the attack, she begins to discover the lies and deceits lurking just beneath the surface, making it impossible to know who she can actually trust. Catch up now, because the show\u2019s coming back for a second season. 2023  Omar Sy stars in this French heist drama that follows Assane Diop, a charming thief who fancies himself something of a Robin Hood by only stealing from those who deserve it \u2014 in this case, those connected to France\u2019s history of colonization and racism. When the series begins, he\u2019s setting off to steal a necklace that once belonged to Marie Antoinette, which is actually a mask for Diop\u2019s true goal of exacting revenge on the wealthy family responsible for his father\u2019s death. Diop models his professional identity off of novelist Maurice Leblanc\u2019s 20th century gentleman burglar Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, turning him into a master of disguise and subterfuge, and turning\u00a0Lupin into a slick thriller. 2021  Even if you somehow missed the hype surrounding this Emmy-winning juggernaut when it dropped in 2021, it\u2019s never too late catch up \u2014 especially with Season 2 on the way. Anyone familiar with Korean dramas already knows that the best ones will put you through the emotional wringer, but the gory, engaging\u00a0Squid Game raised the stakes even higher. The survival series throws a financially downtrodden group of people into a series of children\u2019s games for a chance to win an enormous cash prize \u2014 which sounds easy enough, until the players realize losing a game results in their deaths. Winning requires a mix of physical and mental fortitude as the characters discover what lengths they\u2019ll go to for the potential of financial security. 2021  This grisly and gripping South Korean series follows a group of students who get trapped in their high school after a zombie virus outbreak begins to spread rapidly among their classmates. The situation grows more dire as the survivors are cut off from communication with the outside world and their food and water supply dwindles, leaving them armed with only their wits as they work together to try to stay alive. (This is the kind of show that gets a lot of mileage out of a well-placed window.) But this\u00a0is still high school, meaning that petty rivalries and love triangles spread as quickly as the virus, which is part of what makes\u00a0All of Us Are Dead so watchable. The first season ends on a bit of a cliff-hanger, but don\u2019t worry: It\u2019ll be back for a\u00a0second. 2022  Mike Flanagan\u2019s name has become synonymous with the horror genre \u2014 he previously entertained and terrified us with\u00a0The Haunting of Hill House,\u00a0The Haunting of Bly Manor, and\u00a0The Midnight Club \u2014 but the ruminative\u00a0Midnight Mass feels like a special gem, even among other great entries in the Flanaverse. Set on a remote island shaken up by the arrival of a magnetic young priest (Hamish Linklater), the supernatural series acts as a study of its characters and an exploration of faith. While there are a number of solid jump scares, the show prefers to establish an eerie slow burn, which only becomes more unsettling the longer it goes on. But don\u2019t let its thoughtful approach and moody imagery fool you:\u00a0Midnight Mass has plenty of bloody tricks up its sleeve. If you need even more, Flanagan\u2019s latest series,\u00a0The Fall of the House of Usher, is also here to keep you up at night. 2021 "

        "body": "We\u2019re all guilty (get it?) of getting sucked into a crime drama. There\u2019s just something so riveting about theorizing as you watch a detective race to uncover the truth, without actually having to get involved in the investigation yourself. If you\u2019re in the mood to dig into a fascinating crime plot, there are many different takes on the genre to choose from. Whether you\u2019re probing around inside the twisted psyche of a killer or holding your breath while a team of professionals executes the perfect heist, we\u2019ve laid out all the clues for what you should watch next. Richard Madden won a Golden Globe for his performance in this British series as war veteran turned bodyguard David Budd, who, after stopping a suicide bomber on a train, is assigned as security detail to Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes). Montague is a conservative politician who\u2019s recently come under fire for backing a controversial bill, and a good amount of the show\u2019s tension comes from her ideological clashes with Budd, who opposes her politics but is nonetheless tasked with protecting her life. Taut and thrilling,\u00a0Bodyguard doesn\u2019t romanticize political intrigue, instead shining a light on the nefarious acts governments get away with every day. 2018  Vince Gilligan\u2019s propulsive drama brought us one of TV\u2019s most notorious antiheroes in Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher who unlocks his capacity for brutality when he starts making and distributing meth. He partners with one of his former students, the lovable burnout Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). Over five seasons, they descend into the dangers and horrors of the drug trade and get entangled with the cartel. Once you finish the series, you can check out its prequel,\u00a0Better Call Saul, which tracks the transformation of scrappy attorney Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) into the flashy criminal lawyer Saul Goodman. If you love stories of moral decline, you can\u2019t get much better than these two. 2008  With only four episodes to tell its story,\u00a0Collateral, created and written by playwright David Hare,\u00a0wastes no time throwing the audience right into the center of a seemingly inexplicable mystery: In London, a delivery worker is shot and killed while delivering a pizza to the ex-wife (played by Billie Piper) of a member of Parliament, in what appears to be a military-style assassination. Assigned to investigate the case is Detective Inspector Kip Glaspie (Carey Mulligan), who quickly begins to realize that the whole murder plot is part of a knotty web that involves disparate factions of the British establishment, from the military to the church.\u00a0Collateral takes the time to flesh out the criminals and the cops. It employs a handful of suspenseful twists and a prescient commentary on Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. 2018  This Emmy-winning series follows Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a forensic analyst specializing in blood spatters who also happens to be a serial killer. But Dexter isn\u2019t your average murderer \u2014 he\u2019s a murderer with a conscience, who justifies his crimes by killing only guilty criminals who have evaded proper punishment by law. The series digs into Dexter\u2019s traumatic backstory to explain why he is the way he is, and spends plenty of time getting inside his mind. But the best thing about\u00a0Dexter is that it\u2019s not\u00a0just a crime show; at any given point, it can also become a horror story, a family drama, a dark comedy, or a psychological thriller. 2006  Produced by Shonda Rhimes, this legal thriller stars Viola Davis as Annalise Keating, a law professor who, alongside five of her students, becomes involved in a murder. And that\u2019s just in Season 1! Throughout six seasons, the characters engage in corruption, betrayal, and more than their fair share of killings. Amid all of that, they continue going to class, participating in court cases, and becoming entangled in each other\u2019s love lives. With each season teasing out a mystery via flash-forwards,\u00a0How to Get Away with Murder makes for an unpredictably twisty watch. 2014  Sofia Vergara transforms in the titular role of this Emmy-nominated limited series inspired by the life of crime boss Griselda Blanco. Beginning in the late \u201970s and spanning into the early \u201980s,\u00a0Griselda\u00a0maps Blanco\u2019s journey from fleeing Medell\u00edn to keep her children safe into becoming the ruthless queenpin who was known as Godmother of Cocaine. What makes\u00a0Griselda so interesting is how unglamorous it makes its central figure\u2019s rise seem, showing how easily people can be warped by greed and the temptation of power. The drama is anchored by Vergara\u2019s committed performance, but scene-stealing turns from Mart\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez as Blanco\u2019s hit man and Alberto Guerra as her husband help bring the world to life. 2024  Films like\u00a0Se7en\u00a0and\u00a0Zodiac made David Fincher synonymous with the crime genre (see also: The Killer), and\u00a0Mindhunter \u2014 which he executive produced and directed several episodes of \u2014 has his signature style over it. Set during the early days of criminal profiling in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, the series spotlights the inception of the FBI\u2019s Behavioral Science Unit. Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany star as a duo of FBI agents who explore the minds and motives of serial killers by interviewing them, and Anna Torv plays the psychology professor who joins their team. The drama draws parallels between the interviewers and their subjects, which makes for chilling, compelling television. 2017  If you\u2019re searching for a crime series that\u2019s a bit less grim than some of the genre\u2019s other offerings, give the deliciously fast-paced international sensation\u00a0Money Heist a try. The series follows two different bank robberies, which have been put together by an enigmatic figure known only as \u201cProfessor,\u201d who recruits a highly skilled group of people to carry out a pair of intricate heists. A snappy blend of action and emotional drama (plus the built-in Halloween costume factor courtesy of those red jumpsuits) turned\u00a0Money Heist into a fan favorite. Spin-offs include Money Heist: Korea and the upcoming\u00a0Berlin, which focuses on Pedro Alonso\u2019s titular jewel thief. 2017  One of the most famous drug kingpins in modern history, Pablo Escobar (played here by Wagner Moura), gets his story told in the gritty and violent\u00a0Narcos. While the first season tracks Escobar\u2019s journey as he becomes the world\u2019s most prolific cocaine distributor, it also focuses on the urgent search for him, spearheaded by two DEA agents (played by Pedro Pascal and Boyd Holbrook) \u2014 it\u2019s an engrossing cat-and-mouse thriller. Similarly, its spin-off series\u00a0Narcos: Mexico, led by Diego Luna as the ruthless Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo, explores the creation of the Mexican drug trade and the Guadalajara Cartel, as well as the DEA\u2019s pursuit of Gallardo. 2015  Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams\u2019 drama centers around Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman), a financial adviser who, when we meet him at the beginning of the series, has already been knee-deep in a money-laundering scheme with a drug cartel for years. After a job goes sideways and his partner is killed, Marty moves his wife (Laura Linney) and kids to Missouri\u2019s Lake of the Ozarks region to, sure, save their lives \u2014 but mostly to launch an even bigger operation. Once there, the Byrdes become involved with the local crime scene, which includes other families and, later, the mafia. A tense thriller,\u00a0Ozark is about the insatiable hunger for money and power \u2014 and the dark things people will do to maintain their status. 2017  Cillian Murphy stars as Thomas Shelby, the steely and ambitious boss of a crime family in 19th-century Birmingham\u2019s criminal underworld. Across six seasons, the series traces his rise, even as new foes threaten to disrupt the family\u2019s ascension from street gangsters to legitimate political players. With an anachronistic rock \u2019n\u2019 roll soundtrack, glamorous costumes, and a host of layered performances from Murphy and the ever-expanding supporting cast \u2014 which includes Anya Taylor-Joy, Tom Hardy, and the late Helen McCrory, among many others \u2014 this slick period piece (which now has a movie on the way) is worthy of its passionate fan base. 2013  Each season of\u00a0The Sinner finds Detective Harry Ambrose (Bill Pullman) investigating the unlikely culprits of various crimes. Season 1 finds him trying to uncover the truth of why Cora Tannetti (Jessica Biel), a mild-mannered mother, stabbed a man to death in an apparently random act of violence, while Season 2 sends him back to his upstate New York hometown to look into the case of a young boy who claims to have poisoned his parents. Ambrose\u2019s own deep-seated trauma helps him relate to the people he\u2019s investigating, which subsequently helps him deduce their true motives, making for a mystery that\u2019s less of a\u00a0whodunit and more of a\u00a0whydunit. 2017  This British series, which just wrapped its final season, counts none other than Drake among its fans \u2014\u00a0and its executive producers. The kinetic and violent\u00a0Top Boy focuses on a pair of friends (played by Ashley Walters and Kane Robinson) who make their money dealing drugs in London. They live in the Summerhouse Estate, which has been devastated by crime and is ignored by the corrupt police force, and navigate their way to the top of the hierarchy \u2014 until it becomes painfully clear that only one of them can rule over this cruel world. Between the series and its predecessor,\u00a0Top Boy Summerhouse, the supporting cast includes a who\u2019s who of British and Irish actors \u2014 Barry Keoghan, Letitia Wright, and Benedict Wong. Both shows cleverly drill home the point that sitting on a bloody throne has incredible consequences. 2019  Based on Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning reporting by T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong,\u00a0Unbelievable follows the police investigation into a series of rapes in Colorado and Washington between 2008 and 2011. The series uniquely explores the survivors\u2019 perspectives and the injustices they continue to experience in the aftermath at the hands of the American judicial system. Led by \u00a0outstanding performances from Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as the two detectives who set out to uncover the truth and Kaitlyn Dever as the teenage girl whose initial report was picked apart and dismissed by the cops,\u00a0Unbelievable\u00a0is a brutally gripping series. 2019  Your Honor, which ran for two seasons from \u201920\u2013\u201923, was Bryan Cranston\u2019s first starring role after\u00a0Breaking Bad, playing another family man who gets in over his head when he turns to a life of crime. But unlike Walter White,\u00a0Your Honor\u2019s Michael Desiato takes no pleasure in his descent into dealings with drug cartels and mob bosses. When the series begins, Michael is a New Orleans judge whose teenage son accidentally kills another boy \u2014 who just happens to be connected to the mafia \u2014 in a hit-and-run. Desperate to protect his son, Michael helps him cover up his involvement, which has dangerous consequences for their entire family. In addition to Cranston,\u00a0Your Honor\u2019s stacked cast includes Michael Stuhlbarg, Carmen Ejogo, Margo Martindale, Isiah Whitlock Jr., and Maura Tierney."

Whether you\u2019re looking for a thriller, comedy, or even a little sci-fi with your murder mystery, it\u2019s fun to follow along and see if you can guess the killer before the main character does. Do you want something so tense you cover your eyes, or funny enough to bring tears to them? Whatever kind of thrill you need, we\u2019re on the case. When a dead body shows up on\u00a0Longharvest Lane in London, it kicks off an investigation. But that body is not just there in one place or time \u2014 and this is more than just a crime story. The same body is in that same sport in 1890, 1941, 2023, and 2053.\u00a0Bodies is a time-traveling saga that follows four detectives in four different time periods and their four different investigations. The stories of their lives spiral out from there, and start to reveal the why behind the crimp in time that has them all investigating the same body and same mystery. 2023  Nothing is quite what it seems in the tiny English town of Little Kilton, where popular high school student Andie Bell (India Lillie Davies) went missing five years ago. Most residents have accepted the police narrative that Andie\u2019s boyfriend, Sal Singh (Rahul Pattni), killed her before dying by suicide, but Pip Fitz-Amobi (Emma Myers) isn\u2019t so sure of this version of events. The smart and single-minded Pip is certain of Sal\u2019s innocence, and with help from his brother, Ravi (Zain Iqbal),\u00a0she\u2019s determined to prove it. The six-episode season is based on Holly Jackson\u2019s wildly popular YA novel\u00a0of the same name \u2014 come for the murder mystery, stay for the deeper themes about friendships, family, and growing up. 2024  When a group of teenagers at an elite British school form a secret society with the sole purpose of exposing their bullies, they don\u2019t expect one of those bullies to turn up dead \u2014 or that they\u2019d be framed for the murder. This UK thriller series has shades of\u00a0Mean Girls, but with a much darker vibe. What else would you expect when there\u2019s a murder instead of a burned book involved? 2020  Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is back! In this second iteration of Rian Johnson\u2019s\u00a0Knives Out franchise,\u00a0Blanc and his over-the-top accent head to Greece, where they wind up in the company of a tech billionaire and the group of friends he\u2019s gathered for a murder mystery party on his private island. But when one of the guests winds up\u00a0actually\u00a0dead, there\u2019s only one smartly dressed man who can unravel what happened. Full of movie stars (the cast includes Kate Hudson, Dave Bautista, Jessica Henwick, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Madelyn Cline, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, and Edward Norton), glamour and a few surprise cameos, it\u2019s the perfect puzzle-box movie experience. Be sure to keep your knives sharp as the next film in the Benoit Blanc series, Wake Up Dead Man, sleuths our way in 2025. 2022  Serial killers are not uncommon in murder mysteries, but what about one who\u00a0slides through time, without aging? In this sci-fi thriller, Thomas Lockhart (Boyd Holbrook) starts out as a police officer investigating a series of bizarre deaths, and then chases after the perpetrator over decades. He\u2019s becoming obsessed with figuring out both who\u2019s behind the murders and how they\u2019re carrying them out \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t? 2019  How are the stories of an American criminalist on death row (Stanley Tucci) and a vicar in a quiet English town (David Tennant) related? That\u2019s one of the mysteries in this four-part series from\u00a0Sherlock creator Steven Moffatt. The plots are linked by British journalist Beth Davenport (Lydia West), who comes to an American prison to get help on a story she\u2019s writing. But how? Does this seem like a normal setup? No. But nothing Moffatt creates is truly as it seems, which is the fun of watching his work. 2022  When a fellow defense attorney is murdered, Mickey Haller (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) inherits his practice \u2014 and some of his headache cases, including that of a video game developer (Christopher Gorham) accused of murdering his wife. While trying to untangle the mystery, and also make a comeback himself after an accident and drug rehab, he realizes that he could suffer the same fate as his former (and now very dead) colleague. Why is Haller called the Lincoln Lawyer? Not only is that name the title of the successful Michael Connelly novel on which this series is based, but Haller\u2019s office also happens to be located\u00a0in the back of a Lincoln Town Car, which leads to some wild car chase scenes around Los Angeles. 2022  When Mari Gilbert\u2019s (Amy Ryan) daughter goes missing on Long Island, she expects the police to help. When they don\u2019t, she starts a search on her own, which eventually dovetails with the unsolved murders of multiple sex workers. The movie, directed by documentarian Liz Garbus in her narrative debut, is based on a true story \u2014 Gilbert became an activist \u2014 first\u00a0told in the book\u00a0Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery by Robert Kolker. (Garbus is also directing a documentary about the real-life case.) It\u2019s a sad story, but an important one that shines a light on whose murders get attention and justice, and who is too often left in the dark. 2020  A cop (Adam Sandler) and a hairdresser (Jennifer Aniston) take a long-awaited trip to Europe. What could go wrong? Everything, of course. When the couple take up a billionaire (Luke Evans) on his offer to join his yacht party, it seems like a dream, and much more luxurious than their planned bus tour. Of course, someone winds up murdered. But who did it? If you like the first film, follow it up with\u00a0Murder Mystery 2, which finds Nick and Audrey as full-time private detectives \u2014 not very successful ones, it turns out. They accept an invitation to the wedding of\u00a0Vikram \u201cThe Maharajah\u201d Govindan\u00a0(Adeel Akhtar) and of course there\u2019s a murder. Can they solve it? And save their business? Watch to find out. 2019  This spoof series\u00a0stars Will Arnett as detective Terry Seattle, who solves crimes despite having a series of seemingly clueless, bumbling partners in this improvisational comedy. Those partners, played by a cast of all-star improv actors including Conan O\u2019Brien, Marshawn Lynch, Kumail Nanjiani, Annie Murphy, Sharon Stone, and Ken Jeong, don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and need to fill in the blanks \u2014 and their lines \u2014 on the spot. The plot never goes quite where you expect, which is exactly the point. (A 2022 Christmas special also promises a holiday-themed dose of twists and laughs.) 2022  When a realtor is murdered in a Maine home she and her boyfriend had been showing for sale, the question of course is: Who did it? The answer isn\u2019t so simple, as two police detectives (Benicio Del Toro and Ato Essandoh) find out when they start to investigate. They find themselves in a twisted web of sex, money, and betrayal, and uncover more layers of guilt and grime until the true killer is revealed. This all-star cast also includes Justin Timberlake, Alicia Silverstone, and Eric Bogosian, who help turn this crime flick into a tense, twisty thriller. 2023  In this psychological thriller directed by Joe Wright and co-starring Anthony Mackie, Gary Oldman, Brian Tyree Henry, and Julianne Moore, Amy Adams plays Anna Fox, a child psychologist whose agoraphobia means she knows pretty much everything that\u2019s going on with her neighbors, as observed from her brownstone window. That includes witnessing her neighbor Jane (Jennifer Jason Leigh) get stabbed to death, but the police don\u2019t believe her and claim Jane\u2019s alive. Did Fox\u2019s drinking and drug use trick her into making up a gruesome murder? Or did she see what she thought she saw? 2021  Does this title remind you of something? Maybe a few things? That\u2019s because this dark comedy is a parody of psychological thrillers, especially the trope of a woman who sees something unsettling and then becomes a possible target.\u00a0Kristen Bell stars as Anna, a woman who thinks she sees a murder \u2014 or does she? Don\u2019t let the parody premise fool you, though. There\u2019s a real mystery here, even as the series pokes fun at the genre in a very loving way. 2022 "

        "body": "This is a safe space to admit that sometimes you\u2019re just not in the mood to watch a serious drama. They\u2019re great, of course, but we\u2019ve all gotten that itch to escape reality and enter a world where wild stunts, big muscles, and bigger explosions are the norm. Action is a wide-ranging genre, covering everything from thrilling heist flicks,\u00a0swaggering Westerns, and films about people trying to save the world from shady government operations. That\u2019s what makes them so classic: No matter what you\u2019re looking for, there\u2019s probably an action movie out there that fits the bill. Whether you\u2019re an adrenaline junkie looking for some excitement or the kind of person who enjoys living vicariously through fearless fictional characters, check out these 17 action movies that are sure to get your pulse racing. The fourth installment in the\u00a0Beverly Hills Cop film series comes a whole 30 years after the third film and 40 years after the original film that started it all. Eddie Murphy reprises his role as Detroit detective Axel Foley, who returns once more to Beverly Hills after he uncovers a conspiracy that puts both his estranged daughter (played by Taylour Paige) and his old friend Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold, reprising his role from the original films) in danger. That all sounds serious, but\u00a0Axel F is just as freewheeling as its predecessors \u2014 its titular character gets into his usual antics, from car chases to false identities. With a mix of familiar characters like\u200b\u200b John Ashton\u2019s John Taggart and Paul Reiser\u2019s Jeffrey Friedman, as well as new characters played by Paige, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Kevin Bacon,\u00a0Axel F is an ideal sequel. It pays tribute to the old while making room for the new. 2024  Back in 2020,\u00a0Da 5 Bloods earned itself the rare honor of being a modern action movie that also got the prestige awards drama treatment. A vivid and often very moving film brought to life by director Spike Lee,\u00a0Da 5 Bloods follows a group of four veterans (played by Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, and Isiah Whitlock Jr.) who return to Vietnam to search for the remains of their fallen squad leader (played in flashbacks by Chadwick Boseman), as well as the hidden treasure they helped him bury during the war. This is an adventure tale that deftly blends history lessons with present-day conversations, all set to Terence Blanchard\u2019s Academy Award\u2013nominated score. It also marks the last of Boseman\u2019s films to be released during his lifetime, and his commanding performance will remind you of what an unparalleled star he was. 2020  Damsel gives new meaning to the term fairy-tale wedding. This fantasy-action film stars Millie Bobby Brown as Elodie, a young woman who agrees to marry a prince from a mysterious royal family at the urging of her father \u2014 he assures her that the marriage will help the people in their impoverished community. It\u2019s only after the wedding, when Elodie participates in a strange ceremony with her new husband and his family, that she discovers she\u2019s been roped into something bigger than she could\u2019ve imagined. (Though, to be fair, she\u00a0did ignore a warning from her stepmother, played by Angela Bassett, who urged her not to go through with the marriage.) Elodie is thrown into a cavern as a sacrifice to a dragon as part of a centuries-old arrangement, and she quickly learns she\u2019s just the latest in a long line of brides to meet such a fate. From there, Elodie shifts into survival mode, clawing her way out by any means necessary. 2024  Chris Hemsworth goes full surrogate dad mode in this film about Tyler Rake, a mercenary who becomes involved with a mission to retrieve the kidnapped son of a drug lord. After Rake is betrayed and the mission grows more dangerous, he commits to stopping at nothing to get the boy home. Directed by Sam Hargrave (in his first feature film) and adapted by Joe Russo from Ande Parks\u2019 graphic novel Ciudad,\u00a0Extraction is the kind of rousing thriller that\u2019ll keep you hooked all the way through. Once you finish, you can jump right to its 2023 sequel, which adds Idris Elba to the mix as a mysterious stranger who recruits Tyler for a dangerous mission to rescue the family of a notorious gangster. Both films are known for their enormous and ambitious\u00a0one-shot action sequences, which must be seen to be believed. 2020  Gal Gadot leads Tom Harper\u2019s espionage thriller as Rachel Stone, an MI6 operative working undercover as double agent for the Charter, a shadowy network of peacekeeping spies. Stone is tasked with guarding \u201cthe Heart,\u201d a powerful artificial intelligence system, lest it fall into the wrong hands. When an ambush results in Stone\u2019s cover being blown, the Charter is compromised and the Heart is put in danger, putting Stone up against Keya (Alia Bhatt), a hacker with mysterious motives. Complete with car chases, twists, and plenty of globe-trotting,\u00a0Heart of Stone is perfect for anyone who likes their action with a side of spy intrigue. 2023  The 2024 Academy Award winner for Best Visual Effects portrays the notoriously destructive kaiju going back to his roots in Japan. Set in the somber aftermath of World War II, the film centers around Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who holds great shame over his actions during the war. He also has survivor\u2019s guilt when he returns home to find that his loved ones have been killed. As Godzilla starts wreaking havoc on the country, Koichi becomes the film\u2019s reluctant hero, dedicating himself to stopping the enormous creature in order to redeem himself. It\u2019s no wonder\u00a0Godzilla Minus One, as thrillingly epic as it is deeply moving, earned so many accolades. (You can also watch it in black-and-white as\u00a0Godzilla Minus One/Minus Color.) 2023  Before he embraced the Kenergy in\u00a0Barbie, Ryan Gosling returned from his four-year acting hiatus with\u00a0The Gray Man, Joe and Anthony Russo\u2019s adaptation of Mark Greaney\u2019s novel of the same name. Here, he\u2019s in top form playing the enigmatic CIA hit man known only by his alias, Sierra Six, who becomes the target of a mustachioed, sociopathic assassin (Chris Evans, clearly having the time of his life getting to play the villain) after Six learns of long-hidden corruption within the agency. This feels like an old-school, globe-trotting action-thriller, with its A-list ensemble (Ana de Armas, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, Alfre Woodard, Billy Bob Thornton, and a scene-stealing Julia Butters co-star alongside Gosling and Evans), flashy stunts, and talented directors coming together to make one big joy ride of a film. More good news:\u00a0There\u2019s a sequel on the way. 2022  This energetic, neon-tinged action-thriller is a bit like a female-led spin on\u00a0John Wick, starring Karen Gillan as a hit woman who teams up with a formidable group of female assassins (that includes her estranged mother, played by Lena Headey) in order to save a young girl (Chloe Coleman) from a menacing crime ring, which is headed by a mysterious figure played by Paul Giamatti. It\u2019s a gleefully violent firecracker of a film that unfolds at a breakneck pace, all while balancing itself out by adding in a healthy layer of complicated family dynamics to its story. But if that premise and the killer title aren\u2019t enough to hook you, you should also know that there\u2019s nothing more enjoyable than putting Gillan, Headey, Carla Gugino, Michelle Yeoh, and Angela Bassett in a movie together and watching them pal around. Maybe a Western is more your speed, which should bump Jeymes Samuel\u2019s sleek, gun-slinging revenge story right up to the top of your list. Blending reality and fiction and imagining several figures from the Old West like Bass Reeves and Stagecoach Mary, this flick is about Nat Love\u2019s (Jonathan Majors) quest to take down an enemy from his past.\u00a0The Harder They Fall is notable for being a Western with an entirely Black principal cast \u2014 an unstoppable ensemble that boasts performances from Regina King, Idris Elba, LaKeith Stanfield, and Zazie Beetz, among others. Whether you\u2019re well-versed in cowboy movie lore or completely new to the genre, Samuel crafted a stylish film with a killer soundtrack (executive produced by Jay-Z with contributions from Kid Cudi and Seal) that\u2019s well worth anyone\u2019s time. 2021  Director F. Gary Gray is no stranger to a heist flick, having directed the 2003 remake of\u00a0The Italian Job. He returns to the genre with\u00a0Lift, which stars Kevin Hart as the leader of a band of art thieves. At the beginning of the film, they\u2019ve recently pulled off the seemingly impossible task of boosting an NFT.\u00a0Their scheme is quickly found out, but instead of arresting them, an Interpol agent (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw) offers the team an opportunity to help catch Lars Jorgensen (Jean Reno), a billionaire working with a group of hackers, in exchange for their freedom. The catch? They have to pull it all off on a plane. There\u2019s an immediacy to the action sequences as the crew tries to pull off the mission during such a limited window, and it\u2019s bolstered by a great supporting cast that includes Vincent D\u2019Onofrio and Billy Magnussen. 2024  Gina Prince-Bythewood directs this adaptation of Greg Rucka\u2019s (who also writes the screenplay) comic book, and the film arrived with a bang when it was released in 2020. Revolving around a team of five immortal, super-skilled, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 covert mercenaries who\u2019ve been protecting the world for centuries, the film finds them facing their greatest challenge yet when a powerful group threatens to capture and exploit them.\u00a0The Old Guard is gripping and gritty, with expertly crafted action sequences padded with thoughtfully explored themes around the nature of humanity. It even has a surprisingly moving love story, if that\u2019s your thing. Charlize Theron leads a marvelous cast that also includes KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Marwan Kenzari. Watch, and maybe even rewatch, before the\u00a0upcoming sequel. 2020  We\u2019ve included quite a few solid historical options on this list, but\u00a0Outlaw King still stands out from the rest of the pack. David Mackenzie\u2019s period piece takes place in 14th-century Scotland, following the reign of Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine) as he took control of the Scottish crown, rebelled against King Edward I (Stephen Dillane) and led an uprising against the English army to win back his country\u2019s independence. The film has all the richness of a well-crafted historical epic that doesn\u2019t hold back on the bloody, medieval fight scenes. Pine is excellent, and as an added bonus, Florence Pugh and Aaron Taylor-Johnson co-star. 2018  Bromance has never been so exciting. An incredibly creative idea meets maximalist action sequences in S.S. Rajamouli\u2019s sprawling Telugu-language work of historical fiction that smashed box office records in India and around the world. The film follows two real-life Indian revolutionaries, the ambitious police officer Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) and the warrior Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan), as they form a close friendship and later team up to fight back against the British Raj. Don\u2019t be intimidated by\u00a0RRR\u2019s three-hour run time \u2014 once the credits roll, you\u2019ll find yourself wishing that this thoroughly entertaining spectacle\u00a0would go on for just a bit longer. 2022  Where would we be without the action-comedy? Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, this fun film mixes elements of the classic screwball genre with big-budget action. It also features a trio of massive movie stars \u2014 Dwayne Johnson (who reunites with Thurber after\u00a0Central Intelligence and\u00a0Skyscraper), Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot \u2014 and lets them crack wise as often as they outrun gunfire. The narrative highlights the unlikely partnership between FBI agent John Hartley (Johnson) and Nolan Booth (Reynolds), the well-practiced art thief Hartley enlists to help him track down Sarah \u201cThe Bishop\u201d Black (Gadot), a slippery crook who delights in making her victims squirm. 2021  From\u00a0Sin City to\u00a0Machete to\u00a0Fantastic Four, Jessica Alba knows her way around an action movie. In\u00a0Trigger Warning, she makes her return to the genre as Parker, a skilled Special Forces commando who\u2019s called back to her hometown after the sudden death of her father. She reunites with the people she used to know, including her ex-boyfriend and his complicated family, but it\u2019s not much of a happy homecoming \u2014 she begins to realize that her dad\u2019s death might just be connected to a criminal conspiracy. What ensues is a fast-paced revenge tale, as Parker seeks to take down the people who killed her father. 2024  With\u00a0Margin Call\u2019s J.C. Chandor in the director\u2019s chair and\u00a0The Hurt Locker\u2019s Mark Boal behind the script, it\u2019s no surprise that\u00a0Triple Frontier packs the punch that it does. The film falls somewhere between the action and heist genres, following a small crew of former Special Forces operatives that reunite to stage a robbery of a powerful crime lord in South America. What should be a relatively straightforward job is complicated by an unforeseen turn that has the men questioning themselves and each other. Cleverly plotted and well acted (its stacked cast is filled out by Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Pedro Pascal, Charlie Hunnam, and Garrett Hedlund), you shouldn\u2019t sleep on this one for a moment longer. 2019  Wingwomen is the rarest type of action movie: one that focuses on female friendship. M\u00e9lanie Laurent directs and stars in this French caper about a professional thief who\u2019s hoping to retire after getting worn down by an entire life on the run. A feisty and funny spin on the classic \u201cone last job\u201d trope,\u00a0Wingwomen\u00a0finds Laurent\u2019s Carole teaming up with her best friend and fellow thief, Alex (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), and their new recruit, stunt driver Sam (Manon Bresch). They embark on a complicated international heist to steal a famous painting. The car chases and shoot-outs are exciting, but Wingwomen\u2019s most unique quality is how much time it allows us to spend getting to know the trio at its center. 2023 "

        "body": "The Umbrella Academy may have started off with each of the Brellies dancing on their own to Tiffany\u2019s \u201cI Think We\u2019re Alone Now.\u201d But the fractured siblings ended the series together, doing what they do best: unintentionally causing the end of the world, but stopping it just before it does. \u201cI wanted to show that families, even with time apart, can always come back together,\u201d explained series creator, showrunner, and executive producer Steve Blackman. \u201cThey\u2019re the Hargreeves family. They love each other.\u201d As Season 3 ended with Allison (Emmy Raver-Lampman) teaming up with Sir Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) to reset the timeline, the siblings began Season 4 as powerless adults, truly on their own. \u201cThis is the first time in their lives that they really had to grow up and it\u2019s definitely changed them,\u201d said Blackman. But as Ben (Justin H. Min) and Jennifer (Victoria Sawal) find each other and put The Cleanse into motion, the siblings learn that in order to save the world in this timeline, they have to cease to exist \u2014 entirely. In other words, when Ben and Jennifer come together to form The Cleanse monster (because their bodies are made of Ben\u2019s Marigold and Jennifer\u2019s Durango that cancel each other out), the siblings realize that all the Hargreeves Marigold has to be eliminated to set the world right again. All of them \u2014 Viktor (Elliot Page), Luther (Tom Hopper), Diego (David Casta\u00f1eda), Allison, Klaus (Robert Sheehan), Five (Aidan Gallagher), and Lila (Ritu Arya) \u2014 agree to let The Cleanse consume them in the home where the Hargreeves family grew up, sacrificing themselves for the greater good and for the one true timeline to be restored. [*Editor\u2019s note: To see all of the cameos in that final park scene, check out our Easter eggs list here). But no one will ever know \u2026 except those of us watching. What does it mean to be a superhero then, if no one knows what they gave up to save the world? Blackman, the cast, and Gerard Way, creator of the Dark Horse comic series, sat down with Tudum to consider if there were ever a timeline where Ben and Jennifer could\u2019ve lived happily ever after without The Cleanse, explain what happened on the Reginald and Abigail\u2019s home planet, and shed light on whether the Brellies died or \u2026 something else. When did you know the ending for the Brellies, and did you always know they\u2019d have to cease to exist in order to restore the timeline? Steve Blackman: I knew from the very beginning \u2013\u2013 when I first got the show \u2013\u2013 that I had an idea of how the ending would be. I wanted to explore the notion of, \u201cAre you really a superhero if no one ever knows that you exist? What is the definition of superheroes? Are you truly a superhero if no one ever knows that you\u2019re the ones who saved them?\u201d And I like the idea of: What would they be remembered as? What would it feel to them, to never be remembered? What would it mean to the world? So I wanted an ending where I didn\u2019t want them to \u201cdie\u201d because they don\u2019t technically die. But they will cease to exist in a way that no one will ever know that they ever were in any timeline, in any place. So there\u2019ll be no memory of these people. The only memory exists in the family that survived, but the world will never know all the sacrifices that the Umbrella Academy made for them over many, many years, many, many timelines. That they were the anomaly in the universe that had to be taken away, that they were the thing that Hargreeves released and started, and they were the reason the world was not the right way it should be \u2026 I wanted to subvert the expectation [that] the hero has to win in the end, or the hero has to lose in the end. I thought this was a slightly different way to go. I hope the fans like it. Can you paint a picture of what it was like on set, filming the last scene with the Brellies when The Cleanse takes them? I heard it was 3:30 in the morning. Blackman: There were two things going on that night. One, everyone was truly exhausted. They had stood in that circle for 13 hours with an incredible amount of coverage. They were getting very, very tired. It didn\u2019t hit them that this was the last time they\u2019d be together until very late in the night, towards the end. And we were going to do the final shot \u2014 the window shot, as we call it. I said, \u201cGuys, I just want to let you know before we do that, this is the last time you\u2019ll ever be together as actors in this scene. We still have to shoot a bit more, but none of you\u2019ll be together again.\u201d And there was a moment where I could see their faces, where they go, \u201cOh shit, this is it.\u201d Then, all that tiredness went away, and there was just one final look between them. They did a really wonderful final take, and you could see in the looks that it wasn\u2019t just them playing their roles at that point. The actors themselves felt the sense of, \u201cOh wow, this is really the last time we\u2019ll be together.\u201d And just after we finished them, we blew up the set because that was part of it. So it was a very emotional night. How did you all support each other after that last scene was cut? Blackman: We hugged it out, and there was such a level of exhaustion. Everyone went home. As we started finishing off individual shots of each of them, that was more emotional. The next day, Allison had her final scene, just with her and a few other people. Then I clapped her out as an individual, and we said, \u201cThis is your final scene.\u201d And once that hit, they all had tears in their eyes and they realized, \u201cOh wow, this is the end.\u201d So I think it was more emotional when they ended individually, but I think that night was just so overwhelming for so many reasons. How did the cast react when they read the finale script for the first time? Blackman: We actually didn\u2019t table-read that script. We were so behind. I got a lot of great messages from them, but I held the ending off. I do this every year. I don\u2019t want to give them too much notice about the ending. So they didn\u2019t get the end-end moment until the day before. I wanted the emotion to feel a bit more raw in the moment. I didn\u2019t want them to overthink it, and I think they appreciated it. You can see on the shots that the emotion\u2019s pretty raw and real. The tears. What do you admire most about your character and their journey till the end? Emmy Raver-Lampman: She\u2019s so tenacious, so fiercely loyal, and even though it doesn\u2019t seem like it, Allison has incredible maternal instincts. At the end of the day, she loves this ridiculous family so much. They all do, and they all show it in different ways, but Allison has so much power, and I love that time and time again she continued to find and understand her own voice more and more as the show went on. And I just think that\u2019s really beautiful, especially as a Black woman portraying a Black woman on TV. David Casta\u00f1eda: He somehow always stumbles upon the learning lesson, even if he doesn\u2019t know what it is. And at the end of Season 4, you see him appreciate family, and his powers only come secondary to the people around him. Tom Hopper: [Luther\u2019s] a big golden retriever or Labrador, really. I just admire his loyalty. He is always the one who\u2019s trying to keep the family together and get the family back together. And for whatever reason, whether it\u2019s saving the world or just the family reunion. Ritu Arya: I feel like everyone needs the experience of playing a superhero in their life. Even if it\u2019s not on TV, do it in the mirror. Do your mirror work, you\u2019ll feel great. In the post-credits scene, we see eight marigold flowers spring up. We can assume it\u2019s the Brellies, right? Blackman: Not necessarily. You can assume many things from that. We can assume that some essence of Marigold still exists somewhere in the world. It may do nothing ever again. And it could just be flowers, or it could be what\u2019s left of them because there happens to be eight flowers. And a couple of them kind of turn into each other. But I\u2019m leaving it to the audience to decide what it really means. Does that mean there could be more of the Umbrella Academy or is it just that a tiny bit of their essence does go on? Do you hope fans will find some comfort in seeing those? Blackman: I hope so. I also think some fans might be offended by it. I think it\u2019s the right ending \u2014 the right coda, I should say \u2014 for the end of the show. Why did you wait until this final season to explain how Ben died, and the Jennifer incident? Was there ever any version where they could just live happily ever after, and The Cleanse didn\u2019t happen? Blackman: No, the Jennifer incident was such a big thing in the graphic novel, and every year we played at how the kids felt this tremendous guilt. But they never discussed it, and they didn\u2019t realize they were brainwashed to feel like they were responsible and never to discuss it. So the fans definitely wanted to know what the Jennifer incident is. To be honest with you, Gerard and Gabriel [B\u00e1, illustrator] don\u2019t know what the Jennifer incident is. This is my interpretation of it. They\u2019re going to do something slightly different in their graphic novel. But they were very gracious and said, \u201cGo do your thing, and we\u2019re going to do our thing. Our graphic novel will continue past the show.\u201d I just thought it was a very important thing to end. It was one of the big mysteries of the season. Fans of the graphic novel especially wanted to know, but also the fans [of the show] wanted to know what happened to Ben. We all know Ben died, so I thought it was important to explain it. Did you always know how Ben died? And did Justin? Blackman: Justin didn\u2019t know until he read the scripts this year. I had a few conversations with him. But it really evolved. I knew Ben died, and I had different versions of it. I presented them to the writers, and together we came up with the final version of it. We talked about a lot of different ways it could have gone down, but this felt like the right way. Justin H. Min: I\u2019ve been like, \u201cSteve, are you ever going to tell us?\u201d And he did. He did. The thing is, everyone thinks we know. We don\u2019t know! We find out two days before we shoot the scene. I was like, \u201cWhoa!\u201d I was literally in my apartment in Toronto reading and screaming by myself. I was shocked, but I think it makes a lot of sense. Can you explain why and how the original timeline broke and why Abigail [Hargreeves\u2019 wife, played by Liisa Repo-Martell] feels like it\u2019s her responsibility to set it right? Blackman: The real idea was she created a God particle in her mind. And she didn\u2019t realize that, when she created the God particle, she created the anti-God particle. And it was too late to save her world. Whatever happened with Marigold and Durango in her world killed everyone. Anyone who could get away escaped. She died from it. Hargreeves [was] heartbroken, couldn\u2019t bear to see her die, so he took her with him. But he knew that Marigold was special and he thought Marigold was powerful enough to release. He had a plan that Marigold would eventually come to his aid. And it ended up being the essence of these immaculate conceptions of 43 women who were touched with Marigold on Earth and had these children, which he collected and kept seven of. So there was a plan afoot from him in the very beginning, to have these extra fighting units \u2014 extra-powerful people to help him in his crusade to get back his wife. I don\u2019t think he could control it the way he thought. And clearly, he couldn\u2019t control his kids. But he did release that Marigold in the hope that it would bring about these special children. He just didn\u2019t realize that Durango would come along with it. And that\u2019s why Abigail feels like it\u2019s her job to fix because she unleashed it. Blackman: Right. So she feels that she did the ultimate sin and said to him that she felt he had no right to bring her back. She didn\u2019t ask to be brought back. She believed she should have died for her sin. The original timeline broke [because] there was never supposed to be Marigold on Earth. And when the Marigold made its way from Hargreeves\u2019 home planet along with him to Earth \u2013\u2013 when it impregnated these women and they had these special children \u2013\u2013 that began the shattering of the timeline. So from the moment Marigold was released and these children were born, the timelines start to shatter and we became millions of alternate timelines. And the only way to put them back together was for them to cease to exist. What exactly happened to Hargreeves and Abigail\u2019s home planet? Blackman: Gone, destroyed ... It doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Very few people survived. Hargreeves and a few other people got away, and Abigail was saved, but everyone else suffered from The Cleanse disease. And The Cleanse did exactly what it did to Earth on that planet. [Because Marigold] and Durango together created The Cleanse monster, the same kind of thing. And their whole planet was consumed faster than ours was. Abigail was at fault because she created [Marigold], which she thought was powerful, not realizing she unleashed the anti of it at the same time. She was a wonderful scientist and probably smarter than Hargreeves. It\u2019s a major reveal that Hargreeves erased the kids\u2019 memories and he\u2019s the one that killed Ben. Did he really believe he was doing it for the greater good? Blackman: We have to remember, it wasn\u2019t this Hargreeves that shot Ben. It was the Hargreeves from the other timeline. I think this Hargreeves understands why it had to happen. In other words, he probably would\u2019ve done the same thing. Because he\u2019s willing now to kill Ben in this timeline because he says Ben and Jennifer can never be together. Durango and Marigold can never be together. So I think he would\u2019ve done the same thing. Does Klaus ever find out what happened to Ben since he wasn\u2019t there when their memories got restored? Blackman: We don\u2019t show it, but I assume that somewhere along that van ride, on the way there, someone says, \u201cWhat happened to Ben?\u201d And Klaus says, \u201cYeah, what happened to Ben?\u201d And [they say], \u201cWell, all right. He killed him. He erased our memory.\u201d I think that conversation happens off-screen. The fans will ask that question. Why did you want to pair up Lila and Five this season? Blackman: OK, so that\u2019s my big swing of the year that I\u2019m wondering if the fans will love or hate me for. I felt that Five had to have a love story. I mean, he\u2019s a 64-year-old man in the body of an 18-year-old. So we thought he could have a love story. And I thought, \u201cHow can he have a love story? He\u2019s not the kind of guy who\u2019s going to date.\u201d I thought Five needed to be with someone, whether it be a boy or girl. We thought we had an opportunity with Lila. And we tried it. I don\u2019t know how the fans are going to take it. I wanted him to kiss Lila because they\u2019re extreme opposites and they hate each other. But really, they are remarkably similar. They\u2019re both assassins, and they both went through the Commission. So they really do understand each other. And I thought, \u201cHow would we get them there?\u201d It would take years to get them to appreciate each other. And I thought, \u201cOK, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d I went and had them lost together for seven and a half, almost eight years together [to] see if something grows. And it did grow. By the time they kissed, they\u2019re so sweet at that point. You could believe that they would be together. We wouldn\u2019t let them rehearse the kiss. We got him to the point just before the kiss, and then we let them do [it] on the day and it was just perfect. Aidan Gallagher: Oh man. He has an unrelenting selflessness, but I guess you have to if the world\u2019s ending. It\u2019s the most important thing, so you\u2019ve just got to push forward. I think Five doesn\u2019t know who he is or how he relates to things. If he really digs down, he is in a dark place and so long as his family\u2019s OK, then that\u2019s the only thing on his list to check off. It makes this season really beautiful because his character arc [goes] from not having a purpose to the relationship with Lila giving him a purpose. It\u2019s really a beautiful thing to see a character go through. And I think it\u2019s really relatable as just a universal human struggle. That was definitely the emotional center for the season. You mentioned you hope the finale raises a lot of questions about being a superhero. What does being a superhero mean to you and to our Brellies? Blackman: It means different things to different people. Some people think of the more traditional way, someone who goes out and saves people and puts themselves first. I don\u2019t define it. I always saw this show as a dysfunctional family show. And I think they\u2019re gifted people who have different skill sets, but they do really care about each other and they do care about the people around them. They do try to save the world. They risk their lives many times in many iterations. So by that definition, I think they are superheroes. I\u2019m just not sure if they think of themselves as superheroes. What do you hope fans are feeling when they finish the finale? Blackman: I would love them to still love the family and not feel let down that we ended it the way we did because no one forced me to end it that way. I felt this was the right ending, and I hope the fans agree with me that this makes sense in the whole scope of the show, that this had to be the ending. They make the ultimate sacrifice to save everybody, and that really is a superhero thing. I hope the takeaway from the fans is that this is the right decision. But beyond that, I hope they love this family as much as I do. And even if they don\u2019t love the ending, they\u2019ll love the family for years to come. I\u2019m going to miss this family, and I think the fans will too. To that end, how do you feel now that it's over? Blackman: I\u2019m sad. It was such a wonderful part of my life. I\u2019m ready to go on to the next thing. But I\u2019ve never enjoyed writing characters as much as these guys. It just felt like this family lived in my head for eight years. So when it was over \u2014 and I think it\u2019s hitting me \u2014 it really is over. I miss thinking about their voices and what would they do in this scene and who would hang out with who and what happened to Luther, and [if] he\u2019s still stripping. I just had so much fun. I\u2019d dream about them and laugh and get up in the middle of the night and write something down. I had a lot of laughs. And everyone says it, but I just had such an amazing cast. They were so giving and good to each other and to me and the crew. We worked with most of the same crew [the whole] time. So it was a true family. I miss that the most. I miss all of them now, even. What will you miss most about the show? Hopper: Just the people. 100%. I\u2019ll miss getting to play this character with these guys. That\u2019s the biggest thing. Casta\u00f1eda: The comfort of knowing that I have another season with this character to come back to and to see where it goes. I\u2019ve learned so much from the people around me, the crew, the cast, the directors, the writers, the showrunner, Steve. It was like going to school every day, long hours, very intrinsic scenes and action sequences that I feel like just made me a better artist. Raver-Lampman: We really got to do everything in this from dramatic scenes to comedy, to green screens to action, to doing our own stunts, and learning weapons, and dancing, singing. I really got to just explore everything that I possibly could present as an actor on the show. It required everything, in the best way, and I loved having to draw on so many different aspects of who I am as an actor to be a part of the show. It\u2019s really remarkable. Robert Sheehan: The money! Ah, no. That\u2019s the joke answer. I won\u2019t not miss the wages, I\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019ll miss the people working on it, the atmosphere. The people that I found there were absolutely joyful and cheerful and having a laugh. So it was lovely. Gallagher: Like all things in life, you remember the best moments and you don\u2019t want change in the moment. You want to stay in it. So I\u2019ll look back at this the same way that I look back at everything in life and yeah, it was a beautiful chapter and an incredible privilege to have grown up as a person and as a dramatic actor within this context. I think I got really lucky. Min: The cast, our crew. I mean, they are really family \u2026 but I will miss being on set with them, laughing with them. All those times. Elliot Page: It just means so much to be here with the group of people that I\u2019ve spent the last many years with getting to be a part of this wonderful show. I really just am feeling so lucky and such gratitude that we got to have four seasons. I had the privilege of playing this incredible role and getting to connect with fans, and it\u2019s really nice. Arya: I will miss the cast and everyone involved. It\u2019s been just such a beautiful group of people. Not just the cast, but all the crew, all the creators, the fans. It\u2019s just made this experience unbelievable. Gerard Way: Honestly, I really loved just all their enthusiasm. It\u2019s a great group of people and they have fun. And because I was never standing in the way of that, on purpose, it was a choice. So it got to grow into this beautiful thing that was its own thing.

        "body": "It\u2019s time for Emily Cooper (Lily Collins) to update her language-learning app, because our favorite American in Paris is headed to new European destinations in Emily in Paris Season 4. Emily in Paris Season 3 ended on a\u00a0tr\u00e8s dramatic note \u2014 with American in Paris Emily Cooper (Collins) learning that her on-and-off flirt buddy/neighbor/chef Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) is expecting a baby with his on-and-off\u00a0girlfriend/Emily\u2019s friend Camille (Camille Razat). In Season 4, \u201cEmily finds herself with a busy travel schedule,\u201d creator Darren Star tells Tudum. \u201cFrom the French Alps to the piazzas of Rome, viewers will vicariously experience amazing new locations through Emily\u2019s eyes. Expect new characters, a lot more drama, romance, and a whole new language to try and master.\u201d And now that Emily\u2019s lived in Paris longer and has gotten to know her new friends even better, \u201cshe has that trust now,\u201d Collins tells Tudum. \u201cShe\u2019s created a safe space where she can be extra vulnerable. I love that now the glitzy side of her optimism can balance out with the reality of some vulnerability.\u201d Read on below to find out everything you need to know about Emily in Paris Season 4. Part 1 is available now, and Part 2 launches on Sept. 12. The show celebrated its return with a red carpet event in Los Angeles on Aug. 14, where lucky fans could experience the \u201cLens the Look\u201d Style Journey by Shop With Google activation, see the stars arrive on the red carpet, and watch the first three episodes in a theater. After the dramatic events of Camille and Gabriel\u2019s misbegotten wedding, Emily is reeling. (Wouldn\u2019t you be?) Emily has strong feelings for two men, but Gabriel is on the verge of becoming a father, and ex boyfriend Alfie\u2019s (Laviscount) worst fears about her and Gabriel have been confirmed. Unfortunately, Emily and Gabriel\u2019s chemistry is undeniable as they work together toward a Michelin star, but two big secrets threaten to undo everything they\u2019ve dreamed of. \u201cThese are two characters who are star-crossed lovers,\u201d Star said about Emily and Gabriel in an interview with Tudum for Season 3. \u201cThey have a lot of passion for one another. They have things that are getting in their way, but, at the same time, I feel like every season, in a strange kind of way, their relationship deepens.\u201d Meanwhile at work, Sylvie (Leroy-Beaulieu) is forced to confront a thorny dilemma from her past for the sake of her marriage as the Agence Grateau team navigates personnel shake-ups. And Mindy (Ashley Park) and the band are forced to get thrifty when they run out of funds preparing for Eurovision. As you can see in new photos, this season introduces another fresh element to Emily\u2019s Paris \u2014\u00a0namely, winter. Executive producer and director Andrew Fleming tells Tudum, \u201cWe\u2019re getting a different textural feel of Paris. It was fun to think about the city in a different way for scenes that are more dramatically oriented, and to see Paris not all sunny and flowery but to see it a little gray and cozier and people in coats and dark skies. It\u2019s just as beautiful during the winter, if not more so.\u201d Naturally, that includes lots of new layers, both sartorially and culturally. \u201cEmily is really coming into her own, asserting herself, becoming much stronger with a style that is reinterpreting Parisian fashion codes,\u201d costume designer Marylin Fitoussi tells Tudum. \u201cAnd our motto was obviously to have fun, but to take maximum risks.\u201d And don\u2019t forget, Emily has a Roman holiday in her future when she heads to Italy in Part 2, which Collins announced last year in a special video at the Tudum: A Global Fan Event. Collins stars as Emily Cooper, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu as Sylvie Grateau, Ashley Park as Mindy Chen, Bravo as Gabriel, Razat as Camille, Samuel Arnold as Julien, Bruno Gouery as Luc, William Abadie as Antoine Lambert, and Lucien Laviscount as Alfie. The cast gathered in Los Angeles to celebrate the show\u2019s return, and you can check out those photos above. Season 4\u2019s guest stars include: In the brand-new game coming to Netflix, you\u2019ll be immersed in the world of the show as you move from the United States to Paris to accept a job at an esteemed fashion magazine. Much like Emily, you\u2019ll quickly find that the City of Love is full of surprises, challenges, and stunning suitors. With the help of Emily, Mindy, Alfie, and Gabriel, you\u2019ll explore the city and find yourself in the process. Will you take every opportunity to land your dream job, and follow your heart? The game comes out the same day as Part 1 of Season 4. Stay tuned for more information about Emily in Paris Season 4."

        "body": "It\u2019s almost time to say goodbye to Thomas Shelby and his clan of Peaky Blinders, but before the final season of the acclaimed series wraps up, there are just a few more double crosses in store. And in order to keep track of just who\u2019s double-crossing whom, you\u2019ll need to be able to tell your Shelbys from your Solomonses. To help you in that mission, we\u2019ve pieced together a definitive guide to the criminal element of Birmingham.  Murphy plays the leading man and beating heart of Peaky Blinders, the head of the notorious Shelby crime family. In Season 6, he\u2019s reckoning with his failed suicide attempt and his continuing guilt over a failed assassination attempt that led to the death of his aunt Polly (Helen McCrory, whose tragic real-life passing hangs over this season). Murphy is well known for his long-running collaboration with Christopher Nolan in films like Inception, Dunkirk and Batman Begins (featuring Murphy\u2019s unforgettable pronunciation of the word \u201cBatman\u201d). He\u2019s also a deliriously sociopathic killer stalking Rachel McAdams in Red Eye. But perhaps his least-known role? Lead singer in the rock band Sons of Mr. Green Genes; the group even turned down a five-album record deal in favor of Murphy beginning his acting career.  As Arthur Shelby, Anderson begins Season 6 trapped in a spiraling drug addiction that jeopardizes his marriage and his relationship with brother and gang leader, Tommy. Anderson has also appeared in films such as Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, The Revenant and British historical drama \u201971. You can follow Anderson on Instagram.  Ada, the sole sister of the Shelby family, takes on new responsibilities in Season 6 as Tommy cares for his ill daughter. Rundle is known for films like The Midnight Sky and television shows like Episodes. But outside of the Peaky world, she\u2019s best known for her performance as Vicky, the estranged wife of Richard Madden\u2019s character on Bodyguard. You can follow Rundle on Instagram.  Arthur\u2019s wife, Linda, is a devout and loyal partner who, in Season 6, has nonetheless left her husband after dealing with his infidelity and the rampant criminal habits of his family for years. Phillips also played Venetia Scott on The Crown and Eliza Scarlet on Miss Scarlet and the Duke. You can follow Phillips on Instagram.  A cousin to the Shelby family and their Aunt Polly\u2019s biological son, Michael is on the warpath in Season 6, blaming Tommy for the death of his mother. Cole also played Joshua Cody on Animal Kingdom and made the leap to Hollywood blockbusters when he played a young John Cena in the ninth Fast & Furious film. You can follow Cole on Twitter and Instagram.  The rising star (most recently seen in The Northman and Last Night in Soho) plays Michael\u2019s ambitious American wife, who clashed with Tommy in Season 5 over the operation of the Peaky Blinders\u2019 company. She\u2019s also appeared in projects like the eerie and violent Thoroughbreds, young Barack Obama biopic Barry, and, of course, The Queen\u2019s Gambit. You can follow Taylor-Joy on Twitter and Instagram.  Tom Hardy loves to do silly voices. Think of his guttural murmur in Mad Max: Fury Road, his borderline incomprehensible growl in The Revenant or even his dual Muppet impressions in the Venom films. His role as Jewish gang leader Alfie Solomons in Peaky Blinders is no exception. You would be forgiven for believing that Hardy is an American putting on a Cockney drawl to have a laugh at British people\u2019s expense. But nope, he was born in London \u2014 he just likes to have some fun. You can follow Hardy on Instagram.  O\u2019Keeffe plays Tommy\u2019s second wife, an ex-prostitute struggling to keep their family together as Tommy pines after his deceased first wife, Grace. O\u2019Keeffe previously played a London superheroine on Misfits and appeared as the subject of a Holmes and Watson mystery in the Sherlock special \u201cThe Abominable Bride.\u201d  The youngest Shelby sibling, Finn ended the previous season by accidentally leaking the Peaky Blinders\u2019 assassination plan to their enemies. Kirton is a relative newcomer to acting; Peaky Blinders is his first major role. You can follow Kirton on Twitter and Instagram.  The chameleonic Claflin plays a fascist leader and one of the Blinders\u2019 most dangerous opponents. After surviving their attempt on his life in Season 5, Mosley is only more determined to drive wedges between the family. Claflin is also known for his fan-favorite role as Finnick in The Hunger Games series, as well as for his performance as Mycroft Holmes in Enola Holmes. You can follow Claflin on Twitter and Instagram.  A new addition to the Peaky ensemble, Graham plays Hayden Stagg, a union official who takes on the Blinders when he steals drugs from their operation. Graham is no stranger to crime sagas; he\u2019s appeared in films like Snatch, Gangs of New York and, of course, The Irishman (where he was memorably scolded by Al Pacino for wearing shorts to a business meeting). You can follow Graham on Twitter and Instagram. "

Because an unforgettable masquerade ball is coming to Mayfair \u2014 and with it, Benedict as the lead of Bridgerton Season 4. That\u2019s right, the man who once mooed from the corner of the ballroom is about to be the focal point of the marriage mart as he searches for a mysterious woman called the Lady in Silver. \u201cBenedict has always been a little lost \u2014 or free depending on the way you want to look at it.

Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) and Colin (Luke Newton) must be proud. Showrunner Jess Brownell is \u201cvery excited\u201d to glide into Benedict\u2019s upcoming love story after following his growth for three seasons. \u201cIt felt important for him to explore the fullness of himself before he settles down,\u201d she tells Tudum. \u201cHe is someone who has big appetites, and we wanted to see him living a big life before he goes into settle-down mode.\u201d Now what could that more quiet life look like for Benedict? \u201cI\u2019m excited for where we\u2019re going with him in Season 4. There are a lot of things I want to say about it, but I should probably wait \u2026 ,\u201d Brownell teases. The upcoming season of Bridgerton will be eight episodes. Although Benedict will lead Bridgerton Season 4, he\u2019s not the only family member with a busy love life. So, as we wait to see where everyone\u2019s journeys of passion, scandal, and surprise send them next, let\u2019s take a refresher, with a little help from Brownell and the rest of the cast.\u00a0And, if you want a status update on all the weddings and breakups of the last few season, you can get a rundown here. After years as a widow, the ton\u2019s most romantic mama may be ready for someone to tend to her garden. The dowager viscountess has instant chemistry with Lord Marcus Anderson (Daniel Francis), brother of Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh). In the Season 3 finale, Violet invites Marcus to Francesca\u2019s (Hannah Dodd) tight-knit wedding and shares a dance with him during the Dankworth-Finch Ball. In the latter episodes of Season 3, the viscount and viscountess travel to India in preparation for their birth of their first child. As with their honeymoon, Anthony leaves the duties of the viscounty in the capable hands of his oldest brother, Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson). Season 4\u2019s star is returning to Mayfair with a whole new understanding of himself. Through a relationship with Lady Tilley Arnold (Hannah New) and Paul Suarez (Lucas Aurelio), Benedict has realized he has more romantic possibilities than he expected. It doesn\u2019t matter if \u201cPatricia, or Polly, or Peter, or all three at once\u201d are in front of him. \u201cHis identity has been little bit of a question mark, but it doesn\u2019t ever seem to really bother him,\u201d Thompson tells Tudum. \u201cIt often feels like \u2026 \u2018You\u2019re either this, or you\u2019re this.\u2019 He\u2019s finding it out.\u201d But, Brownell explains, Benedict is far more \u201copen-minded\u201d than his peers. \u201cSeason 3 also puts him in a place where he\u2019s really exploring more sides of himself,\u201d she says. \u201cI think he feels things very deeply.\u201d As Bridgerton has taught us, every great romantic hero does need to be in touch with his truest emotions. Season 3\u2019s central lovers have gotten their happily-ever-after moment. Penelope has revealed herself as Lady Whistledown (with Queen Charlotte\u2019s blessing, no less), married her long-time crush, and become the mother of the next Lord Featherington. Colin is soaking in the brilliance of his wife and also enjoying his own writing success, with the publication of his book, Traveling with Myself. Newton and Coughlan can\u2019t wait to see Polin bask in their joy. \u201cWhen you go through your season, there\u2019s always twists and turns because it\u2019s interesting to watch,\u201d Newton tells Tudum. \u201cBut once you\u2019ve had your moment, it\u2019s really nice to see how they\u2019ll navigate married life. It\u2019ll be a place of comfort for them and they\u2019ll really enjoy it.\u201d But it\u2019s still possible some scandal could be lurking in Season 4. As Penelope points out, the queen\u2019s (Golda Rosheuvel) favor could disappear at any moment as she continues to write Lady Whistledown under her own name. \u201cLady Whistledown has been Penelope the whole time,\u201d Coughlan says. \u201cShe has finally accepted, \u2018Yeah, that is me. And you know what? I'm really proud of it. Look what I achieved.\u2019 She stands in her power. It's great.\u201d So, with royal eyes watching, \u201cit\u2019ll never be just chill and quiet,\u201d Newton says. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what happens with all that.\u201d Eloise (Claudia Jessie) \u00a0is sailing into Season 4 curious about what else the world has to offer. She spent Season 3 giving the ton her very best, and still found the balls and lemonade lacking. So she decides to accompany Francesca and her new husband Lord John Stirling (Victor Alli) to the latter\u2019s primary property in Scotland. Jessie believes a social season without Penelope\u2019s friendship gave Eloise the independence she required for the voyage. \u201cThat was the courage that she needed to then be like, \u2018I\u2019m going to go to Scotland with my sister, forever third-wheeling,\u2019 \u201d Jessie tells Tudum. Scotland is welcoming a new set of newlyweds. Francesca and John are going to the Highlands with Eloise \u2026 and John\u2019s cousin, Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza), a gender-swapped take on Michael Stirling, who appears in the book When He Was Wicked. \u201cBridgerton book readers will know what it means when Francesca meets Michaela at the end of Season 3,\u201d Brownell says. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait to see, going forward, what we do with that.\u201d Well, that is easier than winning a game of cards against Gregory Bridgerton (Will Tilston). Just keep coming right back here to Tudum for all your Bridgerton (and Benedict) news."

The series, inspired by the Guy Ritchie movie of the same name, is coming back to Netflix for a deeper look into the criminal underbelly of aristocratic Britain. The Gentlemen follows Eddie (Theo James), who becomes the new Duke of Halstead following his father\u2019s death. In addition to the new title, Eddie also inherits the family\u2019s sizable country estate \u2014 and the illegal weed farm located underneath it, run by the sophisticated yet ruthless Susie (Kaya Scodelario) and her crime boss father Bobby Glass (Ray Winstone). Although hesitant to join the criminal lifestyle at first, he develops a taste for it and finds an unexpected ally in Susie as they face down the UK and Europe\u2019s most notorious and hilarious gangster families. And by the end of the first eight episodes, Eddie solidifies himself as co-owner \u2014\u00a0along with Susie and Bobby \u2014\u00a0of the Glass\u2019 massive weed empire. James, Scodelario, and Daniel Ings \u2014 who plays Eddie\u2019s brother Freddy \u2014 are confirmed to reprise their roles in the eight-episode second season, and additional casting news will be announced at a later date. Ritchie is returning to direct, and will co-write the series with Matthew Read. Filming is expected to commence next year. What will happen in Season 2? That\u2019s still up in the air. \u201cIt\u2019d be fun to see the business spread a bit more,\u201d Scodelario told Tudum when the show launched. \u201cHow do they take it to the next level? They\u2019re very adamant about not getting into the chop game, so how do they then continue to build the empire? Where does that take them? How does the new structure of the business work practically?\u201d Eddie and Susie are now partners, but how will their relationship evolve as the story moves forward? \u201cI think they\u2019ve grown to love each other in their own way, but I think they\u2019ll never fully trust each other because they are so different and they\u2019re from such vastly different worlds,\u201d James told Tudum. \u201cThere\u2019s a love between them, but ultimately they will never be from the same cloth.\u201d The Gentlemen is produced by Moonage Pictures for Netflix and Miramax Television. Executive producers include Ritchie; Will Gould, Read, and Frith Tiplady for Moonage Pictures; Marc Helwig for Miramax Television; and Ivan Atkinson."

        "body": "You might want to put down the windows, because it\u2019s getting hot in this ride \u2014 and, no, it\u2019s not the LA heat. New episodes of The Lincoln Lawyer roll out on Oct. 17. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo returns as Mickey Haller in the legal drama with 10 new episodes based on The Gods of Guilt, the fifth book in\u00a0The Lincoln Lawyer series by Michael Connelly. (Showrunners Dailyn Rodriguez and Ted Humphrey agree it may also be Connelly\u2019s best book of that era.) \u201cThis season is very exciting,\u201d Garcia-Rulfo tells Tudum. \u201cWe see Mickey struggling with so many things at the same time \u2014 with romance, with the wives, with the cases. You never expect what's going to happen, who's going to be bad and who's going to be guilty.\u201d Want a sneak peek into this case file? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Season 3. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3. The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 welcomes four new cast members: They\u2019ll star alongside returning cast members Becki Newton (Lorna), Jazz Raycole (Izzy), Angus Sampson (Cisco), and DaCosta (Andrea). Neve Campbell (Maggie), Elliott Gould (Legal Siegel), Krista Warner (Hayley), Fiona Rene (Glory Days), and Devon Graye (Julian La Cosse) will also be back this season. Yes. Check out Mickey, Lorna, Cisco, Izzy and more in action above. Last season, Mickey\u2019s ex-wife Maggie was offered a job with the DA\u2019s office in San Diego and decided to move there. But she \u201ccontinues to be on the personal axis of Mickey's life,\u201d Humphrey tells Tudum. Adds Garcia-Rulfo, \u201cEven if she\u2019s not there, [she\u2019s] always in the back of his being. There\u2019s always something about Maggie that\u2019s there. When he meets new girls, I think he\u2019s always feeling that he\u2019s cheating on her.\u201d In these Season 3 first-look photos, she appears in a flashback scene. \u201cWe decided that a fun (and poignant) way to come into the season would be via a flashback sequence that gave us some insight into how Mickey Haller became Mickey Haller \u2014 not just the brilliant criminal defense lawyer, but the husband, the father, and the man that he would come to be,\u201d Humphrey and Rodriguez told Netflix. Although Connelly\u2019s fifth book doesn\u2019t include a flashback, the showrunners felt it was a fitting introduction to the new season, adding, \u201cThese images of a young Mickey finishing up surfing before a life-changing day at work, as well as cuddling on the couch with his wife Maggie after putting their young daughter Hayley to bed, are from a pair of these flashback scenes that bookend the first episode and propel us into the rest of Season 3.\u201d If you loved the series\u2019 grand tour of LA\u2019s hottest restaurants and old haunts, we\u2019ve got a treat for you. \u201cWe shout out some great LA places,\u201d says Rodriguez about Season 3. \u201cWe\u2019re shouting out La Monarca Bakery, which is a really big Mexican bakery in LA. We have the Philippe\u2019s [vs.] Cole\u2019s French dip debate.\u201d \u201cOh, we shoot at Nobu,\u201d Humphrey adds, calling out Malibu\u2019s pricey sushi spot. While the series is shot on location throughout the LA area, from the stunning Zuma Beach to the architectural marvels of downtown, Garcia-Rulfo says the scenes at real restaurants add another dimension. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the city; the food gives it another character,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a trademark of the show. Mickey\u2019s a foodie!\u201d Mickey is a Lincoln Navigator man, but Season 3 showcases some sweet new cars, including flashback to the budding lawyer\u2019s OG ride: the humble, beachy convertible Volkswagen. But there\u2019s another convertible that has a special place in Garcia-Rulfo\u2019s heart: Mickey\u2019s powder-blue 1963 Lincoln Continental. \u201cShooting nights in that convertible, in that Lincoln, is so cool,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to take that. I\u2019m hoping at the end, Netflix is like, \u2018Manuel, this is your wrap present.\u2019 \u201d The second season of\u00a0The Lincoln Lawyer\u00a0premiered on July 6, 2023, and quickly climbed up the Netflix Global Top 10 with a cumulative 40\u00a0million views as of Aug. 29, 2023, reaching the Top 10 in 81 countries. Last season, Mickey found himself in a messy situation, on both professional and personal fronts. When beguiling restaurateur and activist Lisa Trammell (Lana Parrilla) was accused of murdering a prominent city developer, Mickey was tasked with proving her innocence. Complicating matters was the fact that lawyer and client were romantically involved \u2014 before they started working together, of course! Although Lisa was found not guilty, her sketchy past eventually caught up with her and jeopardized any potential relationship with Mickey. It seems the hotshot lawyer can navigate most obstacles at this point, but Season 3 will hit close to home. In the final moments of Season 2, Mickey learns that his friend Glory Days (Fiona Rene), with whom he previously worked on Season 1\u2019s Jesus Menendez case, is dead. \u201cThis one is personal, because it\u2019s a client that he actually really cared about and thought she had gotten out of that life and out of danger,\u201d says Rodriguez. \u201cMickey very much is [wondering], \u2018Did he have something to do with this? Could he have done more to help her?\u2019 \u201d Executive producer Ross Fineman told Tudum the case is going to be Mickey\u2019s toughest, both professionally and personally. \u201cThis was his friend,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\u2019s a nagging sense that he might have been responsible in some way.\u201d Mickey has a new singular focus after Glory\u2019s death. He has become a \u201cman on fire\u201d says Rodriguez. \u201cWe\u2019re past the broken Mickey from Season 1 that has to get his sea legs again. In Season 2 \u2014 we liked to call that the Icarus season \u2014 he got all the fame and fortune, [he] really flew a little high to the sun and got burned a little bit. [Now he\u2019s] a man on a mission, much more than the other two seasons.\u201d All episodes of The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 arrive Oct. 17, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get your fix of courtroom drama and LA food tours while you wait. Stream the first two seasons of The Lincoln Lawyer on Netflix now."

The epic story of five extraordinary South Londoners ended its first season with a heartbreaking stunner. \u201cWhen I come back, they\u2019re all gonna fucking pay,\u201d Michael (Tosin Cole) vows to his superpowered allies Andre (Eric Kofi Abrefa), Rodney (Calvin Demba), Sabrina (Nadine Mills), and Tazer (Josh Tedeku). The \u201cthey\u201d Michael\u2019s referencing are a shadowy organization that\u2019s been stalking, manipulating, and, in some cases, killing supacell holders. For the show\u2019s creator, Rapman, what comes next in the story isn\u2019t a mystery. \u201cI\u2019ve always had it [mapped out] to Season 3. I know how Season 2 ends,\u201d he told Tudum before the series premiered, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve got stuff planned for this story. I\u2019ve had this in my head for years, so I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d Throughout Season 1 \u2014 which reached the No. 1 spot in Netflix\u2019s global TV series list and remained in the top 10 for six weeks \u2014 Michael isn\u2019t just a proven good guy. He\u2019s also the anchor who brings Sabrina, Tazer, Rodney, and Andre together, just as his future self instructed him to do. While Rapman calls Michael a \u201cwarm, likable character,\u201d he acknowledges that the time-and-space-transcending hero\u2019s gut-wrenching loss might change his personality. \u201cYou can have the nicest person in the world. You push that person too far, and that person has the extraordinary power? You could create something very dangerous,\u201d he said. Each of the five heroes has their own personal problems \u2013\u2013 while struggling to wield a special ability \u2013\u2013 but Rapman says they\u2019re only getting started. \u201cSupacell Season 1 is my Batman Begins. It\u2019s a prequel of what they\u2019ll be like. Season 2 is when you really see what they become. That future you saw at the end of the pilot in London, that exact future doesn\u2019t exist anymore. They\u2019ve changed everything. It\u2019s going to be interesting when we get into the writers\u2019 room.\u201d For future updates on Supacell check back here on Tudum."

On Thursday, almost five months after production on the thriller\u2019s fifth and final season began in New York, Penn Badgley (he/him) shared a video of himself going to set for his last day of work. Where\u2019s his head at he approaches the end of his time as Joe? Well, as you can see below, he\u2019s being \u201cvery demure\u201d and \u201cvery mindful.\u201d Based on\u00a0the novels by Caroline Kepnes,\u00a0You\u00a0centers on Joe, a book-loving, hopeless romantic with a penchant for stalking and killing the women he (claims to) love, as well as anyone else who gets in his way. While Joe\u2019s search for The One began in New York, it took him first to Los Angeles in Season 2, then to the suffocating suburbs of San Francisco in Season 3 and most recently London in the just-launched fourth season. There across the pond, the genre-hopping drama threw him into a\u00a0one-percent skewering whodunit that forced him to finally accept he\u2019s not a good man \u2014 an undeniable truth he avoided for far too long. At the\u00a0season\u2019s conclusion, Joe returned to New York City with his wealthy partner Kate and a dangerous new lease on life \u2014 a life he\u2019s finally admitted is fundamentally immoral, something that Badgley is excited about exploring. While there are very few details about the final season, we do know it will introduce Joe\u2019s new extended family. Griffin Matthews (he/him,The Flight Attendant) has been cast as the brother of Joe\u2019s new wife Kate (Charlotte Ritchie), while Anna Camp (she/her, Hysteria!) will be playing two roles \u2014 Kate\u2019s identical twin sisters.\u00a0They join Madeline Brewer (she/her, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale) as a young woman who makes Joe reconsider his new life. Read on for everything you need to know about the final season. L-R: Madeline Brewer, Griffin Matthews, Anna Camp In addition to Badgley and Ritchie (she/her), there\u2019s Brewer, who will play Bronte, an enigmatic and free-spirited playwright who gets a job at Joe\u2019s new bookstore. As the two connect over literature and loss, Bronte stokes in Joe a nostalgia for his former self, causing him to question everything his life has become. Matthews is playing Teddy Lockwood, Joe\u2019s snarky yet loyal brother-in-law. A confidante who was never fully accepted by the Lockwood family, Teddy brings authenticity and empathy to a family for whom such things are a foreign concept. Camp is pulling double duty as Raegan and Maddie Lockwood, Joe\u2019s twin sisters-in-law. Raegan is the cunning, cutthroat CFO of the Lockwood Corp who has her eyes on the throne and will crush any adversary\u2026 be they family or not. Maddie, on the other hand, presents as the unserious twin, a thrice-divorced socialite whose job is \u201cvaguely PR.\u201d But make no mistake, a master manipulator lies beneath Maddie\u2019s frivolous fa\u00e7ade. Season 5\u2019s recurring cast includes: As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Badgley previously teased at\u00a0Tudum: A Global Fan Event that a familiar face from Joe\u2019s past will come back to haunt him in Season 5, creating problems for his Big Apple homecoming. \u201cThere are many loose ends in Joe\u2019s past,\u201d says Badgley in the video above, as we\u2019re treated to clips of several people Joe has wronged over the past four seasons. For example, there\u2019s the falsely imprisoned Dr. Nicky (John Stamos) from Season 1, orphaned Ellie (Jenna Ortega) from Season 2 and the bougie Conrads (Shalita Grant and Travis Van Winkle) from Season 3, just to name a few. At this point, however, Badgley can\u2019t reveal which one of Joe\u2019s surviving victims will return in Season 5. When Tudum spoke to Badgley before Season 4 debuted, he said he was excited about exploring this new and fully integrated version of Joe. \u201cI think it sets us up to actually have a really great finale season,\u201d said Badgley in an interview with Tudum ahead of Season 4\u2019s debut. \u201cCan his inner monologue evolve some now? What does it mean for him to accept himself?\u201d (And how will his planned new bookstore fare in the city\u2019s unforgiving retail market?) While\u00a0Penn Badgley\u2019s anti-hero never could\u2019ve predicted where his quest for true love would take him, the same can\u2019t be said for the show\u2019s creative team, because they \u201calways conceived it as a five-season journey,\u201d executive producers Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter said in a statement in March. Executive producer Sera Gamble, who created\u00a0You with Berlanti, is stepping down as showrunner for Season 5 to focus on developing other projects. In her stead, longtime\u00a0You writers Michael Foley, who\u2019s been with the series since Season 1, and Justin W. Lo, who joined in Season 2, will take over showrunning duties. \u201cAs I step back from day-to-day showrunning to focus on new projects, I\u2019m immensely grateful to co-creator and all-around genius Greg Berlanti, Caroline Kepnes, my friends at Berlanti Productions and Alloy Entertainment, and our steadfast partners at Warner Bros and Netflix,\u201d said Gamble. \u201cMaking the show alongside our writers, producers, directors, cast and crew has been an honor and ridiculously fun. And I feel lucky to have worked with an artist as gifted and thoughtful as Penn Badgely. I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve all accomplished and feel privileged to pass the torch. I\u2019m excited to watch and support the\u00a0You team as they bring Joe Goldberg\u2019s journey to its delightfully twisted conclusion.\u201d In their statement, Berlanti and Schechter thanked Gamble for stewarding the show and said they look forward to working with Foley and Lo. \u201cWe are so incredibly grateful to Netflix and Sera and everyone that has been a part of this show from the beginning. Sera is the most brilliant writer and partner and she will remain a key part of the\u00a0You family as an executive producer. We intend to bring her every idea we can from our company for years to come,\u201d said Berlanti and Schechter. \u201cWe are excited to continue our relationship with Mike and Justin as they take over the reins as co-showrunners and prepare to bring Joe Goldberg home.\u201d Foley and Lo added, \u201cWorking with Greg and Sera on\u00a0You has been a highlight of our careers and we\u2019re incredibly honored to be entrusted with the final chapter of Joe Goldberg\u2019s story.\u201d You\u2019s audience grew over the course of its first three seasons, with each one adding more viewing hours through 28 days than the one before it. So far, the fourth season has spent five weeks on the Global Top 10 English TV list and reached the Top 10 in 90 countries. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to see how\u00a0You has captivated audiences around the world, becoming an instant sensation on Netflix with a resounding cultural impact that has grown season over season,\u201d said Peter Friedlander, vice president of scripted series, Netflix, US and Canada. \u201cWe\u2019re excited \u2014 and a bit terrified \u2014 to see how it all ends for Joe Goldberg, but one thing is for sure:\u00a0You are in for an unforgettable ending.\u201d Will Joe finally face judgment? You\u2019ll have to wait until\u00a0You\u00a0returns to find out. In the meantime, keep coming back to Tudum for more news."

As is true in sports, the body is an artist\u2019s most precious asset, and to be successful, they must hone it relentlessly and tirelessly so it can perform to near perfection. The docuseries Pop Star Academy: KATSEYE follows a group of some of the most talented young women on the planet as they train for a spot on the dream team: K-pop juggernaut HYBE and major US record label Geffen Records\u2019 global girl group, KATSEYE. The catch? There are only six spots. When we first meet the finalists \u2014 referred to as \u201ctrainees\u201d \u2014\u00a0in the series, these women already have something to be immensely proud of. They\u2019re the final batch of 20-odd contestants, chosen from a submission pool of over 120,000 young people from around the world. Each were selected because of their innate talents \u2014 whether it be singing, dancing, sometimes both, or just embodying that elusive \u201cstar quality.\u201d But being great isn\u2019t enough \u2014 even though they will be US-based, they\u2019re being trained in the K-pop way. The young women must go through rigorous training to become the best of the best, with the hope of becoming all-rounders which will make them indispensable to the group of seasoned coaches and producers who hold their fate in their hands. Needless to say, the panel have their work cut out for them \u2014 especially since so much of making a girl group is about finding cohesion among a group of very unique talents.

        "body": "Reunited and it feels so good: On Aug. 18 at 2 p.m. EST, Jake Paul and Mike Tyson faced off at the inaugural Fanatics Fest NYC, an immersive festival for sports fans, pop culture fiends, and collectors. The pair participated in a press conference hosted by renowned journalist and Super Bowl Champion Ryan Clark. For those who need a fight refresher: The much-anticipated heavyweight fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson has been rescheduled for Friday, Nov. 15, 2024, and will stream live on Netflix from the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. A rematch between fighters Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano is also rescheduled for the same day. In early summer 2024, Tyson had to pause his training on doctor\u2019s orders after an ulcer flare-up. At Fanatics Fest, he revealed he\u2019s been back in training for two or three weeks and is ready to show up strong on Nov. 15. \u201cI\u2019m very prepared [to knock out Jake Paul],\u201d Tyson said. \u201cI had a small adversity. I got sick, but I feel good. \u2026 I\u2019m just ready. I\u2019m going to do my talk, and I\u2019m going to talk my shit, but I\u2019m ready to fight.\u201dThe Nov. 15 bout is Jake Paul\u2019s most-anticipated fight to date and his third fight of 2024, following three sensational knockouts against professional boxers and Golden Glove winners Andre August and Ryan Bourland, as well as BKFC champion Mike Perry, on July 20. Paul has shown tremendous growth as a boxer on his path to becoming a world champion, but now he takes on one of the best and most dangerous boxers of all time in Mike Tyson. \u201cThis is taking the chance to fight somebody as vicious as Mike can be,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou got to risk it for the biscuit. That\u2019s the name of the game. I\u2019m here to make history. I\u2019m here for a challenge. I\u2019m here to fight one of the most dangerous men in all of boxing. No one that ever did anything great got there with ease or by an easy, non-bumpy road. I'm here to challenge myself. He\u2019s vicious. He\u2019s a killer. I know all of these things. He has one-punch knockout power. He\u2019s the greatest heavyweight of all time. But I will prove [...] all the haters wrong.\u201d Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions, said, \u201cOur team has worked diligently with all parties involved to reschedule this monumental fight to a date that ensures both Jake Paul and Mike Tyson are fully prepared, with equal training time, as well as allowing us to keep the event at AT&T stadium in the midst of the Cowboys season. We appreciate the outstanding dedication, collaboration, and flexibility of our partners at Netflix and AT&T Stadium. Paul vs. Tyson is the most cross generational sporting event in history, and we are committed to providing fans worldwide with this unforgettable night of boxing, live globally on Netflix. We look forward to seeing everyone on Friday, Nov. 15, for a showdown that will be talked about for generations to come.\u201d On May 31, MVP announced the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson live boxing event would be postponed from its original date of July 20 to accommodate Tyson\u2019s pause in training. At the time, Iron Mike told Netflix. \u201cMy body is in better overall shape than it has been since the 1990s, and I will be back to my full training schedule soon. Jake Paul, this may have bought you some time, but in the end you will still be knocked out and out of boxing for good. I appreciate everyone\u2019s patience and can\u2019t wait to deliver an unforgettable performance later this year.\u201d \u201cI fully support postponing the event so Mike Tyson has no excuses come fight night,\u201d Paul told Netflix then.\u00a0\u201cMy fans know I don\u2019t want to face Iron Mike at anything but his best, but let there be no mistake \u2014 when he steps into the ring with me, I will be ready to claim my W with a sensational finish. Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson will be one for the ages, and I promise to bring my best for this once-in-a-lifetime matchup.\u201d For more information about the fight, read on. For the first time ever, Netflix and Most Valuable Promotions (MVP) are teaming up for a heavyweight boxing mega-event headlined by the Problem Child, Jake \u201cEl Gallo de Dorado\u201d Paul (9-1, 6 KOs), versus the Baddest Man on the Planet, Mike Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs). In the co-main event, undisputed super lightweight world champion Katie Taylor (23-1, 6 KOs) will step back in the ring against boxing trailblazer and unified featherweight champion Amanda \u201cThe Real Deal\u201d Serrano (46-2-1, 30 KOs). Paul and Tyson \u00a0last met face-to-face on May 13 at the iconic Apollo Theater in New York City to discuss the upcoming fight during an event with Taylor and Serrano, hosted by renowned boxing journalist Ariel Helwani. \u201cMike wanted this to be a pro fight,\u201d Paul said during the press conference. \u201cHe wants the war. I respect him for stepping up and try to put an end to me.\u201d Tyson praised Paul\u2019s character, but didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cI really like Jake a lot,\u201d Tyson told the crowd, \u201cBut once he\u2019s in the ring he has to fight like his life depends on it \u2014 because it will.\u201d Unified featherweight champion Serrano spoke to the challenge of ascending three divisions to fight Taylor in a lightweight rematch, which requires her to gain about 14 pounds. \u201cGreatness requires sacrifice,\u201d Serrano said. \u201cI\u2019m sacrificing my body to go up three divisions. My power is going to come with me.\u201d Taylor said \u00a0she has no plans to carry on the Serrano vs. Taylor rivalry after the fight later this year. Their infamous 2022 bout at Madison Square Garden ended in a narrow split decision in Taylor\u2019s favor, earning Sports Illustrated\u2019s Fight of the Year and The Ring\u2019s Event of the Year for 2022. \u201cI go into every fight planning to win,\u201d Taylor said when asked if she was planning to put the rivalry to bed. \u201cI beat her the first time, and I plan on beating her [a] second time. [A] trilogy is not on my mind right now.\u201d Despite speculation that Paul vs. Tyson would be an unofficial exhibition match, MVP and Holden Boxing announced on April 29 that the heavyweight boxing mega-event will be a professional fight, sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulations (TDLR). The matchup will be contested over eight two-minute rounds with 14-ounce gloves and no headgear. \u201cMike Tyson and Jake Paul signed on to fight each other with the desire to do so in a sanctioned professional fight that would have a definitive outcome,\u201d MVP\u2019s Bidarian told Netflix. He added that the decision to have two-minute rounds instead of three (the typical length for men\u2019s boxing) was to stay true to MVP\u2019s belief that the parameters of sanctioned matches should be determined by the fight (as opposed to adhering to traditional men\u2019s vs. women\u2019s rules). On May 21, it was announced that India\u2019s No. 1 boxer and MVP\u2019s first international signee Neeraj Goyat (18-4-2, 8 KOs) will fight Brazil\u2019s Whindersson Nunes (2-2-1, 1 KO) in a professional six-round super middleweight bout contested at 165 pounds. The fight will be Goyat\u2019s MVP debut. Also announced on the Paul vs. Tyson card is a fight between Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. and Darren Till. Scheduled for six rounds in the cruiserweight division, the event will be UK UFC star Till\u2019s professional boxing debut against former WBC middleweight Ch\u00e1vez Jr (53-6-1, 1 NC), the son of Mexican boxing legend Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez. Finally, there will be a 10-round lightweight fight between undefeated prospects Ashton \u201cH2O\u201d Sylve (11-0, 9 KOs) and Floyd \u201cKid Austin\u201d Schofield (17-0, 12 KOs). Tyson\u2019s last sanctioned match took place in 2005 against Irish boxer Kevin McBride. The fight lasted six rounds, and McBride was declared the winner by TKO. However, Tyson\u2019s last exhibition match was much more recent. In May 2021, he faced Evander Holyfield in Miami. The fight went the full eight rounds and ended in a draw. Despite Tyson\u2019s long career, he says Paul\u2019s short time in boxing shouldn\u2019t be an indicator of what he\u2019ll bring to the match. \u201c[Jake has] grown significantly as a boxer over the years,\u201d Tyson says of his opponent, who turned pro in 2020 and was the subject of the documentary anthology series UNTOLD: Jake Paul the Problem Child. \u201cIt will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a \u2018kid\u2019 can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT.\u201d Paul acknowledges he\u2019s moved up fast. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think that in my second pro fight, I went viral for knocking out Nate Robinson on Mike Tyson\u2019s undercard,\u201d Paul told Netflix. \u201cNow, less than four years later, I\u2019m stepping up to face Tyson myself to see if I have what it takes to beat one of boxing\u2019s most notorious fighters and biggest icons.\u201d Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson will be Netflix\u2019s third live sports event, following\u00a0The Netflix Cup and\u00a0The Netflix Slam."

        "body": "When Rebel Ridge\u2019s Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) cycles into a small town on a mission of mercy, he has no idea what he\u2019s getting himself into. The ex-Marine is there to bail out his cousin, currently under arrest. But before he can even reach the courthouse, Terry is hurled off his bike and into the center of a vast conspiracy that implicates every level of the town of Shelby Springs \u2014 and it\u2019ll take all of his skills to get out. Rebel Ridge\u2019s writer-director Jeremy Saulnier\u00a0(Green Room,\u00a0Hold the Dark) told Netflix, \u201cAs a filmmaker, I dig grounded \u201980s and \u201990s action films that not only deliver on spectacle, but succeed in tying on-screen mayhem to a real and true emotional component. Smaller scale, bigger impact. Less veneer, less artificiality. They\u2019re rooted in a \u2018kick up the dust\u2019 level of craft and authenticity that I don\u2019t see often in the current space, and I was interested in making a film more like that.\u201d At the heart of that film is Pierre\u2019s character, a man who embodies the grounded qualities that Saulnier values so highly \u2014 as does Pierre himself. \u201cI would describe Terry as endlessly centered,\u201d Pierre said of the character. \u201cYou need to navigate and manage the situations that he does in this movie with such composure.\u201d To say anything more would be to spoil the movie\u2019s many twists and turns. For Pierre, Rebel Ridge was a dream come true. \u201cJust to be gifted the opportunity to play a character so nuanced and layered and complex and deeply human as Terry Richmond is undeniable,\u201d Pierre told Netflix. \u201cThese opportunities don\u2019t come by your desk every day. So when they do, you grab it with both hands, you embrace it, and you pull yourself into the character and the creation of said project. I also learned so very much every single day working with the tremendous talent that is Jeremy Saulnier. And the script, which Jeremy also wrote,\u00a0was undeniable for me. And that\u2019s not a word that I use lightly.\u201d For Saulnier, the opportunity was mutually exciting. \u201cI was asking for the world. Someone young, with a vibrance to them. But they needed next-level chops. A depth, a cerebral weight that\u2019s hard to find along with the physicality the role demanded. Someone who could surprise you when they revealed Terry\u2019s true skill set, but would make perfect sense when utilizing it. Not many actors can check that box.\u201d But Saulnier explained: \u201cMy wife had seen [Pierre] in Barry Jenkins\u2019 limited series The Underground Railroad and he had been pitched to me by his agent. At a sturdy 6-foot- 3, I thought he\u2019d be too imposing for what I had in mind for the role. Dude\u00a0vibes superhero, and that\u2019s not what I normally gravitate towards, but we hopped on a Zoom and within two minutes I knew he was the guy. He was striking. His intelligence and thoughtfulness were intimidating. He was quiet and cool, deeply respectful and passionate. He has a serene nature to his soul. His physicality still vibed superhero but I was like, \u2018Fuck it \u2014 he\u2019s a superhero\u2019. And Aaron was, on-screen and off. It was an absolute thrill to find each other at the perfect time in our lives and our careers.\u201d Written and directed by Saulnier, Rebel Ridge is a pulse-pounding thriller about how far one man will go for justice. Read on for a first look at the film, and stay tuned for updates. Terry Richmond (Pierre) enters the town of Shelby Springs on a simple but urgent mission \u2014 post bail for his cousin and save him from imminent danger. But when Terry\u2019s life savings are unjustly seized by law enforcement, he\u2019s forced to go head-to-head with local police chief Sandy Burnne (Don Johnson) and his combat-ready officers. Terry finds an unlikely ally in court clerk Summer McBride (AnnaSophia Robb) and the two become ensnared in a deep-rooted conspiracy within the remote township. As the stakes turn deadly, Terry must call upon his\u00a0mysterious background to break the department\u2019s hold on the community, bring justice to his own family \u2013\u2013 and protect Summer in the process. Rebel Ridge is a deeply human yet high-velocity thriller that explores corruption and morality in the context of bone-breaking action and ever-coiling suspense. \u201cI am very interested in examining corrupt systems \u2014 how they are built and what people tell themselves to disavow or justify their own part in them,\u201d Saulnier said. \u201cFor this movie, I wanted to tap into how the rest of us react to said systems, how infuriating they can be \u2014 from corrupt politicians down to the endless loop of a customer service call gone wrong. There\u2019s action and violence for sure, but it was fun to explore weaponizing words in a narrative sense, to make dialogue scenes play like high-stakes set pieces \u2014 to go more terrestrial and more grounded in order to play up an emotional charge that\u00a0can resonate\u00a0even more on-screen with two characters facing off verbally than when the pyrotechnics start exploding.\u201d Aaron Pierre (Old, The Underground Railroad) stars as Terry, alongside an ensemble cast that includes: Saulnier\u2019s enthusiasm for \u201980s and \u201990s action extends beyond film and into TV; he said, \u201cI\u2019m an \u201980s kid, so like many I was first introduced to [Johnson] from Miami Vice. It\u2019s known for the pop culture iconography but that show had weight to it. Gravity. I remember experiencing my first-ever unhappy television ending watching that show \u2014 \u2018The drug dealer got away!\u2019 I\u2019ve been a fan of his since I can remember, and I\u2019ve tracked him for decades. With [the character of] Chief Sandy Burnne, there was an opportunity to let Don have a little bit of fun and chew on some dialogue, but hold close to his ability to come off dead serious, reptilian. We\u2019d get quiet, keep it subtle, almost create live theater along with Aaron to generate that static electricity between them that drives the film forward.\u201d The director cited the \u201craw dynamic\u201d between Pierre and Johnson, and said, \u201cThe whole thrust of the movie is the charge between them, not only the potential for violence, but that restrained idea of sort of gentlemanly respect. Game recognizes game.\u201d Pierre has nothing but wonderful things to say about his castmates. \u201cTo work with AnnaSophia Robb, who is one of my dearest friends now, to work with Don Johnson, to work with James Cromwell and the entirety of the rest of the cast and crew, it was just a blessing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was never one day that my alarm went off where I wasn\u2019t just energized and thrilled to be going to work on this picture with these tremendous artists.\u201d Adds Saulnier about Robb, \u201cIt was clear from her first reading that she had the warmth, the physicality, and a unique understanding of not only her character but the entirety of the screenplay and all of its many layers and mechanisms. The way she simplified all that complexity was a director\u2019s dream.\u201d Rebel Ridge is coming to Netflix on Sept. 6, but you can watch the trailer now, at the top of this page."

        "body": "Read Malcolm Washington\u2019s director\u2019s statement about The Piano Lesson below: The process of adapting an American Classic is a terrifying and sacred undertaking.The early months felt most like an archeological expedition. Co-writer Virgil Williams and I huddled around the table of his desert home, combing through August Wilson\u2019s Pulitzer Prize winning play, some days with a pickaxe, others with the soft bristles of a small brush delicately unearthing precious gems, driven by the pursuit of understanding the intent in each line, each action and each omission. Our first mandate was to honor and uphold the legacy of August Wilson; imbue his spirit into the work. I tried to open myself up to him and learn as much as I could. I read about his close relationship with his mother, that he grew up behind Bella\u2019s Market \u2014 a small storefront that we honor in our film. I traveled to his neighborhood, Pittsburgh\u2019s historic Hill District and walked the streets he grew up on, spoke to his family, all while digging deeper and deeper into his masterwork. I became a student of August Wilson but along the way a curious thing started to happen; the more I learned about August, the more I saw myself in his story and in his work. Boy Willie\u2019s plight felt like much of my own, while I shared Berniece\u2019s sensibilities and understanding of the gravity of legacy. That like Berniece and Boy Willie, part of my purpose is to honor the lives and legacies of my parents and our ancestors. That I too come from a long line of women and men, some born into, then liberated from chattel slavery and that my life is possible because of the decisions, sacrifices and actions of all of them; that it\u2019s paramount for me to do something meaningful with it. That, in the words of Boy Willie, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to build on what they left me.\u201d This was the guiding light for my work on this film, my buoy in the sea. May this work be an offering to the ancestors, a humble act of gratitude and tribute to them, and in honoring them, I honor the spirit of August Wilson and the legacy he left behind for all of us. A legacy that thrives in the power of Danielle Deadwyler\u2019s Berniece, the dynamism of John David Washington\u2019s Boy Willie, and the understated brilliance that is Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s Doaker.Every family has a history, stories from the past that inform the present; an origin story.Ultimately this story is much bigger than me and my family \u2014 it, like the Black American experience, is an interconnected web of stories that span space and time. I hope that when audiences experience our film, they see themselves on the screen and hear the voices of their ancestors calling to them, offering peace and protection.

A new group of singles has entered the experiment that tests whether true love can blossom sight unseen between strangers. If this season\u2019s pod squad is any indication, then love is alive and well in the United Kingdom, as six couples \u2014 Sabrina and Steven, Maria and Tom, Jasmine and Bobby, Demi and Ollie, Catherine and Freddie, and Nicole and Benaiah \u2014 take the plunge and get engaged. And while not every pair said \u201cI do\u201d on the big day, they\u2019ll all be affected by the life-changing journey that brought them to the altar. Now it\u2019s time to catch up on everything that went down at the finale. Who\u2019s still together? Where does everyone stand after the wedding ceremonies? Keep reading for all the latest updates before the pod squad gets back together for the first time at the reunion on Aug. 26. Love blooms almost instantly between Sabrina and Steven, who become the first couple to get engaged in the pods. The two hopeless romantics develop a sweet and laid-back relationship after their very first date. \u201cYour [love] language is so similar to mine,\u201d Steven tells Sabrina as they bond over their approaches to life and shared daily routines, which include meditation and gratitude journaling. Besides Steven\u2019s penchant for wearing budgie smugglers, the two are able to navigate more challenging topics, including Sabrina\u2019s ambivalence toward having children. \u201cI feel like our hearts and our minds are so aligned, and I can see us having this incredible life together,\u201d she says after they compromise about what their future family might look like. They also overcome an early hurdle, as Sabrina hails from Belfast, while Steven calls London home. She readily agrees that they\u2019ll start their lives together in the latter, where she can begin a new chapter personally and professionally. And when they do finally lay eyes on each other, it\u2019s \u201cliterally the best moment\u201d of Steven and Sabrina\u2019s lives. As they jet off to the romantic retreat, their physical connection easily matches their emotional one as the pair cements themselves as one of the strongest and most stable couples of the group. Back in London, Steven and Sabrina build upon their strong foundation, keeping things calm and steady right up to the wedding day, when they both say \u201cI do.\u201d Coming from two very different backgrounds, Maria and Tom bridge their cultural divides thanks to a shared sense of humor. Dating is largely frowned upon in Maria\u2019s religious Moroccan community, but she\u2019s ready to put herself first, especially after losing her \u201crole model\u201d father. Tom, meanwhile, has been on a journey of personal growth since carrying the wounds of his father abandoning him at an early age. Now, both are ready to heal and step into a new future with a soulmate in tow. But in the pods, Tom is torn between his feelings for Maria and Natasha, who he says would easily integrate into his world back home. Ultimately, Tom breaks things off with Natasha as his feelings for and conversations with Maria deepen. \u201cI genuinely feel like I\u2019m most myself with you,\u201d Tom tells Maria. When Maria lets her walls down, the two get engaged. \u201cTom, I have never pictured my life with someone until I met you,\u201d she confesses. \u201cI have never felt like this with anyone. You are absolutely amazing. I have never felt so sure about anyone.\u201d During the reveal, Maria makes an impact with her red dress and lipstick, which unfortunately for Tom isn\u2019t kiss-proof. On the retreat, the couple are a natural fit. However, when they return to London, some cracks begin to show, given Tom\u2019s \u201cjudgmental\u201d attitude toward Maria\u2019s career and her traditional values. Ultimately, the pair\u2019s differences about gender roles prove too much to overcome. On the big day, Maria is ready to get married, but Tom still has reservations about their conflicting values and walks away. From the beginning, earnest Bobby hits it off big time with straight-talking Jasmine \u2014 but Sam also takes a liking to the London-based mental health nurse. As her dates with Sam continue, doubts about his authenticity weigh on Jasmine, who eventually ends their relationship. Free to focus on Bobby, she builds a strong foundation with him, grounded in their close relationships with their mothers and hopes of starting a family one day. When Bobby opens up about the death of his cousin, Jasmine is moved by his vulnerability. \u201cI want to be your safe space to tell me anything that\u2019s on your mind,\u201d she tells him. \u201cYou are an outstanding guy.\u201d Crystal clear on their connection, the two get engaged: Bobby raps his proposal to Jasmine, who immediately accepts. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s been quite apparent from the start that Jasmine was the girl for me,\u201d says Bobby. \u201cThis is the best kind of love I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d Apart from weighing in on other couples\u2019 drama (more on that below), it\u2019s smooth sailing for Jasmine and Bobby on the retreat. But once they return to life back home, Jasmine\u2019s no-nonsense mother puts Bobby in the hot seat, and the couple faces the first major challenge in their fledgling relationship. Protective and forthright, she thinks the pair are rushing into things, and this gives Jasmine a lot to consider ahead of their wedding day. Ultimately, the couple do get her mother\u2019s blessing, and they get married. The last couple to get engaged this season, Demi and Ollie build up slowly to their proposal. Date after date, their feelings quietly deepen as they bond over their London upbringings, shared love of sports, and cheeky senses of humor. \u201cI do genuinely believe that a solid foundation for a relationship is a friendship, and I already feel like I got that with you,\u201d Ollie tells Demi on their first date. And the two aren\u2019t afraid to go deep either, addressing early on their feelings about starting a family. When Demi nervously shares that her endometriosis could make fertility difficult, Ollie meets her with openness and empathy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything about the way I feel about you or how I feel about our future,\u201d he tells her. In the pods, Ollie also pursues a connection with Catherine, with whom he shares a more overtly sexual connection. Ultimately, he chooses to depart from his typical dating habits and propose to Demi. At the big reveal, Ollie says he\u2019s \u201cblown away\u201d by Demi\u2019s beauty \u2014 and she feels the same way. On the retreat, the two begin to explore their physical connection but hit an early snag when other pod squad members begin to weigh in on their dynamic. During a particularly tense conversation with Demi\u2019s closest friend, Jasmine, Ollie storms off after feeling \u201cinterrogated\u201d by the group. Despite the drama, the two head back to London and attempt to blend their lives. At home, the couple thrives while spending time alone and meeting their respective families. Ollie tells Demi about his ADHD diagnosis, and they talk about each other as best friends as well as partners. But on their wedding day, Demi says no to the vows, shocking Ollie. Afterward, they talk positively about the future, so this might not be the end for them. Following in the footsteps of the many great (and messy) love triangles before them, Nicole, Benaiah, and Sam are a massive source of drama this season. Wooed by smooth-talking Sam\u2019s open desire for romance, divorc\u00e9e Nicole is intrigued by his vulnerability but hesitant about his \u201csaying all the right things.\u201d Nicole develops a strong spiritual connection with Benaiah, as the two share a similar worldview, commitment to \u201cconscious living,\u201d and a love for the outdoors. \u201cBenaiah is a very inspirational character. We have a lot in common, and it\u2019s just honestly a breath of fresh air,\u201d she says after their first date. But when Nicole wants reassurance that their courtship will turn into a proposal, Benaiah misses his moment. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m pulling teeth when there\u2019s a conversation about the future,\u201d Nicole says. \u201cWith Sam, he\u2019s really committed to us.\u201d Despite warnings about Sam from Benaiah and others, Nicole ends things with Benaiah and accepts Sam\u2019s proposal. But once Nicole and Sam see each other for the first time, something feels off \u2014 and not just because Sam puts the ring on the wrong finger. Realizing she made a massive mistake, Nicole breaks things off with Sam and reconnects with Benaiah once she returns to the UK. \u201cI made a decision that wasn\u2019t quite right,\u201d Nicole tells Benaiah. \u201cYou were so right, and I didn\u2019t want to hear it. I am sorry.\u201d He accepts her apology, and they get engaged before joining the rest of the couples on the retreat. Back in London, a brush with Sam at group drinks brings out Benaiah\u2019s jealousy, as the former claims Nicole wanted to get physical but Sam rejected\u00a0her. But nothing can deter the couple from committing to each other after overcoming hardships, and they ultimately choose each other and decide to get married. Immediate comfort, plenty of laughs, and a string of bizarre coincidences form the foundation of Catherine and Freddie\u2019s relationship. From their very first date, the pair connect over their twice-a-day workouts, deep love of family, and some other mind-blowing similarities. \u201cMy middle name\u2019s Mary \u2026 after my gran,\u201d Catherine says in Episode 1, to which a shocked Freddie replies, \u201cMy nana was called Mary!\u201d While Catherine also develops a strong attraction to Ollie in the pods, she chooses to get engaged to Freddie because he makes her \u201cfeel like family.\u201d When the two meet in person, a physical connection develops instantly, and they share their first kiss through tears of happiness. During the retreat, Catherine claims she was the one who ended things with Ollie, while he remembers it differently. Once all the couples reunite, the pod exes clear the air about the circumstances of their splits, creating \u201cweird tension\u201d with Ollie\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Demi. But in the end, another ex in Freddie\u2019s past causes the most drama for Catherine, as he admits to cheating in a previous relationship. The reveal shakes the couple to their core, destabilizing their once rock-solid connection before they head back home and meet each other\u2019s families. When Freddie suggests a prenup, the tension ramps up. On their wedding day, Freddie\u2019s sister doubts the couple is on the same page. Catherine says \u201cI do,\u201d but Freddie walks away. He tries to smooth things over, but it\u2019s unclear if Catherine will get over this rejection."
