The demand is clearly there: users of its ChatGPT Enterprise offering grew 4x in a matter of months, from 150,000 in January 2024 to 600,000 in April 2024.\u00a0\nIts 3 acquisitions so far \u2014\u00a0Multi, Rockset, and Global Illumination \u2014 arm it with key capabilities and talent to target that segment. For instance:\n\nMulti developed a video platform for remote team collaboration across shared screens, and its small team is reportedly joining OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT desktop unit. Enhancing ChatGPT for desktops is an opportunity for OpenAI to embed itself deeper in enterprise workflows like software engineering.\nRockset has developed an approach to speed up data retrieval and processing for AI systems \u2014 potentially a key enabler for OpenAI\u2019s enterprise capabilities, particularly in industries where access to real-time data (like financial analysis and cybersecurity) is essential. Notably, Rockset was previously backed by Sequoia Capital \u2014 also an investor in OpenAI.\n\nBroadly, OpenAI\u2019s 3 acquisitions share a few common traits: they focus on small teams with strong talent, they\u2019re relatively early in their commercial trajectory, and they develop enterprise AI tools or infrastructure.\nUsing this criteria and CB Insights data, we built a shortlist of 60+ potential OpenAI M&A targets, with a focus on emerging AI players with strong management teams, that the company could go after next to sharpen its B2B focus.\nWant to see more research?

However, while funding gained momentum, deals slid for the ninth quarter in a row to 6,230. Global deal volume is now less than half of what it was at its peak in Q1\u201922.\nAt $14.4M, the average deal size is up 17% this year so far vs. 2023. Even in a more cautious investing environment, the deals that do happen have ballooned in size as investors put more behind select startups.\u00a0\nAI startups are dominating global funding, capturing 35% in Q2\u201924. This is the highest quarterly share on record. AI startups drew $23.2B in Q2\u201924 \u2014 up 59% QoQ \u2014 driven by mammoth $1B+ deals to Elon Musk\u2019s xAI as well as Scale, CoreWeave, and others.\u00a0\nThe US is attracting a greater portion of exit activity, with exit share rising 4 percentage points QoQ to 39%. This represents its highest share in 2 years. Top US-based exits in Q2\u201924 included IPOs from Tempus and Rubrik \u2014\u00a0both valued at over $5B \u2014\u00a0as well as Hyundai\u2019s acquisition of Motional priced at $4.1B.\nSOSV is the most active venture investor, backing 35 companies in Q2\u201924. It\u2019s followed by Andreessen Horowitz (33 companies), General Catalyst (31 companies), and Lightspeed Venture Partners (28).\nFintech funding rebounds 19% QoQ to hit $8.9B \u2014\u00a0a 5-quarter high\u00a0\u2014 led by $600M+ rounds to Stripe and AlphaSense. But it was a different story for the retail tech and digital health sectors: retail tech funding was stagnant from Q1 to Q2, while digital health funding slipped by 26%.\nQuarterly funding to startups in Asia falls below $10B for the first time since 2014. The drop was especially severe in China, where some international investors have pulled back or retreated altogether amid rising geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, the US and Europe \u2014 the two largest regions for venture investment \u2014 each saw funding grow by double-digit percentages in Q2\u201924.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE STATE OF VENTURE Q2\u201924 REPORT\nGet 205+ pages of charts and data detailing the latest trends in venture capital.\nFirst nameLast nameEmailCompany NameJob TitlePhone number\n\nVenture funding ticked up for a second consecutive quarter, reaching $65.7B in Q2\u201924. Nearly half of this funding (47%) came from mega-rounds (deals worth $100M+). xAI\u2019s $6B round alone represented nearly one-tenth of the global total and helped prevent funding from declining QoQ.\nDespite the strong showing, deal volume slipped for a ninth straight quarter \u2014 sinking 7% to 6,230 \u2014 as investors remain cautious in the less exuberant market. The US, Europe, and Asia all saw deal count decrease QoQ, while it grew slightly across Canada, LatAm, Africa, and Oceania.\n\n\nWith deals down and funding up, the average deal size has climbed this year, pacing at $14.4M \u2014\u00a0up 17% compared to full-year 2023. Notably, it\u2019s not just a few massive deals that are pulling that figure up: the median deal size has also grown from $2.5M to $3M over the same period.\u00a0\nAmong investment stages, the median deal size has increased across early- and mid-stage rounds, while it has fallen slightly at the late stage.\n\n\nOne factor more than any other is driving gains in the venture market right now, and that\u2019s AI. Startups developing AI solutions raised $23.2B in Q2\u201924 \u2014 accounting for 35% of the global total, the highest share ever recorded. This share has been trending up for several years now, especially since the arrival of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in late 2022.\nLeading the pack among AI startups, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI outfit raised a whopping $6B round in Q2\u201924. The 1-year-old company, now valued at $24B, had no trouble finding investors, who believe xAI will gain a competitive edge through integration with Musk\u2019s network of companies (and their data). For instance, Tesla could use xAI\u2019s latest multimodal AI model, which includes vision capabilities, to bring more advanced perception to its Optimus humanoid.\n\nThe Funding Insights from xAI\u2019s CB Insights profile point to synergies between xAI and Musk\u2019s other companies, like Tesla.\nOther top AI rounds in Q2\u201924 went to:\n\nG42 \u2014\u00a0$1.5B investment from Microsoft\nCoreWeave \u2014 $1.1B Series C at a $19B valuation\nWayve \u2014\u00a0$1.05B Series C from SoftBank, Nvidia, and Microsoft\nScale \u2014\u00a0$1B Series F led by Accel, with backing from corporates including AMD, Amazon, Intel, and Nvidia\n\nCustomers can explore thousands of AI startups across industries and technologies in the CB Insights AI Expert Collection.\nDOWNLOAD THE STATE OF VENTURE Q2\u201924 REPORT\nGet 205+ pages of charts and data detailing the latest trends in venture capital.\nFirst nameLast nameEmailCompany NameJob TitlePhone number\n\n\nIn Q2\u201924, the US saw 39% of all exits, which included both IPOs and M&A transactions. The figure represents an increase of 4 percentage points QoQ and puts the US in the No. 1 spot globally, tied with Europe.\nNotably, US IPOs are gaining some strength, with Q2 seeing blockbuster debuts from Tempus (valued at $6.1B) and Rubrik ($5.6B). We predicted both companies would go public in our Tech IPO Pipeline report, published in late 2023.\u00a0\nGo deeper with CB Insights buyer interviews for Tempus and Rubrik to see what their customers are saying.\nMeanwhile, the US venture market\u2019s top M&A deal went to Motional, an autonomous driving startup founded as a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv. Hyundai took a majority stake in the company at a $4.1B valuation. Per the Funding Insights on Motional\u2019s CB Insights profile, Hyundai and Motional are co-developing a robotaxi service with a target release of 2024.\n\nThe Acquisition Insights from Hyundai\u2019s CB Insights profile break down the structure and goals of the Motional deal.\n\n\nAround the world, the most active venture investor right now is SOSV. The firm, which primarily backs early-stage startups, invested in 35 unique companies in Q2\u201924, placing it ahead of a16z (33 companies), General Catalyst (31), and Lightspeed (28).\u00a0\nCustomers can use this CB Insights platform search to see SOSV\u2019s top portfolio companies ranked by Mosaic score \u2014 which measures a private company\u2019s health \u2014 alongside data cuts like commercial maturity, headcount growth, and more.\n\n\nAmong industry sectors, fintech saw funding grow the most, watching it rise 19% QoQ to reach $8.9B. This marks a rebound for the sector vs. Q1\u201924. Top fintech deals in the quarter went to payments leader Stripe and market intelligence firm AlphaSense.\u00a0\nThe retail tech and digital health sectors were worse off than fintech. Retail tech funding was roughly stagnant QoQ, while digital health funding plummeted to below $3B \u2014\u00a0its second-lowest quarterly level since 2016.\n\n\nAmong major global regions, the US and Europe outpaced the market as a whole for funding growth in Q2\u201924.\u00a0\nAsia, on the other hand, saw its funding fall 13% QoQ to $9.7B. The decline was most pronounced in China, where dollars tumbled more than 50% to $2.2B, whereas India, Singapore, and Japan all experienced funding growth QoQ.\u00a0\nThe top two equity deals in the region went to United Arab Emirates\u2019 G42 and India-based Zepto.\nIf you aren\u2019t already a client, sign\n\t\t\t\t\tup for a free trial to learn more about our platform.\n"
