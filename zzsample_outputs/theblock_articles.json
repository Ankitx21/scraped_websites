        "body": "Bitcoin  BTC \n      +2.39%\n      surged past $61,000 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed increased confidence that U.S. inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2% and indicated that the central bank may start lowering interest rates. \"The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" Powell said at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday. Following the speech at the central bankers' conference in Wyoming, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $2.28 trillion, reflecting a 0.6% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. Stocks rose on Friday after Powell's dovish tones. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 417 points, or 1%. The S&P 500 gained 1.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.8%, with technology stocks leading the way in early trading in New York. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there is now a 67.5% probability of a 25 basis point cut and a 32.5% chance of a 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate at next month's meeting. Bitfinex Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner told The Block that today's speech at Jackson Hole was a significant indicator of what to expect at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on September 18. \"Today's speech will likely set the tone for September, with investors paying close attention to Powell's interpretation of recent data and any hints about the scale and timing of future cuts,\" Kooner told The Block. \"The broader economic indicators, such as GDP and jobless claims, suggest the economy is not in the same dire state as during the 2009 recession,\" he added."

The data also show a notable 11% drop in bitcoin supply on centralized exchanges since the start of the year.

Fewer coins on exchanges generally weaken supply-side pressures and support the potential for price appreciation. Bitcoin exchange reserves are now at a multi-year low. Image: CryptoQuant. SynFutures co-founder Rachel Lin outlined derivatives market indicators that suggest traders are positioning for bullish bitcoin price movements. \"On the derivatives front, market sentiment remains bullish. For bitcoin, the highest open interest is on the $100,000 December expiry call option,\" Lin told The Block. Deribit metrics for all upcoming expiries show the largest concentration of options being calls at $100,000 and $105,000. The data also shows the top options contract by trading volume in the past 24 hours is for end-of-month expiry calls at a strike price of $75,000. Lin also added that Ethereum  ETH \n      +3.31%\n     's derivatives market is similarly optimistic, with the highest open interest being the $4,000 strike price September expiry call option, followed by the $6,000 strike price December call.

        "body": "China has extradited a suspect surnamed Zhang from Thailand. Zhang allegedly led a massive $14 billion pyramid scheme involving cryptocurrency, making Zhang the first financial criminal suspect to be extradited through the China-Thailand extradition treaty since it took effect in 1999. China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security announced today that Chinese and Thai authorities have formed a special working group called \u201cHunting Fox\u201d and extradited Zhang to China on Wednesday. Starting in 2012, Zhang allegedly led a scheme known as \u201cMBI Group,\u201d which lured investors into paying fees ranging from 700 yuan ($98) to 245,000 yuan ($34,300) to obtain membership through the issuance of cryptocurrency. The authorities said the group lured over 10 million members with promises of high returns, with the funds involved exceeding 100 billion yuan ($14 billion). According to the police's announcement, the police in Chongqing, a first-tier city in Southwestern China, initiated an investigation into Zhang in November 2020. In March 2021, Interpol\u2019s Chinese branch issued a red notice for Zhang. Then, in July 2022, the police in Thailand arrested him, and a court in Thailand issued a ruling to extradite Zhang to China in May this year. China banned crypto trading activities on the mainland in 2021, but many investors still tried to circumvent the rules. In May, Chinese police busted an underground bank that used the USDT stablecoin for foreign currency exchanges, involving transactions worth at least 13.8 billion yuan ($1.9 billion). Earlier this week, China\u2019s top legal authorities included using cryptocurrencies to transfer illicit funds as a money laundering method in a judicial interpretation \u2014 making it easier to investigate and prosecute crypto-linked money laundering cases."

        "body": "JPMorgan has downgraded price targets for bitcoin miners to reflect second-quarter results and other company-specific announcements, such as fleet efficiency improvements and hashrate targets. The decline in price targets is primarily due to a drop in bitcoin prices since the last model update, reducing the spot bitcoin price assumption from $68,000 to $60,000, according to an analyst report from the investment bank released Friday. Additionally, the baseline network hashrate assumption has increased from 600 exahash per second to 615 EH/s. These factors have led to a reduction in the target gross profit per EH/s estimates for the miners, the report added. \"Our price targets generally declined due to share count dilution, lower bitcoin prices and a rising network hashrate. We remain overweight IREN, our top pick, and RIOT, underweight MARA, and are neutral CIFR and CLSK,\" JP Morgan analysts Reginald L. Smith and Charles Pearce said, referring to publicly-traded bitcoin miners Iris Energy, Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, Cipher Mining and CleanSpark, respectively. However, the investment bank\u2019s analysis suggests the potential for improved sentiment and share gains for both RIOT and IREN in the coming months. Friday's report highlighted better uptime and production metrics for RIOT, following the installation of immersion-cooled miners at its Corsicana facility. The report also notes that the recent decline in IREN shares over the past three weeks, attributed to a sharp rise in power costs in July related to power hedging losses, presents a potential opportunity. \"We think these missteps are correctable, and view recent weakness as a nice buying opportunity. Headlines like these also make us appreciate the consistently solid operations at CleanSpark and Cipher, which have delivered industry leading uptime and expense management for several quarters,\" the report said."

This is part of its strategic endgame plan, which is expected to launch soon. MakerDAO noted that the redenomination aims to enable broader participation in the platform's governance by allowing more users to hold significant amounts of the new governance token, NGT, thereby democratizing the decision-making process. Alongside the introduction of NGT, MakerDAO will be rolling out a new stablecoin, NewStable (NST), pegged 1:1 with Dai. The existing Dai and MKR tokens will remain active, allowing users to choose between the original tokens and their new counterparts. \"Both tokens are expected to stay unchanged for the foreseeable future unless governance decides otherwise,\" MakerDAO noted. The proposal emphasizes user choice, stating that upgrading to NewStable and NewGovToken is optional. Users who transition to the new tokens can revert to the original Dai and MKR, ensuring that the MakerDAO ecosystem remains flexible. MakerDAO added that its ecosystem would \"eventually explore ways to differentiate Dai and NewStable.\" According to the DAO, Dai may continue its focus on crypto-native use cases in this setup, and NewStable may target mass adoption.  Dai is the largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by a decentralized entity. It is also the third-largest stablecoin overall, following Tether USD and Circle\u2019s USDC, with a market capitalization of $5.2 billion.  The project is governed by the Maker token, which has an approximate supply of 1 million tokens and a market cap of over $2 billion.\u00a0According to The Block's price page, the token has been up 5% over the past 24 hours and currently trades at $2130."

The Block reached out to Worldcoin for comment. Such collection of human iris data has been scrutinized by regulatory agencies in multiple jurisdictions worldwide. While Worldcoin enabled users to have control over their iris data in March, Hong Kong proceeded to ban its operations in the region."
