Welcome to the On the Margin Newsletter, brought to you by Ben Strack and Casey Wagner. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll find in today\u2019s edition: We wrote last week about the seeming health of various bitcoin miners \u2014 taking into account their Q2 results and what they have in the pipeline. But today marks exactly four months since the last Bitcoin halving, giving us another chance to evaluate the companies in a bit of a different light.\u00a0 The big question in April was which mining companies would survive \u2014 and thrive \u2014 after an event that slashed per-block mining rewards. Industry watchers had guessed at least some ailing mining stocks would show post-halving strength, spurring share price rebounds. So which ones have been good buys so far?\u00a0 The public bitcoin miner with the biggest stock price gain \u2014 from April 19\u2019s market close to Aug. 19\u2019s open \u2014 is Core Scientific, at 229%, Yahoo Finance data shows. Core Scientific expanded its deal with CoreWeave earlier this month to offer an additional 112 megawatts of high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure (supporting the burgeoning AI category).\u00a0 \u201cIt became clear back in Q1 that those bitcoin miners who bridged the gap needed for AI infrastructure would outperform those who were solely focused on securing the Bitcoin network,\u201d said Dan Weiskopf, co-portfolio manager of the crypto-focused Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK).\u00a0 Also seeing significant share price boosts from four months ago are TeraWulf and Iris Energy, at 79% and 63%, respectively. An honorary mention goes to Hut 8 Mining, which has enjoyed a 44% gain.\u00a0\u00a0 Others in the green \u2014 albeit to a lesser degree \u2014 are Bitfarms (23%), Hive Digital Technologies (12%) and Bitdeer (9%).\u00a0\u00a0 Newsletter Subscribe to On The Margin Newsletter  Those with essentially flat share prices since April 19 are mining giants Marathon Digital and New York-based Cipher Mining. Two big public miners that have endured share price declines since the halving have been CleanSpark and Riot Platforms, which have lost 31% and 12%, respectively. Some mining companies have indeed looked to combat declining mining profits by building out their HPC businesses to support AI applications, noted BIT Mining chief economist Youwei Yang.\u00a0 \u201cMost of the crypto miners [that] chose to transform into AI are still in the pilot phase,\u201d he said. \u201cSome are more successful than others\u2026but this is definitely an area to look out for potential prosperity.\u201d While Weiskopf said he is excited about \u201cthe AI side of the portfolio,\u201d not every miner can, or wants, to build out that type of capability. \u201cThose companies that are pursuing the HPC-AI opportunity are building a more steady business,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cBut if bitcoin explodes to the upside, they may prove to be less correlated to that price action \u2014 especially since some of the pure-play miners have leveraged up by adding to their bitcoin treasury.\u201d CLSK and RIOT offer a more \u201csingular focus\u201d \u2014 fitting into the portfolio as \u201chigher beta plays on the price action of bitcoin.\u201d Not to mention Marathon, which now owns more than 25,000 BTC after two big buys of the asset in recent weeks. While CORZ is the biggest holding in the ETF that Weiskopf co-manages (at about 5.7%), the fund has 2%-plus allocations in Hut 8, CleanSpark, Bitfarms and Marathon.\u00a0 Different miners have different edges, and the post-halving leaderboard is likely to evolve as does the crypto market. Stay tuned.\u00a0 \u2014 Ben Strack\u00a0 The approximate assets under management for crypto fund manager Bitwise following its acquisition of London-based ETC Group. The buy gives the San Francisco firm a broader global footprint, as it will take over ETC Group\u2019s nine European-listed crypto ETPs. Bitwise\u2019s largest fund is its Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which has grown to roughly $2.3 billion since launching in January. The firm launched a spot ether ETF last month, and its newly acquired offerings include ones focused on other crypto assets such as solana and XRP.\u00a0\u00a0 The Democratic National Convention kicked off today in Chicago.\u00a0 Kamala Harris and running mate Tim Walz are not scheduled to take the stage until later this week, likely after delegates officially nominate them as the party\u2019s pick to take on Donald Trump in November.\u00a0 Democrats released their party platform Sunday evening, which was written before President Joe Biden bowed out of the race last month. It\u2019s pretty obvious the authors penned it before Harris stepped in, given they refer to Biden\u2019s \u201csecond term\u201d almost 20 times.\u00a0 Still, it\u2019s expected Harris will adopt many of the same values laid out by party leadership. The platform makes no mention of digital assets, blockchain or crypto, which some say is actually a sign Democrats are viewing the industry more favorably.\u00a0 Dems aren\u2019t calling for more power to the SEC, for banks to block crypto customers, or even for increased crackdowns on scams, Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran said on X Monday. While Sen. Elizabeth Warren actively called for \u201canti-crypto\u201d policy, current party leadership appears to be punting the issue, at least for now.\u00a0 I\u2019d have to agree that no mention of crypto seems to signal the party is not feeling hostile toward the industry. But I do wonder how long this silence will last, especially if Harris makes it to the White House.\u00a0 Historically, candidates tend to do better in the polls post-convention, so expect a Harris/Walz spike after Thursday. Another big political event for investors to keep an eye on will be the first presidential debate between Trump and Harris, scheduled for Sept. 10.\u00a0 \u2014 Casey Wagner We hope you had a good weekend! After last week\u2019s mixed data, markets will be looking for reassurance that interest rate cuts are coming in September and economic growth is not slowing too much.

Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  Diogo M\u00f3nica, who just joined Haun earlier this year, spoke to Blockworks about his first deal with the VC firm and why he was putting money where his mouth is when it comes to Chaos.\u00a0 Plus, he explained, it doesn\u2019t hurt to find a \u201cdeal that I fell in love with. It\u2019s totally up my alley. It was quite lucky.\u201d With his background as a security engineer, the co-founder of Anchorage said he\u2019s been focused on the backend throughout his career.\u00a0 \u201cSo it\u2019s this core, fundamental portion of on-chain finance that we don\u2019t talk about much, but is actually what\u2019s building like the the ability of these protocols to survive and risk management is extremely important, regardless of the fact that users should never see it. Users should never be thinking about security. They should just use a product and the product works,\u201d M\u00f3nica said.\u00a0 Per a press release, the team at Chaos Labs hopes to \u201cempower decentralized applications with contextualized data to increase capital efficiency and achieve performance parity with their centralized counterparts.\u201d \u201cSo\u2026one of the cool risk innovations is these risk oracles that they\u2019re coming to market with that allow these protocols just behave better when in terms of risk,\u201d M\u00f3nica said.\u00a0 Chaos Labs is currently utilized by 20 protocols including Jupiter and Aave.

Howdy!\u00a0 We\u2019re trying something a little different today and diving into the world of Solana-centric content creation.\u00a0 I had a fun time getting the inside scoop from bangerz, whose videos I\u2019ve cringed at from afar for some time now: The Solana Saga was in-demand in January 2024 as speculators sought to cash in on airdropped tokens that came with the device. Bangerz, a pseudonymous X creator who works at a Solana NFT startup, decided to fake a video of herself microwaving her Saga phone.\u00a0 Her black hair gel and screen protector fake was convincing enough: it drew hundreds of likes and replies and fooled some in crypto media. She then created a \u201cMicrowave\u201d NFT collection on her platform 3.land that saw thousands of mints and some secondary trading. Bangerz followed this up with another viral video explaining the microwaved Saga was a fake. In the months since, bangerz has continued making Solana-centric content, but rather than continuing to melt phones, she\u2019s settled on a different growth strategy: super cringe-worthy videos. It seems to be working out so far. \u201cShe\u2019s a creative mastermind that understands the crypto audience perfectly,\u201d DRiP founder and CEO Vibhu Norby told me in a text. \u201cWhat\u2019s more shareable than content so horrifically bad that you can\u2019t look away?\u201d\u00a0 Bangerz is a creator on DRiP. One of bangerz\u2019 most popular videos, a \u201cBarbie Girl\u201d parody where she sings painfully off-key as a \u201ccrypto girl,\u201d illustrates how cringe can be a winning social strategy. The replies under the X post are a bloodbath. \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined my day and in ways I didn\u2019t think possible,\u201d one user wrote. Newsletter Subscribe to Lightspeed Newsletter  And yet the video garnered over 500,000 views. \u201cA lot of my content goes viral because it\u2019s very divisive,\u201d bangerz told me in an interview, adding later: \u201cBad content doesn\u2019t get seen.\u201d Bangerz\u2019 attention play is a response to a real problem for Solana creators. On the pump.fun memecoin launchpad, only about 1% of new tokens draw significant investment and \u201cgraduate\u201d to the Raydium DEX within 24 hours, according to a Dune dashboard. It\u2019s now free to launch tokens on pump.fun, meaning a huge number of memes are now competing for Solana\u2019s limited attention. The trenches are cooked, as the young people might say.\u00a0 Before bangerz was a Solana content creator, she worked in other startups, even getting a patent for one product \u2014 a cooler using an endothermic chemical reaction to store vaccines in places without electricity.\u00a0 She was drawn to being an influencer though, and she grew a successful art account on Instagram. She said she became addicted to the \u201cgame\u201d of iterating around content that was successful \u2014 in that case, art involving aliens, weed, and sex. Now having moved into Web3, she\u2019s once again iterating around what works, which for the past couple months appears to have been musical rage bait.\u00a0 \u201cHate is the funnel\u201d that brings in a lot of bangerz\u2019 followers, she told me. This isn\u2019t always a fun strategy: some people do say \u201cterrible things\u201d to her, and it\u2019s not a persona she could pull off without \u201cthick skin.\u201d The \u201cmeta\u201d of bangerz\u2019 strategy is that once repeat viewers come to understand that her videos are akin to rage bait, they get in on a kind of collective inside joke, she told me. This \u201cI know that you know\u201d effect creates an audience that actively encourages the cringe. \u201cUnfollowed for not being cringe and actually being good,\u201d one user sarcastically wrote under an AI-generated bangerz country song called \u201cDegen Boo.\u201d This all feels like a strategy that\u2019s tailor-made for Web3, which is filled with copypasta and engagement bait and can at times feel like a large insular inside joke. There are many ways to skin a cat, and for now, putting out nearly unwatchable videos has become bangerz\u2019 strategy for growing 3.land. \u201cWith a startup, distribution is everything,\u201d bangerz said. \u201cBuilding the product doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s \u2018how do you get people to use it?\u2019\u201d I asked bangerz if she finds it hard to watch her own videos. \u201cOh, yeah. Oh yeah oh yeah,\u201d she said, recalling scripting and filming a cosplay video where she dressed up as Pepe the frog.\u00a0 \u201cHorrible. Like I\u2019m sick thinking about that. Hated it,\u201d she said. \u201cThank God it didn\u2019t go viral.\u201d \u2014 Jack Kubinec Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko\u2019s monthly followers gained on X tracks surprisingly well with Solana\u2019s price.\u00a0 There\u2019s a clear cycle in crypto where higher asset prices lead to more media coverage and interest from the general public. Yakovenko\u2019s X account grew most September 2021 and March 2024, months which coincided with SOL\u2019s price nearing all-time highs. Creators like bangerz can hope this process works in reverse, too: more social media followers could bring more eyeballs to a project, which could possibly lead to more investment. \u2014 Jack Kubinec ICYMI this week aboard the good ship Solana: \u2014 Jeffrey Albus A message from Vibhu Norby, founder and CEO of DRiP: Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Howdy!\u00a0 It seems like anyone who\u2019s anyone in New York had their flight home canceled last night \u2014 including myself, who is writing this newsletter from North Carolina after being rugged by Spirit Airlines. This country really needs to build more trains. Anyway: Last week, the Ethereum DeFi project MakerDAO cut off lending and borrowing of wBTC \u2014 a \u201cwrapped\u201d bitcoin asset issued by the crypto exchange BitGo.\u00a0 Maker did so because BitGo said it would begin sharing custody of wBTC with BiT Global as part of a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem. The move partly showed how polarizing Sun has become: His name is mentioned six times in the first two paragraphs of the proposal to offboard wBTC. BitGo raced to quell fears surrounding Sun\u2019s involvement, reversing course on having BiT Global control two of the three keys needed to control wBTC. Coinbase seized on the snafu to advertise its own wrapped bitcoin product. For an overview of where the situation stands, I recommend this excellent piece by my colleagues Macauley Peterson and Donavan Choy. The idea behind wrapped bitcoin is pretty simple: Ethereum users, for instance, might want to use bitcoin for things like DeFi collateral, but Bitcoin and Ethereum are different blockchains with different token standards. To solve this, wrapped bitcoin issuers buy bitcoin, stash it away, and offer tokens that track the price of bitcoin but in the wrapping of an ERC-20, which is Ethereum\u2019s token standard.\u00a0 The security of this all depends on you trusting the custodian not to do nefarious things with the bitcoin, so BitGo\u2019s Justin Sun partnership being questioned is a big deal for wBTC \u2014 and anyone hoping to claw away some of its market share. Newsletter Subscribe to Lightspeed Newsletter  Interestingly, the Solana DEX aggregator Jupiter\u2019s anonymous co-founder meow was part of the founding team behind wBTC. They also helped make wBTC the largest wrapped bitcoin product on Solana: The Jupiter Liquidity Provider pool holds about $70 million in wBTC out of around $106 million that\u2019s been brought to Solana using the Wormhole bridge. Soon after the wBTC controversy spilled into public view, meow got on an X space with Sun and BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, where it was brought up that BiT Global could have a second \u201cbackup\u201d key that some feared would let it gain access to wBTC\u2019s 2/3 multisig wallet by itself. Jupiter \u201cwould have exited [immediately]\u201d from its wBTC exposure if this policy remained in place following the X space, meow told me in a text. BitGo changed its model to leave Sun-affiliated BiT Global with just one key, but Jupiter will still \u201clikely\u201d be looking to diversify its wrapped bitcoin exposure, meow told me, noting that alternatives won\u2019t necessarily be more secure.\u00a0 Bitcoin is a big deal everywhere in crypto, though wrapped bitcoin is still bigger business on Ethereum than on Solana. There is roughly 154,000 wBTC on Ethereum, according to a Dune dashboard, compared to around 1,800 wBTC bridged to Solana via Wormhole, per Solscan. Other wrapped bitcoin alternatives are available on Solana, like tBTC and 21BTC, but neither has a significant market cap \u2014 there are around 75 tBTC and 11 21BTC on Solana. With wrapped bitcoin facing scrutiny, now could be the time to strike for would-be wBTC competitors. I\u2019d personally expect to see some movement happen here in the coming weeks. \u201c[It] seems like a good opportunity for wBTC alternatives, especially Solana focused solutions, to carve [out] some space from wBTC\u2019s current moat,\u201d Infra, the anonymous labs lead at Raydium told me in a text. \u2014 Jack Kubinec It wasn\u2019t a great week for SOL flows: CoinShares data showed that around $39 million flowed out of Solana last week, which the asset manager said is SOL\u2019s largest week of outflows on record. In a writeup, CoinShares chalked up the outflows to reduced memecoin trading volume.\u00a0 One Dune dashboard indicates Solana DEX volume was at its lowest point since February last week. SOL itself has been roughly flat on the week, trading at around $144 at press time. \u2014 Jack Kubinec Google\u2019s vetting process for apps on its Play Store is facing scrutiny after a Florida woman named Maria Vaca claimed she lost $5 million to a scam crypto app. According to Vaca\u2019s lawsuit, it took Google three months to remove the app despite being notified by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The app, masquerading as a legitimate crypto wallet, allegedly allowed cybercriminals to steal funds from unsuspecting users. Although the app wasn\u2019t named in the lawsuit, some are speculating that it could have been a clone of Solana\u2019s popular Phantom wallet. The frustration with Google\u2019s oversight was palpable, with @neoworldlife stating, \u201cIt\u2019s about time Google adopted Apple Store level checks and compliance.\u201d @d3fenders commented, \u201cIn a decentralized world, you are ultimately responsible for the care that you take of your crypto. It\u2019s a shame that Google is getting fined for typical web3 thievery.\u201d Meanwhile, @SolanaJax advised, \u201cGet a cold wallet please \u2013 avoids a lot of these issues.\u201d Others questioned the severity of the issue, with @tribes_two speculating, \u201cI bet it was user error,\u201d while @ABCat07340480 went so far as to suggest that this case could lead to a broader crackdown, wondering, \u201cAnd this can lead to a crypto wallet ban on the Play Store if this woman has her way and is lying for free money.\u201d Skepticism about Vaca\u2019s chances in court was evident, with @chefderek.eth acknowledging, \u201cAll of us crypto people know she ain\u2019t gonna win.\u201d Others took a similarly harsh view of the situation, like @branditmanaged who asked, \u201cWho the hell keeps even $50,000 let alone 5m in crypto on a hot wallet let alone a phone hot wallet?!?\u201d @Plagueliche added a bit of dark humor, \u201cI need to sue more people for my stupidity.\u201d However, the incident has also sparked deeper concerns about Google\u2019s accountability. As @7Pirelli pointed out, \u201cThey don\u2019t care about $5 million. Punish them with $50 or $500 million, then something will maybe change.\u201d And @Coachkcrypto added, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that there was a scam app on the play store for MONTHS. It took Google 3 months to remove an app that stole over $5m worth of crypto\u2026 isn\u2019t three months a little bit long?\u201d \u2014 Jeffrey Albus A message from Tom Wan, strategy and business development at 21.co: Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "body": "BitGo is preparing to expand management of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), worth $9.2 billion, to two new entities in Hong Kong and Singapore within two months. The company announced last Saturday that it plans to change the legal custody over its WBTC product into a \u201cmulti-jurisdictional and multi-institutional\u201d joint venture with BiT Global as part of a strategic partnership with Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem. Sun\u2019s involvement in the new enterprise provoked a reaction from MakerDAO, which immediately launched a governance discussion on Monday aimed at removing WBTC collateralization from its DAI stablecoin. About 3% ($155 million) of DAI\u2019s collateral backing is made up of WBTC, according to Makerburn. The resulting executive vote passed and was executed Thursday. \u201cWe can infer that Justin Sun will have significant influence or control over the joint venture managing WBTC,\u201d Block Analitica, a Maker risk management team, wrote. In an X space hosted Tuesday, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe stressed that the underlying multi-signature and cold storage technology of WBTC will remain the same. \u201cThe technology that\u2019s being used is the exact same technology that\u2019s used today on a go-forward basis,\u201d Belshe stated. BitGo currently holds 154,266 bitcoins in custody. The BitGo Trust Company uses a 2-of-3 multi-signature security model. All three private keys are held by BitGo in the US today, and the minting or burning of WBTC requires at least two signees. That may not sound like a lot, but Belshe pointed to processes in place to make each one secure.\u00a0 \u201cSo even though you only have three keys that I\u2019ve listed here, the protections on each of those keys still make it so that no single person can access even one of those keys,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Under the planned changes, one private key will be shifted to BiT Global\u2019s ownership. BiT Global is a regulated Trust and Company Service Provider (TCSP) registered in Hong Kong. The remaining two keys will be retained by BitGo, one of which will remain in the US while the other will be held under BitGo Singapore Ltd. Belshe argued that this should enhance confidence in the bitcoin backing of WBTC because two parties will verify BTC deposits received prior to co-signing on a WBTC mint transaction on Ethereum. It\u2019s also an attempt to decentralize the freezing rights of WBTC across jurisdictions which would insulate the asset from a regulatory crackdown risk, he said. The X space was moderated by the Jupiter co-founder known as Meow, part of the founding team for WBTC, who has praised BitGo\u2019s transparency in the past. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  Meow questioned the premise that the change would improve decentralization. At issue was the suggestion that BiT Global would hold a second \u201cbackup\u201d key, that could enable it to meet the two-thirds threshold on its own. In that case, Hong Kong authorities could theoretically control both keys held with BiT Global. Belshe responded by suggesting that regulators would need to cooperate and no one jurisdiction would be likely to take unilateral action. \u201cThere\u2019s no freaking way that one regulator is just going to kowtow to the other one without a lot of conversation,\u201d he said. All of the merchants who issue mint/burn requests to BitGo already operate outside the United States, Belshe said. BitGo reiterated in a follow-up X post that it intends to split up the keys to avoid have two held by BiT Global. \u201cTo address those concerns, the 3rd key will not be held with BiT Global; and will instead be stored in BitGo Singapore Ltd.\u201d the firm wrote. Blockworks contacted BitGo to clarify how new multisig signing keys would be generated to ensure independence and security among multiple parties, but did not hear back by time of publication. Belshe noted that the new arrangements were a work in progress. \u201cI think the key that we want is to make sure that we\u2019re constantly progressing towards more decentralization, less concentration of power,\u201d Belshe said. Read more: SEC amends case against Justin Sun to establish jurisdiction BiT Global board director Rob Liu, highlighted the fiduciary duty of BiT Global in Hong Kong. \u201cBiT Global is structured as a public holding company under the Hong Kong statutory framework. We enter the regulation as TCSP license holder \u2014 what that means is we are in a fiduciary duty to make sure that customer assets are safeguarded according to law and not subject to arbitrary use by anybody,\u201d Liu noted.\u00a0 Meow questioned how market participants could gain confidence in BiT Global\u2019s operational processes. \u201cFrom the outside looking in, there\u2019s actually no way to ascertain how good the processes of BiT Global are in terms of custody and everything,\u201d he said. Belshe said the same technology used by BitGo \u201chas been cloned\u201d for use by BiT Global. Regarding Sun, Belshe reiterated during the X space that Sun is not an employee of BiT Global and that under Hong Kong laws, a single person isn\u2019t allowed to have above a 20% ownership in a public company. Sun, who was on the call, kept mostly silent. He chimed in at the end to add, \u201cour top priority is to protect the community and protect the users.\u201d BitGo\u2019s WBTC dominates the bitcoin DeFi market on Ethereum today, with a market share of 98.8%, according to Dune data. But the public consternation to BitGo\u2019s plans may leave an opening for others, both centralized and decentralized, to gain wider adoption. On the centralized front, Coinbase is presumed to be launching a potential WBTC competitor. The exchange teased on Wednesday in a pair of tweets that \u201ccbBTC\u201d is \u201cComing Soon.\u201d Projects that make use of Bitcoin\u2019s Tapscript, such as dlcBTC, are coming online to provide non-custodial alternatives to getting bitcoin on Ethereum. Read more: Building a better wrapped bitcoin for DeFi Wrapped bitcoin itself is also gaining greater utility. Liquid restaking token (LRT) specialists Swell has recently introduced swBTC, a Bitcoin LRT that wraps WBTC \u2014 with BitGo\u2019s blessing \u2014 to offer new avenues for holders to earn yield via restaking. Launched on Symbiotic, EigenLayer, and Karak, swBTC holder\u2019s yield comes in exchange for providing economic security to these networks, and potentially from further DeFi strategies. Users can deposit WBTC to receive swBTC, but in the future Swell plans to add native BTC swaps directly through THORChain. The launch is part of Swell\u2019s broader initiative to expand restaking opportunities across blockchain networks, with swBTC joining other offerings of staked and restaked ether: swETH and rswETH. To maintain its dominance, BitGo will likely have some fence-mending ahead, given the criticism unleashed. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite a hard pill for the community to swallow, at least in 60 days,\u201d Meow said at the close of the X space. Belshe appeared well aware of the challenges. Over that time period, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be working with all of the big DeFi projects that are touching wrapped bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a community that has to decide whether it wants to do this or doesn\u2019t want to do this.\u201d Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "body": "Say what you will about Trump. He (or his team) has figured out passive crypto income. Vending machines, rental properties and affiliate marketing are usually the strategies of choice for passive income influencers. Not Trump. The former president and second-term hopeful is benefitting from two distinct onchain phenomena: secondary NFT sales and, increasingly, token taxes paid by unofficial memecoins. Over the weekend, Blockworks looked into Trump\u2019s finances, thanks to some publicly released disclosures. The former president has $635 million in assets, hundreds of millions of dollars revenue from properties including Mar-a-Lago and various golf courses, and millions of dollars in royalties. Read more: Memecoin taxes and NFT royalties are paying off for Trump Part of those royalties were $7.2 million in licensing fees from NFT INT LLC, the company which licensed Trump\u2019s likeness for the official Trump Digital Trading Card NFT collections on Polygon. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  Much of Trump\u2019s assets are meanwhile in US Treasurys and other bonds, reports CBS. There\u2019s index funds and stocks, as well as 114.75 million shares in his media company DJT, currently worth $2.65 billion. The shares will be tradable in September, after a six-month lock-up period expires. Read more: How US presidencies map to crypto markets And then there\u2019s a disclosure of between $1 million and $5 million ether, as well as between $100,000 and $250,000 in gold bars (Arkham Intelligence puts Trump\u2019s ether holdings at $2.26 million).\u00a0 What isn\u2019t represented granularly in the disclosure is that Trump\u2019s crypto wallets (particularly on Ethereum and Polygon) are currently raking in tens of thousands of dollars every month through no continued effort of Trump\u2019s team. Blockchain data shows that Trump\u2019s first three NFT collections altogether brought in up to 1,237 ETH in their respective first weeks, which would account for the initial drops. Based on the daily value of ETH, those sales would\u2019ve brought in $2.14 million to Trump\u2019s Polygon wallet, but the same amount of crypto would fetch almost $3.2 million today. Trump Digital Trading Cards also carry a 10% royalty fee for secondary sales, and Trump\u2019s Polygon wallet has received an additional 782.32 ETH ($2 million) outside of the initial collection sales, going back to January 2023. Perfectly decent passive income from Trump NFT traders. But that NFT revenue is drying up and will likely continue to do so until we see a fourth drop (which Trump has hinted at). Trump\u2019s wallet earns a few hundred dollars at best per day from NFT trades right now and often under $10. Luckily, a raft of illegitimate memecoins on Ethereum are paying a steady stream of ether to Trump\u2019s Ethereum wallet, as shown on the chart above. Read more: Web3 Watch: A second Trump token fiasco Save America, Trump Bucks and a few different \u201cTrump Fund\u201d coins pay a 2% auto-tax to Trump on every transfer, and so far those token contracts have paid over 5,100 individual donations (readers should be cautious about interacting with any of those tokens). The donations are fractions of an ETH each, but they do add up: 137.3 ETH in the past four months, nearly $480,000 at the time of transaction and $354,000 at current prices.\u00a0 Over the same period, NFT royalties have earned Trump\u2019s wallet about 4.5 ETH ($11,600 at current prices). Annualizing those combined comes to over 425 ETH, or $1.09 million today. Not bad for sitting back and letting crypto do its thing. That\u2019s over 10 times more than Trump\u2019s pension from the Screen Actors Guild, and higher than his reported royalties from The Apprentice over the past year.

        "published": "August 16, 2024 12:30 pm",
        "publish_date": "2024-08-16",
        "author": "Donovan Choy",
        "body": "The growing negative sentiment around crypto\u2019s current infrastructural bloat and absence of consumer applications is reaching a fever pitch. It\u2019s such a familiar talking point across social media and podcasts that it has largely become a consensus view. Prior cycles saw the innovation of smart contract-enabled blockchains, ICOs, DeFi, layer-2s and NFTs, but the bulk of the present cycle\u2019s new tools are memecoins and increasingly redundant infrastructure.\u00a0 By L2Beat\u2019s count, there are already 71 live L2s, with another 82 incoming. And that\u2019s not even counting layer-3s. Why so many? The most obvious explanation is that it\u2019s profitable to launch one. In an industry where investors are still scrambling to figure out methods of \u201cfundamental\u201d valuation, the standard way to value a new upcoming L2 is to do a comparative analysis \u2014 or \u201ccomps\u201d \u2014 to the biggest L2s to determine its potential value. The general idea is that since the largest have amassed multibillion dollar valuations, newer L2s riding that market narrative should at least command a sizable fraction too. It\u2019s testament to perhaps one of crypto\u2019s most successful investing themes, the \u201cFat Protocol Thesis.\u201d Written by Union Square Ventures\u2019 Joel Monegro in 2016, the thesis argues that value accrual to the infrastructural layer of Web3 will amass the greatest value, in stark contrast to Web2 where value has leaked from the TCP/IP/SMTP protocol layers into the walled gardens of Big Tech. That idea has played out for the most part; of the top 30 crypto tokens by market capitalization today, 18 are L1s or L2s. And thanks to Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers like Conduit and Caldera, launching a rollup chain today has never been easier. The result is a jungle of almost identical rollups competing for mercenary capital. Conduit Founder Andrew Huang claims his company\u2019s focus is on projects with \u201cunique differentiation from day one.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t disagree that there are copy and paste L2s with little differentiation creating user fatigue between rollups,\u201d Huang told Blockworks. Market participants may be finally expressing their rejection of the rollup meta. For instance, the hyped Blast L2 launched its token at a $2.7 billion FDV, falling severely short of market expectations. It has since cratered to just over $1 billion. Read more: Blast incentives aim to attract strong devs, as value leaks There\u2019s more than outsized marketing plays behind the rollup proliferation story. For most application builders on a chain, cost-minimization is also a driving factor. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a pattern of more rollup deployment because as dapps become popular, the \u2018rent\u2019 they pay to the L1/L2 becomes prohibitively expensive,\u201d Huang said. \u201cChains like Base receive $50 millions in fees but dapps don\u2019t receive a cent.\u201d Launch your own app-specific rollup, however, and dapps capture that revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly rational business decision,\u201d he said. Despite the infrastructural progress, there are those who argue it\u2019s still nowhere near enough. Limitations of existing rollups, both tangible and intangible, remain \u2014 like fragmented liquidity and other points of friction in the user experience. Read more: Skate takes an app-centric approach to L2 fragmentation Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric vision is exacerbating the situation, Caldera CEO Matt Katz told Blockworks, \u201cwith potentially tens of thousands more in the future.\u201d \u201cThese rollups are isolated and struggle to communicate with each other,\u201d Katz said, noting that connecting via\u00a0 Ethereum mainnet is slow and expensive. \u201cThere needs to be a more efficient way.\u201d In Katz\u2019 view, apps and infrastructure have to work together. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think of it as a zero-sum game,\u201d he said. Another area where infrastructural development is still lacking is interoperability, which extends beyond cross-chain bridges. This is sometimes referred to as \u201cchain abstraction\u201d, a broad design philosophy that aims to remove all the inconveniences of cross-chain movements for the average onchain user. Read more: If we don\u2019t make crypto invisible, it will never reach the mainstream Shared settlement bridges like Polygon\u2019s AggLayer and Zksync\u2019s Elastic Chain will help, according to Wei Dai research partner at 1kx. \u201cWith better interoperability infrastructure, there\u2019ll be less of a need to rely on external facilitators for high risk cross-chain transfers,\u201d Dai told Blockworks. \u201cShared sequencers can guarantee atomic swap transactions across rollup chains, which is a huge user experience improvement,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Yes, some areas of infrastructure are overfunded and many will fail, Dai said. \u201cBut there are also underfunded areas such as AVS tooling and interoperability layers that are very much lacking,\u201d he added. Dismissing infrastructural build out may be premature, the thinking goes. After all, the value of infrastructural development is often not immediately obvious. Many of today\u2019s cherished consumer innovations are largely emergent and unplanned outcomes, resulting from the painstaking work of piecemeal improvements in infrastructure over decades. Netflix, for instance, was a mail-order movie rental business for ten years before broadband internet availability enabled quality on-demand streaming at scale today. So is the infrastructure ready for consumer app builders? Vitalik Buterin, for one, believes developers \u201cno longer have any excuse.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cUp until a couple of years ago, we were setting ourselves a low standard, building applications that were clearly not usable at scale, as long as they worked as prototypes and were reasonably decentralized,\u201d he wrote in a May blog post, \u201cToday, we have all the tools we\u2019ll need, and indeed most of the tools we\u2019ll ever have, to build applications that are simultaneously cypherpunk and user-friendly.\u201d Venture funds may already be catching on to the valuation trap. In the second quarter this year, the share of crypto infrastructural investment has fallen to 15% \u2014 down from 24% quarter-over-quarter, according to Galaxy Research. Infrastructure builders are hard at work, but it\u2019s not like consumer app builders are asleep at the wheel. Seed Club, a venture fund organized as a DAO that runs consumer crypto-focused accelerators saw 350 project applications in its last accelerator, according to Josh Cornelius, Partner at Seed Club. \u201cHistorically, we haven\u2019t been able to build great consumer products cheaply on the blockchain and bring them to market easily until the last six months,\u201d Cornelius told Blockworks. He attributes the success of memecoins and protocols like Farcaster to the growth of abundant and cheap blockspace and developments like embedded wallet technology. Why, then, haven\u2019t consumer applications taken off? For Cornelius, one big sticking point that remains is marketing \u2014 \u201cthe sociocultural side of things.\u201d \u201cThe hardest challenge for consumer builders is getting users to understand the novel, differentiated experiences that crypto and blockchains are bringing,\u201d Cornelius said. Old go-to-market strategies won\u2019t cut it anymore. \u201cWe need founders who are great brand builders plugged in culturally outside of crypto, and can just go tell the stories of what\u2019s happening here in accessible and culturally-relevant ways,\u201d he said.

Now that I\u2019ve spiked your anxiety, I want you to define neutrality.\u00a0 A CoinDesk report Thursday investigated EigenLayer for distributing a list of employee wallet addresses ahead of airdrops.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to make clear that we have no knowledge or evidence of any employee at Eigen Labs pressuring any team to unduly benefit the Eigen Labs corporate entity or its employees,\u201d Eigen Labs said in a community update last night. It also seeks any evidence of \u201cimproper behavior.\u201d The TL;DR is that employees at Eigen Labs reportedly received crypto from projects working in the ecosystem, and as I said earlier, wallet addresses were supposedly distributed. This isn\u2019t the first time that Eigen Labs has faced this type of scrutiny. The firm pointed out that it initially changed its incentive policy back in May after Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist of the Ethereum Foundation signed on as advisers.\u00a0 \u201cAs an Eigenlayer project, we\u2019re in touch with the team regularly and we never had such a request about our upcoming airdrop. Quite the contrary, they help us a lot and I believe projects can reward any person they deem important, it just needs to be vetted by the community first,\u201d Peter Kris, co-founder of Gasp.xyz, told me.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not here to focus on the \u2018did they, didn\u2019t they.\u2019 Instead, this report and the response from Eigen Labs (which changed its policy around such payouts to employees because they claim to want to be neutral) has started an important debate within the space: What does it mean to be neutral and how can projects avoid conflicts of interest? \u201cIt is clear that when contributors accept airdrops as tips, such incentives affect business decisions of the protocol developers,\u201d\u00a0 Tim Shekikhachev, Resolv Labs co-founder, said. \u201cAs compared to public companies where business gifts rarely cover more than a few managers involved in a deal, the conflict of interest in such situations is more pronounced, because the majority of the team can get a benefit and everyone is so aligned to bypass actual governance.\u201d \u201cIronically for strategic VC investors, lack of their protections is at this moment compensated by outsized returns over shorter investment periods, so there does not seem to be an outcry for transparency. People just optimize for other, more critical factors influencing investment decisions.\u201d Newsletter Subscribe to Empire Newsletter  Nika Koreli, co-founder and chief technology officer at Hinkal, said that \u201cprivacy is crucial in trading strategies,\u201d but that \u201ceveryone should play a fair game\u201d or else it puts the industry at risk.\u00a0 When it comes to these types of conversations, there isn\u2019t an easy answer or solution.\u00a0 Mason Borda, CEO of Tokensoft, wonders if these types of payments are \u201cactually worth it at the end of the day.\u201d \u201cEigenLayer has a smart, driven team and that means they will be analyzing all product decisions from multiple angles and evaluating trade offs. Payments to individuals will result in a negligible influence in these conversations,\u201d Borda said. I asked Borda specifically if we need an industry standard moving forward, because as it stands right now the water\u2019s murky.\u00a0 \u201cIt really has to be on the founders,\u201d he said. \u201cFounders should apply whatever standards they have for employees acting as advisors to third parties. Backing into existing industry norms is the best way to stay above board.\u201d Eigen Labs, for its part, says that the \u201ccommunity\u2019s trust in our neutrality is critical\u201d and added that they had taken steps to mitigate potential incentives \u201cmany months ago.\u201d To be fair, May was only about four months ago but the point remains: the team says it tried to get in front of this ahead of time.\u00a0 One thing\u2019s for certain: this report is the spark for a longer and tougher dialogue in crypto. One that could lead to some positive, transparent change in the industry. \u2014 Katherine Ross The cringe is back for EigenLayer. Restaking is meant to be one of Ethereum\u2019s biggest draws. There\u2019s now over 28% of the total ETH supply staked directly to the blockchain, with new records for validator counts every other day. The popularity of ETH staking has driven the native yield down to 3.21% from over 4.2% in the past year. Stakers can earn additional MEV above those rates, but by design, ETH yields shrink as more supply is locked up. Liquid staking platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool allow users to tokenize, trade, stake and otherwise mobilize their ETH stakes for potential gain \u2014 opening the door to boosting yields beyond the native APR. EigenLayer, meanwhile, is gunning to reward restakers with additional native yield that\u2019s reliable. Stakers who would\u2019ve normally gone with Lido to receive stETH could instead simply earn additional rewards for providing economic security to other projects built on EigenLayer (which it calls actively-validated services). That\u2019s been enough for EigenLayer and apps in its orbit like ether.fi, and renzo to eat some of Lido\u2019s lunch.\u00a0 But EigenLayer\u2019s yield functionality isn\u2019t yet live. It could be later this year, but in the meantime, the protocol has been rewarding early restakers with points and an airdrop \u2014 the incentives of choice for yield-bearing DeFi apps this cycle. Sam Kessler and Danny Nelson\u2019s aforementioned report described instances of mutual back scratching between EigenLayer and platforms that utilize it for the benefit of their own users, particularly AltLayer, Ether.fi and Renzo.\u00a0 Over 30% of EigenLayer\u2019s TVL currently comes from Ether.fi and nearly 9% from Renzo. It\u2019s obviously not a good look. Putting aside that nudging blockchain startups to pledge fealty to your employees would smack of cartel behavior, the gaming of airdrops through Sybil attacks is one of crypto\u2019s longest and most painful headaches.\u00a0 And considering EigenLayer itself heavily restricted recipients of its own EIGEN airdrop (not yet tradable) in May, in a bid to weed out fake users, the whole situation leads to a whole lot of awkward questions, as Katherine outlined above. It\u2019s too early to say whether this will have any material impact on EigenLayer, the Ethereum staking landscape or the wider crypto space. And based on Kessler and Nelson\u2019s findings, similar stuff is almost certainly happening elsewhere. We do know that inflows flipped negative for the first time in months after EigenLayer released the EIGEN whitepaper and details of its airdrop snapshot date.\u00a0 And its weekly net flows have stayed negative following the report, with rival Symbiotic instead seeing a surge. For what it\u2019s worth, the price of pre-market EIGEN tokens is up 70% over the past few days on points-trading platform Whales Market.\u00a0 The vibes may be off, but something tells me the market will soon forget \u2014 until the next snafu comes along. \u2014 David Canellis Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

He (or his team) have figured out passive crypto income. Vending machines, rental properties and affiliate marketing are usually the strategies of choice for passive income influencers. Trump, instead, is benefitting bigly from two distinct onchain phenomena: secondary NFT sales and, increasingly, token taxes paid by unofficial memecoins. Over the weekend, we got an eye into Trump\u2019s finances: $635 million in assets, hundreds of millions of dollars revenue from properties including Mar-a-Lago and various golf courses, and millions of dollars in royalties. Part of those royalties were $7.2 million in licensing fees from NFT INT LLC, the company which licensed Trump\u2019s likeness for the official Trump Digital Trading Card NFT collections on Polygon. Much of Trump\u2019s assets are meanwhile in US Treasurys and other bonds, index funds and stocks, as well as 114.75 million shares in his media company DJT, currently worth $2.65 billion. Those shares will be tradable in September, after a six-month lock-up period expires. And then there\u2019s a disclosure of between $1 million and $5 million ether, as well as between $100,000 and $250,000 in gold bars (Arkham Intelligence puts Trump\u2019s ether holdings at $1.28 million with an additional $976,000 in WETH).\u00a0 What isn\u2019t represented granularly in the disclosure is that Trump\u2019s crypto wallets (particularly on Ethereum and Polygon) are currently raking in tens of thousands of dollars every month through no continued effort of Trump\u2019s team. Blockchain data shows that Trump\u2019s first three NFT collections altogether brought in up to 1,237 ETH in their respective first weeks, which would account for the initial drops. Based on the daily value of ETH, those sales would\u2019ve brought in $2.14 million to Trump\u2019s Polygon wallet, but the same amount of crypto would fetch almost $3.2 million today. Trump Digital Trading Cards also carry a 10% royalty fee for secondary sales, and Trump\u2019s Polygon wallet has received an additional 782.32 ETH ($2 million) outside of the initial collection sales, going back to January 2023. Perfectly decent passive income from Trump NFT traders. But that NFT revenue is drying up and will likely continue to do so until we see a fourth drop (which Trump has hinted at). Trump\u2019s wallet earns a few hundred dollars at best per day from NFT trades right now and often under $10. Luckily, a raft of illegitimate memecoins on Ethereum are paying a steady stream of ether to Trump\u2019s Ethereum wallet, as shown on the chart above. Newsletter Subscribe to Empire Newsletter  Save America, Trump Bucks and a few different \u2018Trump Fund\u2019 coins pay a 2% auto-tax to Trump on every transfer, and so far, those token contracts have paid over 5,100 individual donations. The donations are fractions of an ETH each, but they do add up: 137.3 ETH in the past four months, or $354,000 at current prices. Over the same period, NFT royalties have earned Trump\u2019s wallet about 4.5 ETH ($11,600). Now let\u2019s wait to see if Trump discloses unofficial memecoin tax revenue on his next disclosure. That would be true adoption. \u2014 David Canellis Would you like the good news or the bad news first?\u00a0 We\u2019re starting the week off on a bit of a weaker foot, with bitcoin sub $60,000 and the overall market cap losing roughly 3% in the past 24 hours. Memecoin WIF is trailing the market, down about 22% in the past seven days per CoinGecko.\u00a0 Though FalconX\u2019s David Lawant noted that TON remains a strong outperformer. \u201cThe ETH/BTC ratio slightly recovered but it remains at low 0.045, not far from its three-year lows. Turnover shrunk from the elevated levels seen over the past couple of weeks but is still slightly above the averages seen in June and July,\u201d Lawant wrote. Outside of the general market though, Lawant looked at the current correlation between bitcoin and the presidential election, given that we\u2019re only a few months out (wow time flies).\u00a0 Current Polymarket odds give Democratic nominee Kamala Harris a 51% chance of winning, with Trump trailing behind slightly at 47%. The market is worth over $640 million. But, despite all of the chatter around the election and crypto\u2019s role in a new administration, Lawant pointed out that there really isn\u2019t a discernible trend between the November election and bitcoin\u2019s price. It\u2019s still, when you look closely, it\u2019s more tied to the stock market (though it\u2019s trailing benchmarks at the moment).\u00a0 Trump, back in July, took the lead as bettors backed the former president in his reelection campaign following his assassination attempt. But, as we all know by now, the entire situation has changed, including the candidates.\u00a0 Anyway, Lawant plotted out the odds in a dot plot, seen below. From the first of June to the end of last week, there isn\u2019t yet a correlation between the odds and bitcoin\u2019s reaction, as seen by the dots representing the momentum from Republicans and, conversely, the Democrats catching up. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t still time though.\u00a0 \u201cA strong relationship between Republican win odds and BTC prices would look like an upward-sloping line with a 45-degree angle. Conversely, a strong relationship between BTC prices and a Democrat win would look like a downward-sloping line with the same 45-degree angle. We can only identify a fuzzy cloud instead,\u201d Lawant wrote. Policy and a new potential approach to regulation are on the line in November, depending on who you listen to. But it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s enough to force a market movement just yet. And, honestly, perhaps that\u2019s for the best.\u00a0 \u2014 Katherine Ross Q: What would you like to see from a pro-crypto president? Easy answers would be stuff like holding all the bitcoin seized from criminals as a treasury reserve asset \u2014 like what has already been proposed.\u00a0 Adding onto that: The US government is sitting on $130 million in ether, which was seized from a variety of cases.\u00a0 A truly pro-crypto president would stake that ETH and earn a yield \u2014 over $4 million per year at current prices \u2014 and direct that revenue toward something useful, preferably at the local level. But considering there\u2019s almost $12 billion in bitcoin sitting alongside those ETH coffers, it feels like doing something with it, apart from simply selling it on Coinbase, is probably the most tangible net good for \u201ccrypto.\u201d And if government contractors and vendors simply won\u2019t accept bitcoin \u2014 at least swap it for USDC and encourage them to accept stablecoins instead.\u00a0 A \u201ccrypto for payments president\u201d might be just the thing we need. \u2014 David Canellis Actual policy.\u00a0 I\u2019m a big fan of people putting action behind their words, and would prefer to see some real substance before I jump in the boat of anyone in the White House being pro-crypto.\u00a0 The appointments out of the Trump campaign last week, where they announced Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick (who\u2019s seen as pro-crypto, specifically pro-Tether), could be interpreted as action, but that\u2019s not really what I mean.\u00a0 When actual policy (and not just promises) is announced and legislation is encouraged, then perhaps someone can actually call themselves a pro-crypto president. But right now there\u2019s just a lot of talk from both sides.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ve got 78 days until the election though, so anything could change. \u2014 Katherine Ross"

One thing we\u2019ve talked about a lot here is that some in the venture capital space are now looking past the infrastructure raises. PitchBook\u2019s Robert Le told me just last week that there are \u201ctoo many L1s,\u201d for example.\u00a0 Though he noted that, throughout last quarter and earlier this year, \u201cblockchain infrastructure such as layer-1s, scaling solutions and staking/restaking remained areas with strong investor interest in Q2\u201d in his second quarter report earlier this month. There are, as always, some exceptions. Both Berachain and Monad raised a significant amount of capital earlier this year. ICYMI: Berachain raised $100 million in a Series B, while Monad raised $225 million. Those two rounds are well within the top 5 megaraises this year, alongside Farcaster\u2019s $150 million round and Zentry\u2019s $140 million round. To fill out that group, Babylon raised $70 million in an early-stage round. Last month, I spoke to Michael Anderson of Framework Ventures, and he told me that this cycle, he\u2019s watching and \u201cspending a lot of time on\u201d Monad and Berachain. Framework, to be fair, is an investor in Berachain. Specifically with Berachain, Anderson said that the team is showing off its ability to innovate. Something that our team at Blockworks Research also noted in a research report last week. \u201cThey have some crazy concepts that they are building on that are just so crazy they just might work,\u201d Anderson said. He specifically cited Puffpaw which is a vape-to-earn DePIN app building on Berachain that aims to reward folks for quitting vaping.\u00a0 This type of building actually supports what Le is looking for. In his second quarter report, he wrote that he\u2019ll be looking for projects that are building for non-crypto-native users to receive attention and investments.\u00a0 Berachain\u2019s Smokey, on the Empire podcast, said, \u201cI think you do need stuff that lay people can use and people actually care about if they have a couple hundred dollars or a thousand dollars in their bank account.\u201d Smokey stated that the \u201cchain should not be the main character,\u201d because \u201cat the end of the day, the apps are what matter. Part of Berachain\u2019s push will be to highlight that and try to give the apps, like the vape-to-earn one, a chance at success.\u00a0 For Monad\u2019s Keone Hon, an app should offer \u201cinherent value to the end user so that they keep coming back rather than being purely motivated by some sort of temporary incentive or temporary condition that maybe logic would dictate is not going to last.\u201d Last week, we talked about how venture capital funding might not bounce back to 2022 levels any time soon, but perhaps that\u2019s not a bad thing.\u00a0 Newsletter Subscribe to Empire Newsletter  At least the projects that have caught the attention of VCs seem focused on delivering results that could improve the ecosystem. And they\u2019re keen to offer potential ways to bring back the non-crypto native crowd. \u2014 Katherine Ross\u00a0 Crypto is anti-credentialist. A cypherpunk sandbox for coding anything and everything, backed by an open-source ethos that encourages forking and other forms of entrepreneurial riffing. But there\u2019s also a massive cohort of cryptocurrencies and blockchains being built by teams led or advised by professors, either former or current.\u00a0 Some of the biggest projects in the space are powered by professors. Hedera, Bittensor, Stellar, Arbitrum, Algorand, Chainlink and Avalanche all have either been founded by, or employed professors among their senior leadership.\u00a0 Other projects have enlisted professors as advisers, including Aptos, Filecoin, Ondo and Theta Network and even MakerDAO for a time a few years back.\u00a0 For the sake of neatness, we can probably label projects with professors in advisory roles \u201chonorary\u201d professor coins, while the fully-fledged moniker can be reserved for coins with professors in decision-making roles.\u00a0 Out of the top 150 or so cryptocurrencies by market cap, there are 20 professor coins and another 10 honorary coins. It\u2019s easy to see why academics might be drawn to crypto. Blockchain has been filled with white space \u2014 the odds of creating novel utility with crypto has been incredibly high for over a decade.\u00a0 There\u2019s also a certain old-world credibility that comes with having professors either on staff or steering the ship.\u00a0 Crypto is, however, clearly a middle finger to the establishment, despite recent moves to meld it with traditional finance and even two-party politics. Professor coins then make for an awkward fit at times.\u00a0 Cardano, for instance, has for the longest time been positioned as the peer-reviewed blockchain created in consultation with esteemed academics. Newcomers may find that messaging enticing, but crypto natives would probably find it embarrassing. And this translates to some mediocre returns for professor coins.\u00a0 Over the past five years, only eight professor coins have beaten bitcoin: FTM, THETA, QNT, ADA, KAS, and the three AI-related tokens that just merged into one, FET, OCEAN and AGIX. Not to mention two-fifths of the analyzed professor coins are in the red over the same period, with ICP, FIL, MINA, ALGO, STRK losing more than 80% of their value. Does this mean professor coins are doomed? Probably not. This analysis was purely surface level and any connection between the performance of professor coins is almost certainly correlation without the causation. But they do make for an easy target when there\u2019s blood in the streets. Thankfully, we\u2019re not there yet \u2014 outside of the coins on the chart above, that is. \u2014 David Canellis Q: Is X the new LinkedIn of crypto? Two years ago, I would have immediately said yes.\u00a0 That was the height of the \u201cintern\u201d meta. Crypto projects, alongside Web2 and TradFi brands, all fronted their Twitter accounts with a phony intern \u2014 more than likely a marketing executive \u2014 that would communicate with other users on their level. Degen-to-degen.\u00a0 Shitposting was, all of a sudden, an audition to work your dream job. This trend seems well past its peak, and a lot of the fun on X has faded along with it.\u00a0 That said, people do still get hired based on the content they produce on X.\u00a0 It\u2019s the accounts posting deep-dives to under 300 followers for a few likes and a retweet that now present some of the most value. Hire them, not the shitposters. \u2014 David Canellis Let\u2019s face it: LinkedIn\u2019s for boomers. It\u2019s boring (don\u2019t hate me, chronically online LinkedIn-ers) and I find it hard to interact with anyone on there. I use it mostly as an ever-evolving resume so that people can see that I\u2019m not just full of crap.\u00a0 X (RIP Twitter) is a better way to gauge someone\u2019s personality and their strengths. It\u2019s also far easier to interact with other users than LinkedIn.\u00a0 For crypto specifically, it helps to understand a person and their potential strengths before just cold-DMing them. Or perhaps that\u2019s just the journalist in me talking.\u00a0 Anyway, CT gives folks a better look into what\u2019s being built or what, say, devs are working on than a LinkedIn post. I guess you can fight me on that.\u00a0 \u2014 Katherine Ross\u00a0 Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter.

Welcome to the On the Margin Newsletter, brought to you by Ben Strack and Casey Wagner. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll find in today\u2019s edition: Ah, Polymarket.\u00a0 The betting app \u2014 or \u201cprediction market,\u201d as the company describes itself \u2014 is all the rage these days. Total crypto assets on Polymarket have tripled this year, according to DeFiLlama data. Users have wagered $606.6 million on the US presidential election outcome alone. Bets start at just $0.44. It\u2019s a remarkably low barrier to entry \u2014 that is, if you\u2019re not a US citizen.\u00a0 That\u2019s right. Polymarket, in theory, blocks US residents and citizens from using the platform, as stipulated by a 2022 settlement with the CFTC. Per the agreement, Polymarket paid $1.4 million in civil penalties for allegedly running an unregistered platform for trading options contracts. Polymarket did not confirm or deny the allegations, but they agreed to ban US users.\u00a0 According to the CFTC, the bets that Polymarket facilitates \u2014\u00a0 such as \u201cHow many times will Trump tweet this week?\u201d or \u201cIs the Bieber baby a boy or girl?\u201d \u2014 are derivatives and thus under the agency\u2019s purview.\u00a0 \u201cAll derivatives markets must operate within the bounds of the law regardless of the technology used, and particularly including those in the so-called decentralized finance or \u2018DeFi\u2019 space,\u201d CFTC acting director of enforcement Vincent McGonagle said in 2022.\u00a0 Of course, we know there are Americans using Polymarket, just as we know US residents found workarounds to use other \u201cbanned\u201d platforms like FTX and Binance. Polymarket\u2019s terms of service prohibit the use of VPNs, but you don\u2019t have to look hard to find step-by-step instructions on how to circumvent the rules.\u00a0 American statistician and journalist Nate Silver joined Polymarket as an adviser earlier this year. Other investors include Peter Thiel and Vitalik Buterin.\u00a0 \u201cProbabilities really matter when you\u2019re trying to make plans,\u201d Silver told Axios last month.\u00a0 Now, more than two years after the CFTC\u2019s settlement, lawmakers and regulators are showing renewed interest in cracking down on election gambling. In May, the agency issued a proposed rule to ban all derivatives trading related to US elections.\u00a0 Eight Democratic senators and representatives cosigned a letter earlier this month urging the CFTC to ban political betting markets, which they argued \u201ccould influence and interfere with election\u201d results.\u00a0 Newsletter Subscribe to On The Margin Newsletter  To be clear, the CFTC has not charged Polymarket with violating its 2022 settlement.\u00a0 The rule, if passed, would likely have a greater impact on Polymarket competitors Kalshi and PredictIt, neither of which accept crypto payments. Kalshi is registered with the CFTC but is currently suing the agency for denying contracts for election betting.\u00a0 PredictIt also sued the CFTC back in 2022 after regulators attempted to shut down the platform. The company was granted a temporary injunction the following year, allowing it to continue operating in the US. For now, PredictIt still offers election contracts.\u00a0 The pushback from industry heavyweights appears to focus on how the proposed CFTC rule would impact Polymarket, despite the fact that the 2022 settlement essentially already enforces (at least in theory) these regulations.\u00a0 Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss penned a letter to CFTC secretary Christopher Kirkpatrick earlier this month, expressing outrage that the agency is trying to deny Americans access to prediction markets like Polymarket.\u00a0 I guess the Winklevii never got the memo re: the 2022 settlement? I\u2019d take that bet.\u00a0 \u2014 Casey Wagner\u00a0 The combined value of National Pension Service\u2019s shares of Coinbase ($51 million) and MicroStrategy ($34 million) as of the second quarter, according to a recent filing.\u00a0 The South Korean public pension fund (the world\u2019s third-largest) had also held COIN shares in Q1, but it decreased that position by roughly 24,000 shares quarter over quarter. The allocation to MSTR was new. Despite the fund opting to allocate to these crypto stocks, the disclosure indicates it did not hold any bitcoin ETFs as of June 30. Casey wrote yesterday about Sen. Chuck Schumer\u2019s Wednesday night appearance, and pledge, at a virtual \u201cCrypto4Harris\u201d event. The likes of Mark Cuban and Anthony Scaramucci also showed face. But declarations during the event appeared to ring hollow for some given that neither VP Kamala Harris, nor a member of her team, spoke.\u00a0 The gathering of Democrats came as industry watchers await to see whether Harris offers a \u201creset\u201d of sorts on crypto policy \u2014 a move expected to attract a portion of what many deem to be a key voting bloc in November.\u00a0 Veronica McGregor, chief legal officer at crypto wallet Exodus, said some of the expectations for Crypto4Harris\u2019s \u201cintroductory\u201d event may have been a bit \u201cunreasonable.\u201d While the group has members in contact with people close to Harris, she added, the VP\u2019s presidential campaign is young. Biden dropped out (and endorsed Harris) just 26 days ago.\u00a0 \u201cExpecting on short notice to be able to get either the vice president, or her folks, on such a call right now I think would be a pretty heavy lift,\u201d McGregor told Blockworks. Still, eyes remain on how the presumed Democratic nominee positions herself on this issue. Despite more Democrats showing support for crypto in recent months, Joe Biden vetoed a resolution set to ax the SEC\u2019s SAB 121. \u201cWhile people want to saddle her with ownership of everything the Biden administration has done or not done with crypto, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair,\u201d McGregor argued.\u00a0 On the other side, Trump said he would back the bitcoin mining industry and floated a number of other crypto-related promises at last month\u2019s Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for a sitting vice president to sort of throw grenades the same way her opposition can,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cThere are people calling for her to announce she\u2019s going to fire Gary Gensler. You can say that as a campaign promise; as a practical matter it\u2019s a very different thing.\u201d The Exodus executive said she may speak at a future Crypto4Harris event. McGregor had also been in contact with the Trump campaign this summer. She noted her company \u2014 whose public listing was delayed by the SEC in May \u2014 is willing to back candidates of either party in favor of \u201csensible, practical and appropriate\u201d crypto regulation. Harris was expected to reveal economic plan details during a Friday speech in North Carolina around the time this newsletter was being published. McGregor said she was unsure if crypto would be a \u201cplank in the platform,\u201d but noted she was watching for something about \u201cfostering innovation and technology in a responsible and appropriate way.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 The bottom line, McGregor added: \u201cWhat would be helpful is if we heard from [Harris\u2019s] campaign that \u2026 we are going to recalibrate and not do regulation by enforcement, because that practice is very destructive.\u201d It seems we all agree we want to know more.\u00a0 \u2014 Ben Strack Happy Friday! It was a relatively quiet week, which I\u2019m sure was welcome after last week\u2019s market turmoil. Still, economic data was a bit of a mixed bag, putting markets in a precarious position ahead of next month\u2019s FOMC meeting.
