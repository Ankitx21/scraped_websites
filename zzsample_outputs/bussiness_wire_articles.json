        "body": "EDINBURGH, Scotland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Space Intelligence, a provider of high-accuracy nature mapping derived from satellite data, announced today that it has raised Series A funding. The round was led by new investors AzurX Space Ventures (ASV) with participation from Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE).\n\n\n\n\nThe funding will be used to expand Space Intelligence\u2019s catalog of mapping data across the world\u2019s forests to support the development and financing of forest carbon projects, as well as nature impact monitoring across corporate supply chains.\n\n\n\u201cTo address the dual climate and biodiversity crises, it\u2019s critical that investment in forest conservation and restoration scales through mechanisms such as the carbon markets and that compliance with legislation like the EU Deforestation Regulation is ensured,\u201d said Dr. Murray Collins, co-founder and CEO of Space Intelligence. \u201cStakeholders across these initiatives need accurate, independent data on land and forest cover that they can trust. While satellite data is now abundant, there is a significant lack of accurate insights consistently available across space and time that enable confident decision-making and reporting. We\u2019ve built an audit-grade dataset by taking a science-led approach to mapping the world\u2019s forests, and this funding will help us accelerate the production of datasets across more regions and time periods.\u201d\n\nSpace Intelligence co-founders Dr. Murray Collins and Professor Ed Mitchard have nearly 40 combined years of academic and on-the-ground research in remote sensing using satellite data. They have grown Space Intelligence to employ more than 50 staff members, including 20 mapping scientists and ecologists. The company\u2019s products are trusted by some of the largest developers and investors in forest carbon projects globally.\n\n\nSpace Intelligence\u2019s nature data catalog currently spans 640 million hectares across seven countries, providing information on land cover, deforestation, and regrowth. By the end of Q2 2025, the company\u2019s dataset will expand to cover more than 35 additional countries, becoming the largest audit-grade nature mapping dataset available. This expansion is driven by the company\u2019s integrated process of geospatial analysis and ecological expertise, leveraging artificial intelligence.\n\n\nThe company is also set to release new data products in Q4 of this year for near real-time monitoring of deforestation and degradation, enhancing risk management and monitoring.\n\n\n\u201cInvesting in space-based technologies, particularly through innovative companies like Space Intelligence, is essential for harnessing the full potential of satellite data in addressing global environmental challenges,\u201d said Anna Hazlett, co-founder and CEO of ASV, a UAE-based space and technology investor. \u201cAs space domain experts, we recognize the critical role these technologies play in driving sustainable development and providing high-accuracy insights for resource management and climate change mitigation.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Space Intelligence, visit www.space-intelligence.com.\n\n\nAbout Space Intelligence\n\nSpace Intelligence is a NatureTech company enabling zero deforestation and mass restoration of biodiverse forests globally by providing the highest quality nature mapping data.\n\n\nWe combine our extensive expertise in remote sensing, data analytics, and forest ecology to provide highly accurate data for forest carbon project stakeholders and nature impact reporting.\n\n\nOur approach is rooted in science, with our co-founders leveraging close to 40 combined years of academic and on-the-ground research to develop our products, which are used and trusted by some of the largest nature-based market participants.\n\n\nAbout ASV\n\nAzurX Space Ventures (ASV) is at the forefront of harnessing the rapid expansion of the space economy, investing in and scaling a global portfolio of space and space-enabled tech companies. As space domain experts, we understand the crucial role these technologies play in transforming industries and solving a wide range of global issues.\n\n\nOur mission is to propel industries into the trillion-dollar space economy, shaping the future of technology and investment. We partner with global investment arms and strategic development funds, and directly invest in visionary founders and ventures at every stage within the space sector.\n\n\nASV is the venture arm of AzurX, a leading entity in the Middle East's private space and satellite professional services sector. Founded by space-champion Anna Hazlett, AzurX collaborates with cutting-edge space companies, providing high-tech access and support for commercial and government space enterprises."

        "body": "VANCOUVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Borealis Biosciences, a next-generation RNA medicines company, today emerged from stealth with $150 million in combined Series A financing from founding investor Versant Ventures and Novartis AG, as well as committed strategic research collaboration funding from Novartis.\n\n\n\n\nDespite recent advances for patients with IgA nephropathy, many other forms of highly prevalent kidney disease remain unaddressed. The understanding of patient subpopulations and distinct underlying pathologies has improved significantly in recent years, but some of the most validated, causal targets have not been amenable to traditional small molecule or biologic modalities.\n\n\nBorealis was founded on the premise that a convergence of scientific and translational breakthroughs can enable RNA therapeutics to address major unmet needs for patients with kidney diseases. These include an improved understanding of patient stratification, genetically defined targets, requirements for delivery of therapeutic payloads to specific kidney cell types, and RNA chemistry advancements.\n\n\nBorealis builds on the success of Chinook Therapeutics, a kidney disease company that was founded by Versant in 2019 and acquired by Novartis last year for up to $3.5 billion. The team is led by a strong group and academic advisors who were central to research at Chinook, together with additional leadership in the field of RNA therapeutics.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recognized over the last six years that some of the most validated targets for kidney disease have been out of reach with traditional modalities. Borealis has the potential to address these targets and reach patients most in need,\u201d said Jerel Davis, Ph.D., managing director at Versant and chairperson of Borealis\u2019 board of directors. \u201cWe are excited to launch this startup in close collaboration with Novartis, as this represents another example of Versant\u2019s creative company-building together with an industry leader.\u201d\n\n\nNovartis collaboration\n\nVersant and Novartis worked together to launch Borealis as an independent company around many key members of Chinook\u2019s Vancouver-based research team. Novartis participated in Borealis\u2019 Series A financing and is committing up to $100 million in upfront plus near-term research funding as part of a strategic research collaboration that complements Novartis priorities in renal medicine and xRNA technology platform innovation.\n\n\nAs part of this agreement, Novartis will have the option to acquire two future development-ready programs from Borealis, with Borealis eligible for up to $750 million in total consideration including clinical and regulatory milestones.\n\n\n\u201cNovartis is committed to bringing forward new therapeutic options for patients with kidney diseases,\u201d said Fiona Marshall, Ph.D., President of Biomedical Research at Novartis. \u201cWe believe Borealis will foster an ideal environment for an exceptional founding team to continue to pioneer renal science and drug discovery, and we are delighted to work with Versant on a partnership that exemplifies creative, collaborative deal-making to enable the launch of this innovative biotech.\u201d\n\n\nExperienced founding team and advisors\n\nBorealis\u2019 initial 25-person team has worked at the forefront of kidney research and RNA therapeutics for more than a decade. The company\u2019s scientific advisors comprise global leaders with deep knowledge of targeted delivery of RNA therapeutics, mechanistic insights into kidney disease, and cutting-edge human-based translational data science. These capabilities have allowed Borealis to map target opportunities across subsets of patients with kidney disease, and to define methods to enhance delivery of RNA medicines to specific cell types.\n\n\n\u201cVersant has had the opportunity to back this team of drug hunters for many years,\u201d said Dr. Davis. \u201cThey are behind numerous clinical-stage and marketed therapies, and we look forward to this group\u2019s continued impact on the field of RNA medicines.\u201d\n\n\nAbout Borealis Biosciences\n\nBorealis is backed by founding investor Versant Ventures and Novartis and has entered into a strategic research collaboration with Novartis. Borealis\u2019 research site is based in Vancouver at the 23,000 square foot operating site formerly leased by Chinook Therapeutics. The facility includes state-of-the-art wet labs for molecular and cellular biology, vivarium space, chemistry and analytical capabilities. The initial 25+ team is made up of experienced drug hunters with extensive expertise in kidney disease, translational systems biology and data sciences, translational biology, chemistry, DMPK and pharmacology.\n\n\nAbout Versant Ventures\n\nVersant Ventures is a leading healthcare venture capital firm committed to helping exceptional entrepreneurs build the next generation of great companies. The firm\u2019s emphasis is on biotechnology companies that are discovering and developing novel therapeutics. With $5.5 billion under management and offices in the U.S., Canada and Europe, Versant has built a team with deep investment, operating and R&D expertise that enables a hands-on approach to company building. Since the firm\u2019s founding in 1999, more than 100 Versant companies have achieved successful acquisitions or IPOs. For more information, please visit www.versantventures.com."

        "body": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gatik, the leader in autonomous middle-mile logistics, today announced a strategic investment from NIPPON EXPRESS HOLDINGS, INC. (NX Group), a global logistics leader. This investment will further strengthen Gatik\u2019s position in the North American logistics landscape, accelerating the deployment of its autonomous technology across the region.\n\n\n\n\nGatik\u2019s momentum continues to build as the company leverages a series of strategic investment partnerships to solidify its leadership in the middle-mile segment of the supply chain. Specializing in the often-overlooked routes between distribution centers, fulfillment centers and retail locations, Gatik addresses critical challenges like driver shortages and supply chain inefficiencies, resulting in faster deliveries and reduced costs. With its autonomous transportation network already operating successfully in regions such as Texas and Arkansas in the U.S., and Ontario, Canada, Gatik is reshaping the North American logistics landscape. Recent investment partnerships with Isuzu Motors and ITOCHU further accelerate this transformation, underscoring the industry\u2019s confidence in Gatik\u2019s safe, transparent, and regulator-approved approach to middle-mile autonomy.\n\n\n\u201cMiddle-mile autonomy is undoubtedly the first application in autonomous trucking to achieve scale in commercial applications.

BrandProject led the pre-seed round and is responsible for Daily Harvest, Our Place, Wonderbelly, Gainful, PORTA, The Gleamery, and more. Additional investments include Midnight Venture Partners and Tonic Ventures, with Angel investments from Lukas Keindl, Co-founder of BondVet, Andy Grover, Co-founder of Tend Dental, Elizabeth Cutler, Co-founder of SoulCycle, and Meghan Maupin, Founder of Atolla Skincare (acquired by Function of Beauty) and current CEO of OurX.\n\n\n\n\nHair loss occurs in men and women across ages, for a variety of reasons. It can be daunting to seek solutions or speak openly about one\u2019s experiences with peers, but Great Many is on a mission to destigmatize those conversations. Launched in June 2024, the new venture by beauty industry veterans Michael Pollak (Co-Founder of Heyday and Advisor to WTHN) and Steve Klebanow (former exec at Est\u00e9e Lauder and Co-Founder of Haar & Co Barbershop) seeks to make hair growth an answer, not a question. The company opened its flagship growth studio in NoHo on June 4th, with a staff of knowledgeable, compassionate clinicians and hair experts who provide services for men and women seeking to grow or preserve hair.\n\n\n\u201cIn the last 10+ years, there have been so many concepts launched making skincare and aesthetics more accessible \u2013 from facial shops to med spas to cosmetic dermatologist offices. We know how much hair matters to people, yet the space still leaves people confused, full of myths, and without a high-touch solution,\u201d says Co-Founders, Michael Pollak and Steve Klebanow. \u201cGreat Many is home for hair growth and 100% dedicated to providing expert-led, personalized hair growth plans \u2013 revolutionizing hair health in the same way specialized clinics did for skincare. We are excited for people to have a plan and partner in maximizing their hair\u2019s potential.\u201d\n\n\nIn securing this pre-seed, Great Many is launching two new pillars of the business to propel their mission beyond the walls of their NoHo clinic, ensuring that the brand is the go-to destination for all things hair growth across the US. The expansion includes a proprietary line of four hair care products powered by its GrowthFactor Formula\u2122 ingredient complex, alongside telehealth services to support consultations for those outside of NYC.\n\n\nThe new GrowthFactor Formula\u2122 product line will consist of a GreaterThan Shampoo, GreaterThan Conditioner, RootSupport Densifying Serum, and RootRest Scalp Treatment ranging individually from $34-$49 with bundles available.

        "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Molina Healthcare of Ohio (\u201cMolina\u201d) awarded a $125,000 grant to the Center for Community Based Care (CCBC), the nonprofit foundation arm of the Ohio Council for Home Care & Hospice (OCHCH). The investment will fund efforts to address the shortage of nurses in home care and hospice settings and support a new hotline aiding Ohioans managing serious illnesses from home.\n\n\n\n\nA U.S. Department of Resources and Services Administration survey showed a decrease of 5,700 registered nurses working in home health and hospice settings from 2018 to 2022, despite there being over 214,000 more registered nurses employed during that time. A need of an additional 275,000 nurses is projected by 2030. Meanwhile, the home health care population increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic with a spike in telehealth appointments and usage of in-home medical services.\n\n\n\u201cMolina believes all individuals should have access to high-quality care and our support of CCBC will help create greater capacity for Ohioans to receive care from home,\u201d said Ami Cole, plan president for Molina Healthcare of Ohio. \u201cCCBC is reducing gaps in health equity and we are proud to invest in their work.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUltimately, this gift means better care for patients, and meaningful, rewarding careers for care givers across Ohio,\u201d said Lisa Von Lehmden, executive director of the OCHCH. \u201cMolina\u2019s support will allow us to truly make these community-focused initiatives a reality by supporting our efforts to put Ohio on the map when it comes to supporting home and community-based services and workforce development in a thoughtful, unique, and sustainable way.\u201d\n\n\nTo address the increase in critical home health care needs, the Molina grant will support two key initiatives:\n\n\nHome-Based Nursing Student Clinical Rotations: To address the shortage of nurses in home health and hospice settings, CCBC will partner with Ohio nursing schools to develop home-based clinical rotation experiences for nursing students. These rotations will provide hands-on learning opportunities exposing students to careers in hospice, home care and home-based primary care. Most nursing students rarely experience home-based care, either through a personal or family experience or in their clinical preparation during their nursing education.\n\n\nClinical Advocate Resource Exchange (CARE): This telephone-based program employs patient advocates to provide care navigation assistance for patients and care teams by connecting them to necessary services, resources, transportation, home care agencies, hospice providers, and more. This will enhance the healthcare continuum while relieving home care clinicians of non-billable tasks required to fully support patients.\n\n\nAbout Molina Healthcare of Ohio\n\nMolina Healthcare of Ohio has been providing government-funded, quality health care since 2005. The Company serves members through Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare-Medicaid (Duals) and Health Insurance Exchange programs throughout Ohio. Through its locally operated health plans, Molina Healthcare, Inc., a Fortune 500 company, provides managed health care services under the Medicaid and Medicare programs, and through state insurance marketplaces.

By connecting families and individuals across Ohio with resources they need, the Center helps families receive the exceptional care they deserve. The Center\u2019s programs connect individuals of all ages to tools and resources to help them remain in their homes and with their families.

        "body": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Efficient Capital Labs (ECL), the leading revenue-based financing provider that provides non-dilutive capital to B2B SaaS companies operating in the South Asia-U.S. corridor, today announced an $11 million Series A fundraise co-led by QED Investors and 645 Ventures. The round included participation from existing investors Riverside and Generalist. New investors FJ Labs and Eudemian Ventures also participated in the funding.\n\n\nThe funding will be used to expand into Singapore and other Southeast Asia markets, building on the successful traction seen in the U.S. and India where ECL has originated more than $70 million in financing and tripled to serve over 100 companies over 12 months from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024.\n\n\n\u201cWe are doubling down on what we have seen since Day 1 \u2013 that the South Asia-U.S. corridor is highly devoid of funding for the simple reason that any cross-border company is never evaluated as a global organization, only as a series of siloed companies in each country,\u201d ECL co-founder and CEO Kaustav Das said. \u201cAs a result, cross-border companies get the short end of the stick and never get financing up to their potential.\u201d\n\n\nToday, a global B2B SaaS company may have $2 million of revenue coming in from the U.S., another $2 million of revenue from India and $1 million of revenue from Singapore. Historically, a revenue-based financing company based in the U.S. would only evaluate this business as a $2 million company because they have zero visibility on what is happening outside the country.\n\n\n\u201cThe way their infrastructure, risk strategies and APIs are built is local,\u201d Das said. \u201cECL is the only revenue-based financing company that evaluates a business\u2019 revenue across every geography to provide a holistic risk assessment, rather than simply looking at one cog in the wheel.\u201d\n\n\nECL increased its accounts receivable outstanding sixfold from 2022 to 2023. In the first six months of 2024, the company has already doubled that number again, in part because of default rates way below industry standards and a 70 percent repeat rate of customers taking additional financings.\n\n\nECL currently lends to cross-border companies that have at least one entity in the U.S. or India and is the only revenue-based financing company that provides two different denominations of loan for the same customer \u2013 USD and INR. By the end of 2024, it will extend this to Singapore dollar-denominated loans, better supporting businesses by uniquely allowing the customer to choose where they want the funding. The advantages include less reliance on foreign exchange (forex) \u2013 exchanging one currency for another \u2013 and avoiding often strict regulations that govern international money movement.\n\n\n\u201cThe fact that VC markets are still so constricted and valuations are still so suppressed is prompting people to look at alternative funding options that they had not explored before, irrespective of how much money they have raised,\u201d ECL co-founder Manish Arora said. \u201cHistorically, revenue-based financing has typically not been as popular in developing countries like India, but in the past two to three years with the reduced availability of VC funding and venture debt markets being challenged, people have started to turn to alternative financing that was not there before.\u201d\n\n\nECL was co-founded in 2022 by Das and Arora. Before founding the business, Das spent more than 20 years in the industry as chief risk officer at multiple organizations, including Kabbage (now a part of American Express), in both commercial and consumer finance sectors. Arora has worked extensively as a senior leader in B2B SaaS, fintech and regulatory technology spaces, most recently as the general manager, South Asia for PayJoy, a San Francisco-headquartered B2B SaaS fintech.\n\n\n\"We are excited to co-lead Efficient Capital Labs' Series A funding round,\u201d said Aaron Holiday, co-founder and managing partner at 645 Ventures. \u201cECL's innovative approach to revenue-based financing for cross-border B2B SaaS companies in the South Asia-U.S. corridor is a game-changer. Their ability to evaluate revenue across geographies and provide non-dilutive capital solutions sets them apart. With an exceptional team and deep domain expertise, they achieve best-in-class unit economics for a revenue-based finance business. We are thrilled to support their continued growth and expansion into new markets.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe have been amazed with the unit economics, credit performance and growth that Kaustav and Manish have been able to achieve since our initial investment over a year ago,\u201d said QED Investors Partner and Head of Asia Sandeep Patil. \u201cThey have surrounded themselves with a terrific team and we are excited to double-down on our partnership -- this round sets the company to explode its TAM and achieve escape velocity.\u201d\n\n\nECL raised a $3.5 million seed round led by 645 Ventures in April 2022, followed by a $15 million debt facility in November 2022 which it updated to a $100 million SPV in June 2023, and a further $7 million pre-Series A round which it announced in July of 2023.\n\n\nECL currently has 25 employees located between the U.S and India. The company expects to grow to 30-35 employees by the end of year, including plans to hire a CRO/CMO, a head of business development and partnerships and additional engineers.\n\n\nAbout ECL\n\nFounded in 2022, Efficient Capital Labs is a New York-headquartered fintech that provides non-dilutive capital to B2B SaaS companies operating in the South Asia-US corridor - i.e., companies that generate a majority of their revenues from the US or North American market while maintaining a significant part of their technology, product development, and operations teams in South Asia.

In 2022, United Airlines made a pre-delivery payment for the first 100 of those aircraft.\n\n\nAlong with this additional capital, Archer also recently announced it had reached the key terms of an agreement with Stellantis for the contribution of significant capital in the form of labor and capital expenditures to help scale the manufacturing of Archer\u2019s aircraft, Midnight. This strategic funding arrangement is intended to give Archer the ability to access up to an additional $400M in capital in exchange for Archer equity at future stock prices with the goal of minimizing dilution.\n\n\nArcher\u2019s high-volume manufacturing facility in Covington, GA, is scheduled to open by the end of the year.\n\n\n\u201cAs we advance towards commercialization, this renewed equity support from partners like United Airlines and Stellantis is a powerful endorsement that solidifies Archer\u2019s position as one of the most well-capitalized in the industry,\u201d said Archer CEO and Founder Adam Goldstein.\n\n\nWith this capital and the expanded manufacturing partnership with Stellantis, Archer is now well-positioned to execute its planned path to reach commercialization of its electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, Midnight. Moelis & Company acted as the sole placement agent for the transaction, providing strategic advice and support throughout the process.\n\n\nThis capital raise announcement follows Archer\u2019s planned network in Los Angeles and its recently announced developments with Southwest Airlines and United Airlines. It also follows major milestones, such as a successful transition flight, certification to begin operating as a commercial airline and the recent delivery of its first aircraft to the United States Air Force.\n\n\n*The key terms of the contract manufacturing relationship with Stellantis is based on an agreement in principle that contemplate the parties to enter into future definitive agreements related thereto\n\n\nAbout Archer\n\nArcher is a leader in the electrification of aviation.

They've been on a tear releasing so many new products and building what clearly is the strongest open source observability platform in the market,\u201d said Gaurav Gupta, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. \u201cSeeing the company exceed 5,000 paying customers and consistently deliver groundbreaking solutions for both open source and enterprise users is a testament to their vision and execution.\u201d\n\n\nGrafana Labs CEO and co-founder Raj Dutt adds, \u201cWe're grateful for the support from new and existing investors reinforcing their commitment to Grafana Labs during an uncertain market \u2013 we see this transaction and valuation as strong third-party validation of not just our trajectory, but also the opportunity at hand. I\u2019m incredibly proud that we have stayed true to our roots over the past decade with open source at the heart of what we do at Grafana Labs, and we are committed to fostering a thriving ecosystem where innovation and collaboration flourish.\u201d\n\n\nGrowth Milestones and Market Recognition\n\nIn August, Grafana Labs was named a Leader in the Gartner\u00ae Magic Quadrant\u2122 for Observability Platforms. The recognition is based on Grafana Cloud\u2019s Completeness of Vision and Ability to Execute. Grafana Cloud, the company\u2019s fully managed, open and composable observability platform, allows organizations to bring together diverse data sources and own their own observability strategies. Over the past year, Grafana Cloud has introduced a range of new solutions that make it faster and easier to get up and running with observability, including application and frontend observability. Customers are saving time, reducing toil, and cutting costs with new AI/ML features such as Adaptive Metrics, which lowers bills by identifying and eliminating unused metrics through aggregation. These enhancements have significantly contributed to its rapid adoption, with Grafana Cloud now growing twice as fast as the self-managed version.\n\n\nWith the observability industry expected to experience significant growth in the coming years due to the increasing adoption of cloud-native technologies, more and more organizations are turning to Grafana Labs to help them manage the growing complexities of their infrastructure. The company has increased the number of paying customers in the past year to over 5,000. Customers span various industries and sectors, including companies like Citigroup, Salesforce, Dell Technologies, ASOS, and Microsoft.\n\n\nNew customer growth has also propelled Grafana Labs well beyond $250 million in ARR. The achievement not only cements Grafana Labs' position as a key player in the industry but also sets a strong foundation for continued growth and innovation in the years to come.\n\n\nGrafana Labs\u2019 product innovation and customer growth helped land the company on Forbes\u2019 2024 Cloud 100 list for the fourth time in a row, in the #23 spot. Published by Forbes in partnership with Bessemer Venture Partners and Salesforce Ventures, the Cloud 100 recognizes the most innovative and valuable private cloud companies based on market leadership, valuation, growth, and culture.\n\n\nGrafana Labs received several other accolades recently, including inclusion on Redpoint's InfraRed 100 list and Silicon Valley Defense Group\u2019s NATSEC100, while Grafana Cloud's \"actually useful\" free tier was named Best Observability Solution in DevOps.com's DevOps Dozen awards and open source Grafana was crowned one of 2024's Coolest Open Source Tools by CRN.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished so much in the almost 10 years since Grafana Labs was established. The open source side project my co-founder Torkel \u00d6degaard created now has 20 million users worldwide and has become the foundation of a sustainable business and market leader in observability,\u201d said Dutt. \u201cBeyond the impressive numbers, what I\u2019m most proud of is that we have stayed true to our roots, while diversifying our revenue sources. We believe with the right strategy, open source will win and we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\n\nGartner Disclaimer\n\nGartner, Magic Quadrant for Observability Platforms, Gregg Siegfried, Matt Crossley, Mrudula Bangera, Padraig Byrne, 12 August 2024\n\n\nGARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally, and MAGIC QUADRANT is a registered trademark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates and are used herein with permission.

        "body": "SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Curebound, a philanthropic organization that raises and invests strategic funding for cancer research, is announcing important updates on its grant recipients. This includes $4.1M in follow-on funding recently obtained by its 2021 oncofertility Discovery Grant recipient to expand clinical trials; an additional $1.2M secured by one of its 2023 Cure Prize recipients to further support and expand clinical trials in pancreatic cancer research; and recognition for one of its 2023 Targeted Grant recipients on its new, transformational Artificial Intelligence (AI) precision-oncology platform.\n\n\n\n\nIn particular:\n\n\n\nCurebound 2021 Discovery Grant recipients H. Irene Su, MD, MSCE, University of California, San Diego, and Paula Aristizabal, MD, MAS, Rady Children\u2019s Hospital, have received $4.1M in follow-on funding to expand clinical trials for their Oncofertility Care Program. The additional funding will allow the program, aimed at preserving fertility for cancer patients, to expand to 19 clinics across three Southern California health systems.\n\n\u201cCurebound funding was critical to expanding our pilot program into an NCI-funded clinical trial, now involving 2800 adolescent and young adult cancer patients at 19 clinics across three southern California health systems. This trial will study how to improve equitable access to oncofertility care for adolescent and young adult cancer patients. UC San Diego has become the referral center for ovarian tissue preserving for young cancer patients throughout southern California. We are now additionally partnered with Kaiser Los Angeles, Kaiser San Diego, and Eisenhower Medical Center for oncofertility care,\u201d said Su.\n\n\n\n\n2023 Cure Prize recipients Shweta Joshi, PhD, and Andrew Lowy, MD, of UC San Diego, have received $1.2M in follow-on funding from The Lustgarten Foundation to further support their clinical trial in pancreatic cancer research and extend the study to multiple sites including University of California Los Angeles and UC San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThis funding allows us to accrue patients, get answers more rapidly, and engage other scientific partners,\u201d said Dr. Lowy. \u201cWe've more than doubled this incredible gift we received from Curebound. Because Curebound believed in us, that belief made an additional organization say it's worth believing in, too. Curebound\u2019s support makes it possible for us to study the effectiveness of this approach in patients and understand the science behind it. As the drug we will use is already FDA approved for other indications, if successful our study could rapidly change the standard of care for pancreatic cancer patients.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNew AI tool from Curebound-funded Ludmil Alexandrov, PhD of UC San Diego, bypasses DNA sequencing, outperforms FDA-approved precision-oncology tests \u2013featured in Journal of Clinical Oncology \u2013 Alexandrov, awarded a 2023 Curebound Targeted Grant  for his work in next-generation sequencing to increase precision and effectiveness of therapy for prostate cancer patients, has made an enormous step forward in a new AI platform designed to save weeks and thousands of dollars from curative first-line precision-therapy workflows, for which his Curebound-funded work was foundational. The AI method in his latest work enables immediate, low-cost detection of clinically-actionable homologous-recombination deficiency from histological slides, the FDA-approved biomarker for treating aggressive ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. A UC San Diego spin-off, created to accelerate translation, will make precision therapy real for other genomic biomarkers and cancers worldwide.\n\nCo-senior author of the study and Curebound-funded researcher, Scott Lippman, MD, said, \"This breakthrough AI technology, applied directly to routine tissue slides, will eliminate delays and health inequities that have confounded the promise of precision oncology, to allow instantaneous, accurate, and fair access to actionable genomic-biomarker detection\u2014required for precision, targeted therapy. There is no question that this approach is the future of precision oncology, as we know it.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cCurebound invests in high-risk/high-reward studies that others might pass on but that we feel have potential to disrupt cancer research,\u201d says Curebound CEO Anne Marbarger. \u201cOur scientific advisory board and research partners identify the most promising research and grant submissions, focusing on the greatest return on our donors\u2019 investments in terms of research and clinical trial advancements, for cancer patients and their families, whom we ultimately serve.\u201d\n\n\nTo date, Curebound has funded 115 cancer research grants for cancer research in San Diego, a leading biopharma hub in the U.S., with the potential to spread nationally through scientific collaborations that accelerate better detection, treatment and cures for cancers.\n\n\nTo learn more, visit www.curebound.org\n\nAbout Curebound:\n\nCurebound is a 501c3 philanthropic organization that raises and invests strategic funding into innovative cancer research among San Diego\u2019s top research institutions. At the core of our mission is a commitment to collaboration. Curebound's unique grantmaking platform fosters cooperation among specialized scientific teams enabling the brightest minds to work together and produce better outcomes for patients. To date, Curebound has awarded more than $35 million for pioneering cancer research, funding 115 grants that explore all different types of adult and pediatric cancer.
