        "body": "Two soldiers were killed and several were injured when an Israeli Air Force helicopter crashed in the southern Gaza Strip early Wednesday, in what the military described as an accident. They were named by the Israel Defense Forces as Sgt. Maj. (res.) Daniel Alloush, 37, from Tel Aviv, and Sgt. Maj. (res.) Tom Ish-Shalom, 38, from Nes Harim. Both served in the IAF\u2019s elite search and rescue Unit 669. According to an initial IAF probe, a UH-60 Black Hawk from the 123rd Squadron flew to Rafah with a Unit 669 medical team on Tuesday night to evacuate a combat engineer seriously wounded in fighting in the area. During the final landing stage inside an Israeli army encampment in Rafah at around 12:30 a.m., the helicopter impacted the ground instead of touching down correctly. According to the probe, the helicopter was not hit by enemy fire, and the crash occurred moments before it was supposed to land, meaning it did not fall from a significant height. The helicopter was still heavily damaged in the crash, and all those aboard it were injured. In all, two soldiers were killed and another eight were taken to hospitals \u2014 including the combat engineer who was injured separately during fighting in Rafah. Among the seriously wounded in the crash were two pilots and a mechanic with the IAF\u2019s 123rd Squadron; and a reservist doctor and another soldier with Unit 669. Additionally, a reservist Unit 669 doctor and another mechanic with the 123rd Squadron were moderately wounded in the crash, the IDF said. The seriously wounded combat engineer, who was supposed to be evacuated by the crashed Black Hawk, served with the 710th Combat Engineering Battalion. It was still unclear what led to the crash, although the IAF described it as an accident. IAF Chief Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar ordered a probe to determine why the helicopter impacted the ground in the encampment instead of landing correctly. Black Hawk helicopters, known in the IAF as the Yanshuf \u2014 Owl in Hebrew \u2014 are used for both routine transportation missions and to drop off and pick up troops during military operations. Amid the war in Gaza, the choppers have been used for medical evacuations from inside the Strip, taking close to 2,000 wounded soldiers to hospitals in Israel. "

        "body": "This Editor\u2019s Note was sent out earlier Wednesday in ToI\u2019s weekly update email to members of the Times of Israel Community. To receive these Editor\u2019s Notes as they\u2019re released, join the ToI Community\u00a0here. After months of his toxic public appearances, scorning his critics as Hamas facilitators and falsely asserting his peerless capacity to save Israel from the ongoing October 7 catastrophe he failed to prevent, you don\u2019t need to listen to much of the conversation between Benjamin Netanyahu and bereaved father Rabbi Elhanan Danino to have reconfirmed, yet again, that the prime minister is beyond salvation and entirely capable of taking Israel down with him. He was actually on his best behavior when confronted with Danino\u2019s anguished pleas for unity, an end to petty politics, and the prioritizing of the divine Jewish value of saving the hostages\u2019 lives. He was trying to empathize when he told the mourning family \u2014 whose 25-year-old Ori was captured on October 7 trying to save his friends at the Supernova festival, abducted to Gaza, held for 11 months in unthinkable conditions, and finally murdered by his Hamas captives \u2014 that he had been injured in a hostage rescue attempt during his army service at age 22 and that he knew what it was like to lose a brother. \u201cNo,\u201d one of Ori\u2019s brothers interjected, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand. You built your career on your brother\u2019s back\u2026 Your brother was a true national hero. Where did that get lost?\u201d \u201cYou people on high have to stop dealing with nonsense and stirring up fights and disagreement,\u201d Rabbi Danino implored him. \u201cWe don\u2019t deserve this land without unity\u2026 Shut down your office for 10 minutes a day and think about where your Jewish values are\u2026\u201d Netanyahu is clinging desperately to a job in which he has failed his country and his people with uniquely disastrous consequences, and is being enabled by 63 lawmakers who are a mixture of cowards, self-interested egotists, anti-Zionist Jewish supremacists and fools. He was unsurprisingly unmoved even by the pleas on behalf of the rest of the hostages by Danino \u2014 an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who had never spoken at a hostage families\u2019 rally, who apparently never even joined the main forum representing the families, and who graciously consented to host Netanyahu at his shiva while other families of the six newly murdered hostages had refused to so much as take the prime minister\u2019s calls. Netanyahu evidently also remains undeflected by the video from the tunnel where the six were held and murdered, produced by the IDF and shown to cabinet ministers on Sunday before it was publicly screened on Tuesday. Along with other ministers in the dismal coterie he has assembled, he apparently is unpersuaded by the security establishment\u2019s insistence that the moment for at least trying hard for a deal is being missed \u2014 and that the tragedy of the six was an almost inevitable consequence of the current stage of the fighting, with Hamas captors, seeing their own deaths approaching, killing hostages and attempting to escape. Tackling a vast Hamas tunnel network in Rafah\u2019s Tel Sultan neighborhood, the IDF rescued hostage Farhan al-Qadi on August 27, and killed three Hamas terrorists fleeing the tunnel complex that day and the next. Danino, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Alexander Lobanov and Carmel Gat were being held some 700 meters away, unbeknown to al-Qadi or to the IDF. On August 29, the six were shot dead in cold blood by their Hamas captors, who then fled. On August 30, the IDF killed two terrorists coming out of the tunnel complex, who it now thinks may have been the murderers of the six. On August 31, the IDF found and entered the tunnel where the six were held and killed, and their bodies were brought back to Israel overnight. The cabinet was shown the tunnel footage on Sunday at the urging of families of the hostages, who hoped that it might prompt the government to push harder for a deal, with the support of the IDF. Presenting the material to the public on Tuesday evening, Hagari said ominously that other hostages are believed to be languishing in similarly dire and potentially deadly conditions. After ministers had watched the film, however, Itamar Ben Gvir, the hard-right national security minister, declared that it showed the IDF must \u201cincrease the military pressure on a large scale, so that Hamas will get down on its knees and beg to return the hostages.\u201d A Channel 12 report claimed that other ministers echoed the sentiment. There are believed to be dozens of October 7 hostages still alive. (In all, 101 hostages are held in Gaza, four of them for the past decade; 35 of them are confirmed to have been abducted dead or to have died in captivity.) The terms of the stalled deal to try to bring home some or all of them are staggeringly problematic for Israel. As I wrote here in May as regards an earlier version of the deal, Hamas has sought an arrangement whereby \u201chundreds of the most dangerous and iconic terror chiefs and murderers, including at least 150 serving life terms\u201d would be released into the West Bank in the very early days of any agreement, in return for female hostages it holds \u2014 in a transparent gambit to set the West Bank alight. The IDF and other security chiefs are adamant that the price is worth paying \u2014 even though these freed prisoners will certainly return to terrorism (as some of those released in November have done) \u2014 and that they can and will be rearrested (as some of those released in November have been). Strikingly, this aspect of the deal was not resisted by Netanyahu in the war cabinet-approved May proposal, and has not been highlighted by the prime minister in his subsequent hardened demands. Perhaps he believes that to oppose the release of hundreds of security prisoners in order to secure the freedom of up to 97 hostages would turn a harsh spotlight on his 2011 decision to release 1,027 security prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, in order to secure the freedom of a single Israeli soldier. By contrast, his recent obsessive focus on the ostensible existential imperative to retain the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border is clearly cynical. He had a decade and a half to retake the corridor if, as he now claims, it is central to Israel\u2019s very future. And yet he didn\u2019t even prioritize sending the IDF there for the first seven months of the war. Now, though, he claims he dare not relinquish control of it for even the first 42 days of a deal. Despite the widening crisis since October 7 \u2014 with no strategic goal and mounting losses of hostages and soldiers in Gaza; Hezbollah firing relentlessly on the north; escalating terrorism in and from the West Bank helped along by Ben Gvir\u2019s Temple Mount Jewish prayer pyromania; Iran closing in on the bomb; and economic, social and psychological meltdown at home \u2014 the notorious 63 steadfastly sustain Netanyahu in power. All of which is why a fresh effort by at least some of the hostages\u2019 families to push a very practical aspect of Rabbi Danino\u2019s plea for unity \u2014 the establishment of a genuine national unity government \u2014 requires serious consideration. Netanyahu is not willingly going anywhere, and his coalition acolytes won\u2019t make him. But maybe a \u201cdeal government\u201d can take shape, genuinely committed to a hostage-ceasefire agreement, that \u201cin the end will also lead to true unity in the nation,\u201d as one hostage relative, Sharon Sharabi, has reportedly put it. Just possibly rescuing the hostages, that is, and just possibly rescuing Israel too. The likes of Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid will not join a coalition that merely adds their dissenting voices to a chorus still dominated by Bezalel Smotrich and Ben Gvir. Gantz\u2019s National Unity party already came to feel it was serving in the fig-leaf role \u2014 from October 2023 to June. But as things stand, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is the lone voice of Zionist sanity in the Israeli leadership, and, if Netanyahu thinks he can get away with firing him a second time, Gallant could be gone soon. It\u2019s worth noting, in this context, that were Netanyahu \u2014 74, with a heart condition, an impossible workload and no formally designated acting PM in his absence \u2014 to fall ill or be otherwise unable to serve, the cabinet would vote in a temporary replacement by simple majority. There\u2019s really no telling who that might be. But Yariv Levin, the man who still wants to destroy our independent judiciary, even after his efforts to do so last year ripped Israel apart and emboldened Hamas and all our other enemies, is in prime position as the sole current deputy prime minister. Explaining his pleas to the prime minister in a subsequent interview, Rabbi Danino said he hoped\u00a0Netanyahu understands that \u201coutside, there is a nation that is waiting for those 101 hostages, to end this terrible thing. That\u2019s what will put this nation back together \u2014 to bring them home, to finish this terrible nightmare.\u201d He said he did not believe he had said anything the premier had not heard before: \u201cI told him what a lot of people think. To my sorrow, I said this as a bereaved father who has lost his firstborn son.\u201d Asked whether he thought he managed to \u201ccrack some kind of wall\u201d in Netanyahu, Danino said he greatly hoped so, \u201cfor the sake of the 101 families and for the people of Israel, who must, must unify and reconnect.\u201d "

        "body": "Welcome to The Times of Israel\u2019s Daily Briefing, your 20-minute audio update on what\u2019s happening in Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish world. Military reporter Emanuel Fabian and political reporter Tal Schneider join host Amanda Borschel-Dan on today\u2019s episode. Late yesterday, the IDF released a video filmed in the tunnel where hostages Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat, and Almog Sarusi were executed by their captors on August 29 before being discovered by the IDF on August 31. Fabian explains what we learned from the video about the hostages\u2019 conditions. An American peace activist who was shot dead in the West Bank last week had \u201cwith high probability\u201d been hit by IDF troops\u2019 mistaken gunfire, the army said Tuesday, expressing regret for the killing. What further steps are being taken? Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told foreign journalists on Monday that Hamas is no longer an organized military force in the Gaza Strip after Israel\u2019s 11-month ongoing military campaign, sparked by the terror group\u2019s October 7 massacre. We hear about Gallant\u2019s assessment of Hamas\u2019s capabilities and the need for the continued suppressing of its guerrilla operations. How does that square with the IDF\u2019s projections for the war against Hamas? On Tuesday, Gallant told troops that the IDF was shifting its focus from Gaza to the northern front and that they should prepare for a ground offensive there. Fabian describes how Gallant delivered this news to a group of soldiers. US Vice President Kamala Harris declared that Israel has the right to defend itself after Hamas\u2019s October 7 massacre, as Republican candidate Donald Trump accused her of \u201chating\u201d the Jewish state. Schneider describes what else the two said about Israel. After the official echelons decided not to pursue a widespread investigation into the failures of October 7 until the war is over, an independent civilian commission of inquiry was launched. Schneider explains who\u2019s involved, how this got off the ground and what we\u2019re hearing so far. For news updates, please check out The Times of Israel\u2019s ongoing live blog.

        "body": "Jordan\u2019s Islamist opposition made significant gains in parliamentary elections, boosted by anger over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, initial official results showed on Wednesday. The Islamist Action Front also benefited from a new electoral law that encourages a bigger role for political parties in the 138-seat parliament, though tribal and pro-government factions will continue to dominate the assembly. The Front, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, won up to a fifth of the seats under the revamped electoral law, which for the first time allocated 41 seats for parties, according to preliminary figures seen by Reuters and confirmed by independent and official sources. \u201cThe Jordanian people have given us their trust by voting for us. This new phase will increase the burden of responsibility for the party towards the nation and our citizens,\u201d Wael al Saqqa, head of the party, told Reuters. Tuesday\u2019s vote represents a modest step in a democratization process launched by King Abdullah II as he seeks to insulate Jordan from the conflicts at its borders, and respond to demands for robust political reforms. Under Jordan\u2019s constitution, most powers still rest with the king, who appoints governments and can dissolve parliament. The assembly can force a cabinet to resign by a vote of no confidence. The voting system still favors sparsely populated tribal and provincial regions over the densely populated cities mostly inhabited by Jordanians of Palestinian descent, which are Islamic strongholds and highly politicized. Turnout among Jordan\u2019s 5.1 million eligible voters in Tuesday\u2019s poll was low at 32.25 percent, initial official figures showed, up slightly from 29% in the last election in 2020. Candidates had expressed worries ahead of the election that the war in Gaza could dampen turnout, hurting chances for more significant gains by Islamists who had sought to capitalize on public anger against Israel. \u201cThe Gaza war and the Palestinian cause occupy a major place in Jordanian elections, as all eyes and minds are on Gaza and Palestine and the massacres taking place there against the Palestinian people,\u201d IAF candidate Saleh Armouti said ahead of the vote. Jordanian officials say the fact that elections are being held at all while the war in Gaza and other regional conflicts are raging demonstrates their country\u2019s relative stability. The Muslim Brotherhood has been allowed to operate in Jordan since 1946. But it fell under suspicion after the Arab Spring, which saw Islamists pitted against established powers in many Arab countries. They have led some of the largest protests in the region in support of the Hamas terror group, their ideological allies, in what their opponents say led to bolstered popularity. Jordan\u2019s top court in 2020 dissolved the country\u2019s branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, citing the group\u2019s failure to \u201crectify its legal status.\u201d "

A Victoria state police spokesperson said in a statement that police were pelted with rocks, horse manure and bottles filled with liquid as they tried to protect attendees of the expo, some of whom were assaulted by protesters. Police said two dozen police officers required medical treatment and 39 people were arrested for offenses including assaulting, obstructing or hindering police, arson and blocking roads. \u201cVictoria police is appalled at the behavior of some of the protesters in attendance,\u201d the police spokesperson said. \u201cIf you wish to come and protest, do so peacefully. We will not tolerate criminal behavior.\u201d \u201cSome police have been spat at by protesters, whilst other officers have been sprayed with a liquid irritant, some of which has been identified as acid.\u201d Protesters, organized by groups including Students for Palestine, Extinction Rebellion and Disrupt Wars, also lit fires in the street and disrupted traffic and public transportation, while objects were thrown at several police horses but no serious injuries were reported, police said. Come down to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre to block entrance to the Land Forces weapons expo, the peak gathering of global war mongers who commit genocide and war crimes with the showcased weapons. The more people here the better pic.twitter.com/TCIHrupPCp \u2014 James Conlan ????\ufe0f\u200d???? (@JamesMConlan) September 10, 2024 Some 1,200 people attended the protest outside the venue hosting the biennial Land Forces International Land Defence Exposition, according to authorities. Australian media reported it was the largest police operation in Melbourne since 2000, when the city hosted the World Economic Forum. Local police, fearing crowds of as many as 25,000 protesters, diverted resources from regional areas in anticipation. About 1,000 exhibiting organizations from 31 countries were expected to attend the event through Friday, which the organizers said was Australia\u2019s largest defense expo. Some attendees were doused in a red liquid by protesters, ABC News reported. Videos posted to social media showed many protesters chanting pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel slogans through loudspeakers and waving Palestinian flags while dumpsters were pushed toward police lines. Dozens of people could also been heard shouting \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\u201d a chant condemned by many as a call for the elimination of Israel. Some held signs calling for an \u201cunconditional ceasefire\u201d in Israel\u2019s war against the Hamas terror group, apparently dismissing the need for the release of the 101 Israeli hostages held by terrorists in Gaza. \u201cWe\u2019re protesting to stand up for all those who have been killed by the type of weapons on display at the convention,\u201d Students for Palestine national co-convenor Jasmine Duff said in a statement. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said people had the right to protest but had to do it in a peaceful manner. \u201cYou don\u2019t say you\u2019re opposed to defense equipment by throwing things at police. They\u2019ve got a job to do and our police officers should be respected at all times,\u201d Albanese told Channel Seven. Antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment have risen in Australia since Hamas\u2019s October 7 massacre, which saw thousands of terrorists burst across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 251 hostages, mostly civilians, amid acts of brutality and sexual assault. In October, a few days after the unprecedented onslaught, Jewish Australians who were holding a vigil outside the Sydney Opera House were faced with antisemitic pro-Palestinian protesters who chanted \u201cF*** the Jews\u201d and \u201cGas the Jews,\u201d although law enforcement later claimed that they were chanting, \u201cWhere\u2019re the Jews\u201d and not \u201cGas the Jews.\u201d In an effort to combat the spike in antisemitism, Albanese appointed an envoy in July to deal with the issue, as well as an envoy to address Islamaphobia.

        "body": "Some families of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip are reportedly mobilizing in support of a unity government, a day after President Isaac Herzog said the \u201cpolitical system must come together with all its might\u201d to bring the abductees home. According to a Channel 12 news report on Tuesday, the family representatives have recently held meetings with lawmakers from the opposition Yesh Atid and National Unity parties, along with members of the coalition\u2019s far-right Otzma Yehudit, ultra-Orthodox Shas, and even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud. The meetings took place amid concern among the families that the government will be expanded for political reasons, the report said, rather than to achieve the goal of freeing the 97 hostages kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 who are still held in Gaza. \u201cDon\u2019t play tricks on us. Don\u2019t set up a fake unity government that will thwart a deal, but rather a \u2018deal government\u2019 that in the end will also lead to true unity in the nation,\u201d Sharon Sharabi, whose brothers Eli and Yossi were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, was quoted as saying in the report. Yossi was confirmed dead by the Israel Defense Forces in January, while Eli is believed to be alive and still held in the Gaza Strip. Also calling for unity on Tuesday, Rabbi Elhanan Danino, whose son Ori Danino was kidnapped on October 7 and executed by Hamas last month, told the crowd at a rally in Tel Aviv\u2019s Hostages Square that the fringes of society must not be allowed to divide the \u201cmostly connected, loving, and united\u201d public. \u201cAll of Israel are brothers. We may wear different clothes, but we all came from the same father and the same mother,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us not allow anyone to divide us.\u201d Danino also shared this sentiment directly with Netanyahu when the premier and his wife Sara visited the family home to pay their respects during the traditional seven-day mourning period. \u201cYou people on high have to stop \u2013 stop! \u2013 dealing with nonsense and stirring up fights and disagreement. Without unity, we don\u2019t deserve this country; there will be no rebuilding without this land,\u201d Danino was heard telling Netanyahu in recordings broadcast from the visit. The bodies of Danino and five other hostages \u2014 Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat, and Almog Sarusi \u2014 who were all kidnapped alive on October 7, were recovered by the IDF from a tunnel in southern Gaza\u2019s Rafah on August 31, a day or two after they were executed. The Channel 12 report also noted assessments that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar views internal division within Israeli society \u2014 such as the mass protests in 2023 over the government\u2019s judicial overhaul and since October 7 over the hostages \u2014 as an advantage for the terror group. The families were not the only ones appearing to rally to Herzog\u2019s call to unity, with Immigration and Absorption Minister Ofir Sofer of the far-right Religious Zionism party saying on Tuesday that due to the challenges posed by the current conflict, \u201cwe will be required to make dramatic decisions for Israel\u201d and asserting that now was \u201cthe time to join forces and know how to act together.\u201d The call also resonated with MK Matan Kahana of the centrist National Unity party, who told the network that \u201cwhat Israel needs now is a broad unity government that relies on the Zionist and moderate forces in Israeli society.\u201d National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir\u2019s Otzma Yehudit party, however, argued that Herzog\u2019s statement was \u201can irresponsible call that collaborates with Hamas propaganda and the blood libel of the extreme left.\u201d Channel 12 reported on Tuesday that Herzog had been holding talks with politicians on both sides of the aisle to push for unity, and quoted a Shas official as stating that \u201cthere is a will and there is support for a unity government.\u201d Opposition Leader Yair Lapid, for his part, has offered to enter the government in place of Netanyahu\u2019s far-right allies to provide a \u201csafety net\u201d to the government by replacing Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich if they leave the government over the hostage deal. It is believed that 97 of the 251 hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 33 confirmed dead by the IDF. Hamas released 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November, and four hostages were released before that. Eight hostages have been rescued by troops alive, and the bodies of 37 hostages have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the military as they tried to escape their captors. Hamas is also holding two Israeli civilians who entered the Strip in 2014 and 2015, as well as the bodies of two IDF soldiers who were killed in 2014. Sam Sokol contributed to this report. "

        "body": "For the last 20 years, Volker Gerling has been creating \u201cthumb cinema\u201d performances of the people he meets during his on-foot treks. \u201cSometimes I tell the story behind the story, sometimes I show the story without telling it,\u201d said Gerling of his performance art, which is called Portraits in Motion. \u201cSometimes that changes it for the audience \u2014 they see the protagonist with different eyes.\u201d When Gerling performs in English at the Israel Festival, on September 18 and 19 at the Jerusalem Theater, he\u2019ll have his usual setup \u2014 a table and screen \u2014 with his photographic flipbooks displayed onscreen as he tells the stories of the people portrayed. \u201cPeople come alive in my hands and we see them onscreen as a form of animation,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an art form that Gerling created in 2003, first working in Germany and then \u2014 following a 2015 performance at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival that brought him new audiences \u2014 around the world. The performances for the Israel Festival, however, mark the first time Gerling has developed a completely new piece in a foreign country for a festival. Gerling had been hoping to participate in the 2024 Israel Festival, but when the October 7 Hamas attack happened, he said, he was shocked \u201cin the face of the monstrous event,\u201d and didn\u2019t expect the festival to take place or that he would be invited if it did. When the invitation came in December, said Gerling, he wanted to come but felt frightened to be suddenly placed in the middle of the conflict. Still, he accepted. Gerling made plans to take his walk through Israel in April, but postponed that trip when Iran threatened to attack. He came instead in May, during the week of Israel\u2019s national days, with a guided tour for him to meet with those directly affected by October 7. \u201cIt was not a walk around Israel,\u201d said Gerling, who hadn\u2019t visited Israel since 1988. \u201cIt was a guided tour for me, and it was a different way of working for me, in a situation that is sad and complicated. I got a very intense view inside Israeli society.\u201d Gerling met a Bedouin father and his sons who had been working in Kibbutz Be\u2019eri when it was attacked and somehow survived, hiding in fear for hours with bullets flying over their heads. And he toured another of the southern kibbutz communities, guided by a survivor who told him about her desperate hours of hiding in a sealed room. While Gerling usually photographs the people he meets to create his flipbooks, he couldn\u2019t do that with several of his interview subjects because of the harsh, loud sounds of his camera, which he uses to take 36 photos of each person or image in a matter of seconds. \u201cIt\u2019s a brutal way of taking photos, again and again, tak, tak, tak, tak,\u201d he said, describing the harsh sound. \u201cI had the feeling that my camera, in this situation, would become a weapon instead of turning their souls to life.\u201d Their stories were also different from those of Gerling\u2019s usual subjects, and the Israeli interviewees had already told their stories many times. \u201cIt makes a big difference if people tell their story for the first time, or if they\u2019re telling it again and again,\u201d said Gerling. \u201cWhen I do my walks in Germany, I photograph very regular people and when they experience a stranger who is interested in their story, then they grow in a way and become proud and use this energy that creates this chance encounter to make my portraits.\u201d It\u2019s that energy that Gerling unloads into his flipbooks, and that becomes apparent in his performances. \u201cWhen I decided to come back to photograph people in July, when people heard that, something happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were expecting me and that moment created an energy, like on my walks. They became excited and proud and didn\u2019t know exactly what to expect.\u201d Nor did Gerling. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a walk in Israel,\u201d said Gerling. \u201cI hope that one day I can do that as well.\u201d Portraits in Motion, September 18 and 19, Jerusalem Theater.

        "body": "A major sticking point in the floundering ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas revolves around control of the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula. Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the case for maintaining an Israeli military presence in this area, calling it a \u201cstrategic imperative\u201d to prevent the Hamas terror group from rearming, as he explained during a press conference. But both Hamas and Egypt have vehemently opposed the possibility of the IDF remaining in the Philadelphi Corridor. While Hamas\u2019s objection is self-evident \u2013 the Philadelphi Corridor is often referred to as the terrorist organization\u2019s \u201cpipeline for oxygen\u201d as it is Gaza\u2019s only contact with the outside world aside from Israel \u2013 Egypt\u2019s resistance has baffled many, since Cairo already shares a long border with Israel that runs for over a hundred miles, south of the Gaza Strip. In a recent interview with The Times of Israel, Egyptian analyst Dalia Ziada viewed Cairo\u2019s stance very critically. \u201cEgyptian negotiators should approach Israel from a point of view of cooperation, rather than applying pressure,\u201d said Ziada, who recently relocated to Washington, DC. \u201cThe national security of our two countries is interdependent,\u201d she added. \u201cIsrael has helped Egypt in the past against Islamist militias in Sinai, and cooperation between the two countries has been very successful in the past. Why doesn\u2019t Egypt do the same with Israel now?\u201d At the same time, Ziada noted that the rhetoric around Hamas has become more positive in official Egyptian media discourse after October 7. Hamas is no longer referred to as a terror organization but as a \u201cresistance group,\u201d even though its gunmen have killed Egyptian soldiers and civilians in Sinai in the past. Ziada saw three reasons for Egypt\u2019s refusal to cooperate with Israel over the controversial corridor: the opposition of Sinai Bedouin tribes, the embarrassment of the Egyptian leadership over its failure to secure its border with Gaza, and the potential backlash from Egyptian society and the Arab world at large. For at least two decades, Bedouin tribes in Sinai have profited from smuggling all sorts of goods, including weapons, to Gaza through tunnels beneath the border. Despite an Egyptian effort in 2015 to flood and close these tunnels in cooperation with Israel, Ziada noted, the tribes and Hamas found ways to resume their operations within two years, thanks to the complacency of corrupt members of Egyptian security forces. Today, \u201cEgypt is careful not to raise outrage among the tribes in Sinai by closing their source of income again, especially under the current economic crisis,\u201d Ziada said. In recent months, after the IDF took control of the Philadelphi Corridor, it has uncovered dozens of tunnels crossing into Egypt, including one large enough for vehicles to drive through. Ziada believes Egyptian security authorities are embarrassed to admit that there were corrupt officials in their midst who allowed the tribes to reopen tunnels with Gaza. \u201cAll the official statements coming out of Egypt are insisting that tunnels do not exist, despite the very clear footage that the IDF has shown of the tunnels,\u201d Ziada said. \u201cTheir discovery is proof that the Egyptian army has failed in doing its primary job of securing the borders and protecting Egypt\u2019s national security. Now [they are confronted with the possibility that] the Israelis are going to play this role and protect the border instead,\u201d Ziada said. Acquiescing to Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor would negatively impact the image of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, both within Egypt and across the Arab world, where support for Hamas and the Palestinian cause is widespread, said Ziada. \u201cIt will make him appear complicit with the Israeli government,\u201d Ziada explained. \u201cThe narrative presented in the Arab media is not that Israel wants to control the Philadelphi Corridor to prevent weapons smuggling to Hamas and avert another October 7 attack. It is that Israel wants to further suffocate the people of Gaza,\u201d she added. A potential embarrassment for el-Sissi would be highly inopportune at a time when the country is mired in a deep economic crisis. Public discontent has been mounting following years of economic mismanagement, the coronavirus pandemic and the fallout of the wars in Europe and the Middle East, not only in Gaza but also in neighboring Sudan and Libya. Egypt has been struggling to revive the lucrative tourism sector decimated by years of turmoil, and attacks by Yemen\u2019s Houthis on shipping routes in the Red Sea have slashed Suez Canal revenues. In addition, a Western-backed reform program adopted in 2016 has caused prices to soar due to austerity measures. Nearly 30 percent of Egyptians currently live in poverty, according to official figures. Egyptian citizens have endured frequent power outages over the summer months, a recurrent problem in the populous North African country that leaves people without air conditioning in the unforgiving summer heat. Meanwhile, videos have gone viral of citizens filming themselves from the fully lit New Administrative Capital under construction outside Cairo. \u062a\u0635\u0628\u062d\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u062e\u064a\u0631 \u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0634\u0639\u0628 \u0648\u0627\u062c\u062f\u0639 \u0634\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0633\u064a\u0628\u0643\u0645 \u0645\u0639 \u0635\u0648\u062a \u0643\u0644\u0643\u0645 \u0628\u062a\u062d\u0628\u0648\u0647 \u0627\u062f\u0639\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u062f\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0644 \u0631\u0628\u0646\u0627 \u064a\u0641\u0631\u062c \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u064a\u0641\u0643 \u0643\u0631\u0628\u0647\u0645 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0649 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0635\u0648\u062a \u0645\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0642\u0627\u062a #\u0648\u0635\u0644_\u0635\u0648\u062a\u0643#\u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629_\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0629_\u0661\u0663_\u0669 #\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629_\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0642 #\u0642\u064a\u0627\u0633_\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0647\u0632\u064a\u0629_15_9 #\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0642_\u0647\u062a\u0634\u064a\u0644_\u0627\u0644\u0636\u0644\u0645\u0629 pic.twitter.com/TjjnXHYHON \u2014 ????\u062d\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0635\u0648\u062a\u0643???? (@Wasal_Sotak2) September 9, 2024 Appeals for demonstrations have gone unanswered, however, as citizens fear repression. Amnesty International reported in July that over the span of three weeks, over 100 people were arbitrarily detained over calls for anti-government protests. Maintaining a strong stance in opposition to Israel appears to be a way for the government to deflect public anger, Ziada said. \u201cGaza and the Palestinian cause are a golden opportunity for the Egyptian leadership to cover its domestic failures in the economy,\u201d Ziada said. \u201cThey have greatly exaggerated their reaction to what is happening in order to direct public outrage towards Gaza. They don\u2019t want to face double public outrage.\u201d Ziada, an outspoken human rights activist and the former director of a think tank that promotes liberal democracy, paid a heavy price for publicly condemning Hamas in her home country. In the immediate aftermath of the October 7 savagery, Ziada did not mince words to criticize Hamas and those who supported it and justified its actions, calling them \u201ca partner in their crime.\u201d Whoever supports #Hamas or justifies their acts of terrorism is a partner in their crime against the people of #Israel. ????

The backlash was immediate. Complaints were filed with Egyptian prosecutors demanding she be put on trial as a spy for Israel and for inciting war crimes, and she received death threats. She was forced to flee and go into exile in the US in November, a decision that she described as \u201cemotionally extremely, extremely difficult. It\u2019s like getting out of your skin.

It\u2019s very similar, for example, to the conflict in Cyprus. Two peoples want to divide a certain piece of land.\u201d However, over time, two layers were added to the core: a regional conflict between Israel and the Arab world, and, starting from the 1980s, a religious dimension that viewed the conflict as between Islam and Judaism. Ziada maintains that after the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel and four Arab countries in 2020, a historic shift has happened with regard to the different dimensions of the dispute. \u201cThe Abraham Accords showed that Arabs and Israelis can be good neighbors and good friends regardless of what happens in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They dissolved the layer of the Arab-Israeli conflict,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are only two layers left. The Israeli-Palestinian dispute over land, which is very small in my opinion, and the bigger and more complex Islamic-Jewish conflict.\u201d \u201cThe latter, unfortunately, has been fueled by Al Jazeera and Islamists. But what we are living right now is not an Arab-Israeli conflict anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s Iran versus Israel. Iran is merely using Arabs as its pawns against Israel.\u201d Agencies contributed to this report. "

        "body": "US Vice President Kamala Harris asserted that Israel has the right to defend itself after Hamas\u2019s October 7 massacre, as Republican candidate Donald Trump accused her of \u201chating\u201d the Jewish state, during a bitter televised debate Tuesday that poured fuel on an already explosive US presidential election. When asked by the moderators how she would secure a hostage-ceasefire deal and about her remarks from months ago that \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself, but it matters how,\u201d Harris started by explaining how the almost year-long war in Gaza was triggered. \u201cLet\u2019s understand how we got here. On October 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, slaughtered 1,200 Israelis, many of them young people who were simply attending a concert where women were horribly raped. And so, absolutely\u2026 Israel has a right to defend itself; we would,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd how it does so matters, because it is also true that far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end, it must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal and we need the hostages out. So we will continue to work around the clock on that.\u201d The Democratic candidate then insisted, \u201cWe must chart a course for a two-solution,\u201d which she said should ensure security for Israelis and \u201cin equal measure\u201d for Palestinians. \u201cThe one thing I will assure you always: I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution, where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve,\u201d she added. Donald Trump: \"She hates Israel.\" ABC's Linsey Davis to the rescue!: \"VP Harris, he says you hate Israel.\" Kamala: He's trying to divide and distract from the reality that he is weak and wrong on national security. He wants to be a dictator! pic.twitter.com/iCGts6OdMq \u2014 Media Research Center (@theMRC) September 11, 2024 For his part, asked how he would \u201cnegotiate with [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and also Hamas to get the hostages out and prevent the killing of more innocent civilians in Gaza,\u201d Trump repeated his assertion that the war would have never started if he was president, before claiming that Harris \u201chates Israel.\u201d \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers\u2026 She hates Israel. If she is president I believe Israel will not exist within two years from now,\u201d he claimed. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty good at predictions, but I hope I\u2019m wrong on that one.\u201d Though the vice president typically presides over such joint addresses as the one Netanyahu made in Washington in July, Harris was speaking at an event in Indiana for Zeta Phi Beta, a historically Black sorority founded at her alma mater, Howard University, and did not attend. \u201cAt the same time, in her own way, she hates the Arab population, because the whole place is going to get blown up: Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone,\u201d Trump went on. \u201cIt would have never happened. Iran was broke under Donald Trump\u2026 Iran had no money for Hamas, or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror\u2026 horrible terror\u2026 they were broke.\u201d \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening with the Houthis in Yemen. Look at what\u2019s going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened. I will get that settled and fast.\u201d The Yemen-based Houthis are part of Iran\u2019s \u201caxis of resistance,\u201d a group of terror groups and militias in the Middle East aligned against Israel and the US that also includes Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Syrian and Iraqi militant groups. Asked to respond to Trump\u2019s claim that she hates Israel, Harris said, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely not true,\u201d describing herself as a lifelong supporter of the Jewish state. The only mention of antisemitism in the debate was a brief remark by Harris about the violence that erupted during the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, which saw white nationalists chanting \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d surrounding counter-protesters and throwing tiki torches at them. \u201cLet\u2019s remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing antisemitic hate \u2014 and what did the president then at the time say? There were fine people on each side,\u201d she said of Trump, after also accusing him of inciting \u201ca violent mob to attack our nation\u2019s Capitol, to desecrate our nation\u2019s Capitol\u201d on January 6, 2021, after he lost the 2020 presidential elections to Joe Biden. One of the most jarring exchanges in the debate was on Trump\u2019s unprecedented refusal to accept his loss to Biden in the 2020 election, before trying to overturn the result. In front of an audience expected to run into the tens of millions of voters, Trump doubled down, insisting there is \u201cso much proof\u201d that he really won. Harris turned to Trump and said that his own former security officials in the White House have called him a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d \u201cWorld leaders are laughing at Donald Trump,\u201d she said. Trump would \u201cgive up\u201d Ukraine to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, \u201ca dictator who would eat you for lunch,\u201d she charged. \u201cDictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again.\u201d The ABC News debate began with Harris unexpectedly approaching Trump to shake his hand before they took to their lecterns at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Within minutes, the 78-year-old Trump called her a \u201cMarxist\u201d and falsely claimed that she and Biden had allowed \u201cmillions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums.\u201d Harris pointed out that Trump is a convicted felon, called him \u201cextreme\u201d and said it is \u201ca tragedy\u201d that throughout his career he had used \u201crace to divide the American people.\u201d Another intense exchange was on abortion. Trump insisted that while having pushed for the end of the federal right to abortion, he wanted individual states to make their own policy. Harris said he was telling a \u201cbunch of lies\u201d and called his policies \u201cinsulting to the women of America.\u201d The last presidential debate in June doomed Biden\u2019s reelection campaign after he delivered a catastrophic performance against Trump. Harris took over as nominee amid Democratic fears that Biden was too old and infirm to defeat the scandal-plagued Republican. Harris has earned a reputation in past debates and while serving as a US senator for ice-cold put-downs and tough questions. Her five days of intensive preparation appeared to pay off against Trump, perhaps the most brutal public speaker in American politics. Trump has long defied political gravity by seeming invulnerable to usual attacks. He has been convicted of falsifying business records to cover up an affair with an adult film star, found liable for sexual abuse, and faces trial on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election. But Harris clearly needled him on one of his favorite, if less serious topics \u2014 his trademark rallies.\u00a0Attendees, she said, prompting an angry retort, were leaving early out of \u201cexhaustion and boredom.\u201d Shortly after the debate ended, meanwhile, Taylor Swift, one of the music industry\u2019s biggest stars, endorsed Harris for US president. \u201cI think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,\u201d Swift wrote in an Instagram post, which included a link to a voter registration website. Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales. In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes. Swift wrote that her endorsement was partially prompted by Trump\u2019s decision to post AI-generated pictures suggesting that she had endorsed him. One showed Swift dressed as Uncle Sam, and the text said \u201cTaylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.\u201d Trump\u2019s posts \u201cbrought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,\u201d Swift wrote, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve done my research, and I\u2019ve made my choice.\u201d Swift is a popular figure nationwide, but especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55 percent of voters overall, including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favorable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favorable opinion and 45% an unfavorable one. With only 56 days left before the election, the intense spotlight was a rare opportunity for both candidates to shift the balance in what polls show is an almost evenly split contest. And the debate was a key chance for Harris to introduce herself to more voters after only jumping into the race less than eight weeks ago, when 81-year-old Biden abruptly quit. "

        "body": "Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican rival Donald Trump went head-to-head in Philadelphia on Tuesday at a high-stakes debate hosted by ABC News. The debate began with Harris unexpectedly approaching Trump to shake his hand before they took to their lecterns at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The niceties ended there. Reuters examined 12 claims made by Harris and Trump. Harris said economists project that Trump\u2019s tariff proposals would cost middle-class families about $4,000 more per year. What we know Trump has pledged tariffs of up to 20 percent on all imports and up to 60% on Chinese goods. Estimates vary on the impact of such tariffs on customers and the \u201calmost $4,000\u201d figure is consistent with the high end of some calculations available but is above others. Tariffs are taxes on imports paid by US importers who often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers by raising their prices. The Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think tank, estimated that middle-income families could face a $3,900 tax increase with Trump\u2019s proposal of 20% tariffs on most imports and 60% levies on Chinese goods. Conservative think tank the American Action Forum also calculated an increase of up to $3,900 in costs if a 60% tariff on items from China is levied. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris shared their takes on the trade disputes between the US and China during the debate. Trump said higher tariffs would not mean higher prices for US consumers, while Harris said the Trump administration \"sold us out\" to China https://t.co/zI8zRWWfXC pic.twitter.com/kzPdfigGAv \u2014 Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) September 11, 2024 Other nonpartisan organizations have estimated lower increases for middle-income households if the tariffs were implemented. Sixteen Nobel laureates have described Trump\u2019s economic plan as something that would increase inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. What we know This is mostly true. Sixteen Nobel prize-winning economists raised concerns in June, warning that the US economy would suffer if Trump won the election in November. The jointly signed letter, first reported by Axios, says the economic agenda of US President Joe Biden is \u201cvastly superior\u201d to Trump\u2019s. The letter was released before Biden stepped aside from the presidential race in late July. \u201cMany Americans are concerned about inflation, which has come down remarkably fast. There is rightly a worry that Donald Trump will reignite this inflation, with his fiscally irresponsible budgets,\u201d the economists state in their letter. The letter did not explicitly say Trump\u2019s plan would invite a recession but said it would have a negative impact on the country\u2019s economic global standing and a \u201cdestabilizing effect\u201d on the domestic economy. Harris said a Trump administration would lead to a \u201cnational abortion ban\u201d and a national \u201cmonitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages.\u201d Trump replied: \u201cI\u2019m not in favor of an abortion ban.\u201d What we know This can\u2019t be predicted and Trump has sent mixed signals on his abortion policy plans. In March, he signaled support for a 15-week national ban on abortion with exceptions for rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother because \u201cyou have to win elections.\u201d He repeated the exceptions during Tuesday\u2019s debate. Before the debate, however, he has said abortion should be left up to the states. In a late August interview, Trump did not respond on whether he would veto a national abortion ban. This came just days after his running mate JD Vance said Trump would veto the ban if Congress passed it. Trump also said in August that he would not enforce the Comstock Act to block mailing of the pill mifepristone, which is used in more than 60% of US abortions. The \u201cno\u201d on the act was less than definitive because shortly after he added: \u201cWe will be discussing specifics of it.\u201d Experts have warned that the 19th-century law could be used to stop abortion nationwide. The prospect of the government monitoring miscarriages came from Project 2025, a set of conservative policy proposals its authors hope Trump will adopt if elected. The Harris campaign has accused Trump of being tied to Project 2025, which was prepared by some of the former president\u2019s closest policy advisers. Trump has disavowed the plan. Project 2025 published a 900-page proposal of recommendations that include restricting abortion rights and the removal of the terms \u201creproductive health\u201d and \u201creproductive rights\u201d from government documents \u2013 but it does not explicitly recommend the government collect menstrual cycle data. Harris cited Trump as saying, \u201cThere will be a bloodbath\u201d if the outcome of this election is not to his liking. What we know This is true. Trump warned of a \u201cbloodbath\u201d while discussing the need to protect the US auto industry from overseas competition during a March 2024 speech in Dayton, Ohio: \u201cIf I don\u2019t get elected, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for the whole\u2026 country.\u201d The Trump campaign and allies later said that when he used the term, he was referring to the auto industry, which Trump said was threatened by the Biden administration over its promotion of electric vehicles. Harris said Trump negotiated directly with the Taliban, got 5,000 Taliban terrorists released and invited the Taliban to Camp David. What we know Harris\u2019s statements are accurate. In 2020, Trump said he would be personally meeting leaders of the Taliban to pave the way for a troop withdrawal deal. That year he also said he spoke on the phone directly to a Taliban leader. Under Trump\u2019s administration, by 2020 the US-backed Afghan government had released 5,000 Taliban prisoners. The release was a condition for the insurgent group to join peace talks with the Afghan government. In 2019, Trump called off plans to invite Taliban leaders to a presidential compound in Camp David, Maryland. Harris said, \u201cThe former president has said that climate change is a hoax.\u201d What we know This is true. Trump has repeatedly said that climate change is a hoax. In November 2012, Trump wrote on Twitter, now X, that \u201cthe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d Later, in January 2014, he said on the platform: \u201cSnowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\u201d During a Campaign rally in South Carolina in December 2015, he said: \u201cObama\u2019s talking about all of this with the global warming and\u2026 a lot of it\u2019s a hoax. It\u2019s a hoax. I mean, it\u2019s a money-making industry, okay? It\u2019s a hoax, a lot of it.\u201d Under Trump\u2019s administration, the United States exited the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the rise in the average global surface temperature. In 2017, Trump argued the pact undermined the US economy. Trump said 21 million people have poured into the US during the Biden administration. What we know It\u2019s not clear what Trump meant when he said 21 million people have poured into the US. He has previously used a 15 million or 20 million figure when speaking about people entering the country illegally. While it is true that the number of encounters reported by US Customs and Border Protection reached record levels at the US-Mexico border during the Biden administration, it isn\u2019t 21 million. CBP data compiled between January 2021 and July 2024 shows 8,297,036 encounters at the southwest land border. When considering nationwide encounters, CBP registered 10,249,626 encounters between January 2021 and July 2024. Encounter figures include data apprehensions under Title 8 and \u201cinadmissibles.\u201d This policy grants some migrants the chance to seek asylum in the US or be processed for deportation. Between March 2020 and May 2023, encounters also included expulsions under the now-expired Title 42, a COVID-era restriction that allowed border agents to quickly expel migrants without being able to seek asylum. Under Title 42, many individual migrants who were rapidly expelled across the border to Mexico tried to cross again or multiple times, increasing the number of encounters counted by border authorities. These figures do not account for \u201cgot aways,\u201d people who are never apprehended by CBP. Although the actual number in this category is unknown, available US government estimates are not close to 21 million. Available estimates for \u201cgot aways\u201d reported by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 are at more than 600,000 and 391,316, respectively. In Springfield, Ohio, immigrants are \u201ceating the cats, they\u2019re eating the pets.\u201d What we know Trump is referring to unsubstantiated claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. There is no evidence that Haitian immigrants killed and ate pets in the town. Posts online on Monday and Tuesday shared videos purporting to support the allegations alongside claims that the Biden-Harris administration is to blame for allowing Haitian immigrants into the country. In a statement on Tuesday, a Springfield police spokesperson said, \u201cIn response to recent rumors alleging criminal activity by the immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.\u201d \u201cI got more votes than any Republican in history by far. In fact, I got more votes than any sitting president in history by far,\u201d Trump said. What we know This is true. Trump received 74.2 million votes in the 2020 presidential election, surpassing former US president Barack Obama\u2019s record number of votes (65.9 million in 2012) for an incumbent candidate. In 2020, more votes were cast for both Biden and Trump than for any other previous candidate in US history. They received 81,283,786 votes (51.3 percent) and 74,222,552 votes (46.8%), respectively, according to data by Edison Research reported by Reuters. According to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, more than 159 million Americans cast their ballot in the 2020 presidential elections, marking the largest voter turnout in the country\u2019s history. Trump said Harris \u201cwas the border czar, remember that. She was the border czar.\u201d What we know This is missing context. \u201cBorder czar\u201d was never an official title and Harris was never strictly overseeing the southern border. Biden indeed asked Harris to lead diplomatic efforts to tackle the \u201croot cause\u201d of illegal immigration. Her portfolio, however, was focused on the drivers of migration from Central America and not enforcement at the border. On the topic of abortion, Trump said that the former governor of Virginia \u201csaid we put the baby aside and then we determine what we want to do with the baby.\u201d What we know This is misleading. Minutes before, Trump had mentioned \u201cexecuting\u201d babies after birth, which is likely a reference to claims that former Virginia governor Ralph Northam advocated for the legalization of infanticide in remarks in 2019 to a local radio station while discussing a bill (HB 2491) aimed at easing certain restrictions on abortions. The bill did not pass. After confusion about Northam\u2019s interview comments, a spokesperson for the then-governor told Vox that Northam had \u201cabsolutely not\u201d been referring to infanticide and instead was discussing the \u201ctragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor.\u201d Trump says that during his administration, \u201cfor 18 months we had nobody killed\u201d in Afghanistan. What we know This is false. Reuters Fact Check previously addressed Trump saying there were no military deaths in 18 months under his administration. While it is unclear which 18 months Trump is referring to, the Defense Casualty Analysis System for Operation Freedom\u2019s Sentinel database recorded US military deaths in Afghanistan each year since 2015 (except for 2022) and found there were casualties for each year of Trump\u2019s administration. The database shows there were 14 total deaths in 2017, 15 total deaths in 2018, 23 total deaths in 2019 and 11 total deaths in 2020. "

        "body": "Iranian cyberattacks on Israel have surged in the wake of the October 7 onslaught by the Iran-backed terror group Hamas, and as the Israel-Hamas war continues to rage, cybersecurity analysts warn these digital incursions will continue regardless of any ceasefire or de-escalation in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, with Israel-Hamas negotiations stalled, Tehran\u2019s hackers, backed by the regime, are further honing their capabilities in what experts say could become a forever war in cyberspace. Despite efforts to tamp down the flames of war, experts told The Times of Israel, any calming of hostilities will not stop digital conflict between the two nations. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Iran] is going to be happy with Israel, even in the case of a ceasefire or some sort of improvement in conditions\u201d in Gaza, said Ben Read, who heads cyberespionage analysis at Mandiant, a Google-owned cybersecurity firm. Iran\u2019s cyber capabilities have become a key element of its broader strategy to defend national interests, deter Western intelligence, and engage in espionage, said John Fokker, who leads threat intelligence at cybersecurity company Trellix. Under the auspices of a branch of the armed forces and a government ministry, Iran has steadily expanded its offensive cyber programs, he said. Since the Hamas-led October 7 massacre took 1,200 lives in Israel and saw 251 people kidnapped to the Gaza Strip, Iranian operatives and cybercrime groups aligned with the Khamenei regime have escalated their cyberattacks on Israeli government and private sector infrastructure. In retaliation, suspected Israeli-aligned hackers have launched their own cyber offensives, targeting Iranian critical infrastructure, including gas stations. Iran\u2019s cyberwarfare capabilities have long been in development. In 2012, its \u201cShamoon\u201d virus crippled 30,000 computers at Saudi Aramco in one of Iran\u2019s most notorious attacks. More recently, in 2020, its hackers targeted Gilead Sciences to steal COVID vaccine research. In 2019, the regime\u2019s cyber operatives carried out a wave of attacks on American cities and airports, highlighting the regime\u2019s ability to disrupt critical infrastructure, Fokker noted. \u201cThese incidents reflect the rapid advancement of Iran\u2019s cyber capabilities, making it a significant threat,\u201d Fokker told The Times of Israel. Now, amid the Gaza conflict, Iranian hackers have targeted Israeli assets more aggressively. In November, the Iran-linked \u201cCyber Av3ngers\u201d hacking group claimed responsibility for breaching industrial water treatment equipment in America. Tehran is in the global public eye again for cyberwarfare after the US intelligence community said its hackers targeted the Donald Trump and Kamala Harris presidential campaigns. James Shires, a technology and global affairs expert who co-directs the European Cyber Conflict Research Initiative, said much of Tehran\u2019s work has been centered on influence operations. Iran\u2019s state-sponsored actors have been amplifying propaganda, spreading disinformation and manipulating social media narratives as part of their broader cyber strategy, Shires said. The war itself has hinged heavily on perception and reputation, Shires said, stressing the importance of online perception battles in modern conflicts. It\u2019s a two-sided game, though. Israel ran its own secret influence campaign targeting US lawmakers, according to a June report from The New York Times that cited officials involved in the effort and documents tied to the operation. \u201cAnything that can change that perception is massively valuable for both sides,\u201d Shires told The Times of Israel. Iranian spin doctors have also embraced artificial intelligence tools to spread disinformation. One AI-driven covert campaign produced fake news websites aimed at influencing American voters, though, according to OpenAI, the effort failed to gain significant engagement. Three government-linked cyber entities have been driving Tehran\u2019s cyber efforts, according to Read at Mandiant. These advanced persistent threat (APT) groups \u2014 APT33, APT34 and APT42 \u2014 operate with sophisticated tactics. APT33 and APT42, for example, are linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and have been targeting Israeli military officials and individuals involved in American presidential campaigns. In the past six months alone, the US and Israel accounted for around 60 percent of APT42\u2019s known targets, according to Google threat intelligence findings. APT34, meanwhile, is likely tied to Iran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, and has been found conducting espionage campaigns against African and Saudi Arabian targets. It\u2019s also previously compromised Israeli companies, including a human resources website. Despite the technical prowess of these groups, experts say Iran\u2019s cyber capabilities fall short of those of cyber titans such as Russia and China. However, the attacks can still be disruptive. \u201cThey can\u2019t necessarily shut down power to the White House,\u201d Read said, \u201cbut if they want to get into a US business, that\u2019s well within their capabilities.\u201d Read described much of Iran\u2019s recent activity as targeting \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d including universities and businesses, rather than sensitive defense assets. Iran\u2019s cyber influence extends beyond its borders, with proxy groups like the Lebanon-based terror group Hezbollah also engaging in cyberattacks. In November, Hezbollah-linked hackers breached Ziv Medical Center in the northern Israeli city of Safed. Meanwhile, Iranian-backed Houthi groups in Yemen have deployed phone spyware against targets across the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey, according to mobile cybersecurity company Lookout. A ceasefire or any reduction in fighting between Israel and Hamas wouldn\u2019t slow the tempo of Iran\u2019s cyber buildup, Shires said, underscoring the ongoing threat that Iran poses in cyberspace. But he stressed that if a positive diplomatic outcome isn\u2019t reached soon, then a miscalculated cyberattack from either side could skyrocket tensions even further. \u201cThat could very quickly be read into this tit-for-tat escalation\u2026 where each side is trying to calibrate very carefully what is appropriate and proportionate to respond, while also not going too far,\u201d he said. Iran\u2019s lesson after October 7 is clear: Cyberspace is not just a battleground for war, but a powerful medium for influence operations and intelligence gathering. And it is just getting started. \u201cThe cyber stuff seems to be a way for Iran to both impact Israel and be seen impacting Israel that does not incur a significant escalation,\u201d Read said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it changing.\u201d "

        "body": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Palestinians took a seat among member states at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, a new right accorded to the Palestinian Authority\u2019s delegation despite it not being a full member of the body. In May, an overwhelming majority of the General Assembly asserted that Palestinians deserved full membership, a move that has been blocked by the United States, which along with Israel says recognition of Palestinian statehood must come through a peace agreement. The General Assembly granted the delegation certain new rights in a resolution, which still excludes it from being able to vote or be a member of the Security Council. Starting with the 79th General Assembly session, which began Tuesday, the Palestinians can submit proposals and amendments, and sit among member states. The Palestinian Authority\u2019s envoy to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, took his place on Tuesday afternoon at a table marked \u201cState of Palestine\u201d between Sri Lanka and Sudan. \u201cThis is not merely a procedural matter. This is a historic moment for us,\u201d said Egyptian Ambassador Osama Mahmoud Abdelkhalek Mahmoud. Just as during the resolution\u2019s adoption, Israel denounced the move. \u201cAny decision and or action that improves the status of the Palestinians, either in the UN General Assembly or bilaterally, is currently a reward\u2026 for terrorism in general and the Hamas terrorists in particular,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, deputy Israel ambassador to the United Nations. In April, amid the war in Gaza started by Hamas\u2019s October 7 terror onslaught in southern Israel, the Palestinians \u2014 who have had \u201cnon-member observer state\u201d status since 2012 \u2014 relaunched a full membership bid. Full membership would not only need a vote by the General Assembly but would also require a Security Council recommendation. The United States, Israel\u2019s staunch ally, vetoed a Security Council recommendation on the matter on April 18. "

        "body": "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 Canada has suspended some 30 permits for arms shipments to Israel, including a rare move against a US company\u2019s Canadian subsidiary\u2019s deal with the US government, the foreign minister said Tuesday. All of the export permits had been approved prior to a January ban on new sales of weapons that could be used in Gaza, which is facing a mounting humanitarian crisis amid the ongoing war started by the Hamas-led October 7 terror atrocities in southern Israel. Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said she had ordered a review of all Canadian weapons suppliers\u2019 contracts with Israel and other countries. \u201cFollowing that, I suspended this summer around 30 existing permits of Canadian companies,\u201d she said. A key ally of the United States, which provides Israel with billions of dollars a year in military aid, Canada drew the ire of Israeli leaders when it initially announced it would halt new arms shipments to Israel as of January 8. Pro-Palestinian protests against Israel across Canada \u2014 at universities, political events and even the Toronto International Film Festival last week \u2014 have continued to put pressure on the government to go further. \u201cOur policy is clear: We will not have any form of arms or parts of arms be sent to Gaza. Period,\u201d Joly said. \u201cHow they\u2019re being sent and where they\u2019re being sent is irrelevant,\u201d she continued, alluding to ammunition that was meant to have been produced by a Canadian division of US defense contractor General Dynamics for the Israel Defense Forces. Joly added that the government is in contact about this issue with General Dynamics. The topic of arms deliveries to Israel has triggered legal proceedings in several countries around the world. Israel has historically been a top receiver of Canadian arms exports, with Can$21 million worth of military material exported to Israel in 2022, according to government data, following Can$26 million in shipments in 2021. That placed Israel among the top 10 recipients of Canadian arms exports. Britain last week also said it would suspend some arms exports to Israel, asserting a \u201cclear risk\u201d that they could be used in a serious breach of international humanitarian law, a move that was strongly denounced by Israeli leaders. Times of Israel staff contributed to this report. "

        "body": "The Times of Israel is liveblogging Wednesday\u2019s events as they happen. An Israeli man was wounded in an anti-tank guided missile attack from Lebanon earlier today. The 39-year-old was taken to Rambam Hospital in Haifa after being hit by a missile in the Kibbutz Dan area. The medical center says he is conscious and suffering shrapnel injuries. Meanwhile, a barrage of some 30 rockets was fired from Lebanon at the Western Galilee, impacting open areas near the community of Abirim, the IDF says. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees says that nearly 530,000 children had now received the polio vaccine across the Gaza Strip. UNRWA says its vaccination campaign is ongoing in north Gaza. US Vice President Kamala Harris says the death of activist Aysenur Eygi was \u201ca horrific tragedy that never should have happened.\u201d Eygi, an American peace activist, was shot dead in the West Bank last week. Yesterday, the army said she had \u201cwith high probability\u201d been accidentally hit by IDF troops\u2019 gunfire. The IDF expressed regret for the killing. Harris\u2019s comments come after US President Joe Biden said he was outraged by her death. \u201cAysenur was peacefully protesting in the West Bank\u2014standing up against the expansion of settlements\u2014when her young life was senselessly cut short. No one should be killed for participating in a peaceful protest,\u201d Harris says. \u201cThe shooting that led to her death is unacceptable and raises legitimate questions about the conduct of IDF personnel in the West Bank. Israel must do more to ensure that incidents like this never happen again,\u201d say the Democrat nominee. \u201cThe United States will continue to hold accountable anyone in the West Bank \u2013 Israelis and Palestinians \u2013 who stokes violence and undermines peace and stability,\u201d she says, calling for full accountability. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Jordan Valley earlier today, his office announces after deadly terrorist attack earlier this week. Three Israeli men were killed in a terrorist shooting attack at the Allenby Bridge Crossing between Jordan and the West Bank on Sunday morning. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told his US counterpart Antony Blinken in August that the UK would reconsider its restrictions on weapons sales licenses to Israel if two conditions are met, Politico reports. The first is a ceasefire in Gaza, and the second is for human rights organizations to be granted access to Palestinians in Israeli prisons, two US officials tell Politico. The call was held on August 20, and the two diplomats met yesterday in London. The US has privately warned Britain against suspending some arms sales to Israel, amid concerns it could damage attempts to broker a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Gaza war against Hamas, a senior British government source told UK\u2019s The Times newspaper last week. Lammy announced earlier this month that 30 out of 350 arms export licenses were being suspended amid concerns the equipment could be used for human rights violations in Gaza, while insisting it was not a blanket embargo. Numerous fires are burning in olive groves east of the village of Burin belonging to a Palestinian farmer, after allegedly being set by settlers from surrounding settlements and illegal outposts. According to the farmer, Bashar Eid, the fires were set by settlers from the Givat Ronen outpost east of Burin in the northern West Bank, and are not currently being tackled by the fire service. A spokesperson for the Judea and Samaria District Fire Service says the details and location of the fires provided by Eid have been passed to the district control center. Fires were also set west of Burin earlier in the day between the Palestinian town and the settlement of Yitzhar, well known for its radicalism. The fire service spokesperson says that four teams are currently tackling those fires. A spokesperson for the Israel Police Samaria District says the police are \u201cunaware\u201d of the alleged arson incidents. The IDF did not immediately respond to requests for comment. [1] At around 6 am this morning, five masked settlers equipped with saws arrived from the direction of the Yitzhar Yeshiva (the buildings under renovation) to an olive grove owned by a Palestinian farmer from Burin, where they cut down and burned dozens of trees. >> pic.twitter.com/BYygRdivKJ \u2014 Yesh Din English (@Yesh_Din) September 11, 2024 Iran\u2019s foreign minister says that Tehran has not delivered any ballistic missiles to Russia, and says sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and three European powers would not solve any problems between them. \u201cOnce again, US and E3 act on faulty intelligence and flawed logic. Iran has NOT delivered ballistic missiles to Russia. Period\u2026 Sanctions are not a solution, but part of [the] problem,\u201d Minister Abbas Aragchi says in a post on X. The E3 comprises Britain, Germany and France. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that Russia had received ballistic missiles from Iran and was likely to use them in Ukraine within weeks. Cooperation between Moscow and Tehran threatened wider European security, he said. Speaking alongside his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi says that \u201chunger is being used as a weapon against Palestinians, and this is very dangerous.\u201d Without mentioning Israel by name, he says this is a \u201cflagrant violation of human rights before our eyes and we were not able to do anything about it.\u201d Sissi stresses \u201cthe importance of reaching a ceasefire [in Gaza] and developing a mechanism to help the entry of more humanitarian aid as well as the release of the hostages, and to also discuss the postwar stage.\u201d Sissi calls for \u201cEurope to play its role\u201d in encouraging a ceasefire. Sissi says Egypt is \u201cvery keen to play a positive role, whether it\u2019s with the Palestinians and Hamas, in particular, in cooperation with the Qataris and the United States.\u201d He wants to see \u201cextra pressure on the different parties\u201d to end the fighting. Steinmeier is the first German head of state to visit Egypt in a quarter-century. The IDF confirms carrying out a drone strike in southern Lebanon\u2019s Mays al-Jabal this morning, targeting two Hezbollah operatives. One was killed and the second was wounded in the strike. Separately, fighter jets struck a Hezbollah rocket launcher in Marimin, which had been used in previous attacks on Israel, the military says.

Herzog also \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the apparent ramming attack in the West Bank by a Palestinian driver of a fuel tanker in which a man was critically injured. \u201cI call from here, to the leaders of Europe and the whole world in general, to mobilize and fight together against terrorism,\u201d he says."

        "body": "JTA \u2014 A school district in Columbia, South Carolina, will no longer use a graphic novel about local Holocaust survivors in its middle school curriculum, saying it violates new state guidelines governing which books are \u201cappropriate\u201d for the classroom. A spokesperson for the Lexington One school district said that the book \u201cWe Survived the Holocaust,\u201d written to educate young readers, will no longer be used in its fifth- and sixth-grade classrooms. The decision follows the passage this summer of restrictive new guidelines on instructional materials at the State Board of Education. \u201cThis decision is based on a thorough evaluation of the suggested book, \u2018We Survived the Holocaust,\u2019 to determine its age appropriateness in accordance with State Board of Education Regulation (SBE) 43-170, which clarifies standards for the selection of instructional material,\u201d district spokesperson Megan Moore told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Moore added that the book would still be available for eighth graders and in its school library. The decision is reminiscent of policies that have recently limited the reach of Jewish books across the country, including in South Carolina. Another district in the state briefly pulled \u201cThe Fixer,\u201d the Bernard Malamud novel about antisemitism, from its shelves last year, restoring it after a panel review; districts in Florida, Texas, and beyond have pulled various versions of Anne Frank\u2019s diary, \u201cMaus\u201d and other books about the Holocaust and Jewish identity. \u201cI was and continue to be shocked, appalled and dismayed,\u201d Frank Baker, author of \u201cWe Survived the Holocaust,\u201d told JTA. He added that his book, published in 2022, had been used in fifth- and sixth-grade classrooms last year without incident before the new guidelines were passed. On his X social media account, Baker wrote, \u201cRead the book they tried to ban.\u201d The book is a biography of local residents Bluma and Felix Goldberg, who as children were interned in Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen and other concentration camps. They resettled in the Columbia, South Carolina area after the war with the aid of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, now known as HIAS. After seeing Felix Goldberg deliver a lecture on Israel\u2019s Holocaust Remembrance Day, Baker \u2014 who also created a resource guide for classrooms to teach media literacy \u2014 decided to tell the story in a book, with illustrations by Tim Ogline. Read the book they tried to banhttps://t.co/7DLD3zmRyf pic.twitter.com/d4a6XnN7UB \u2014 Frank W. Baker (@fbaker) September 6, 2024 The book is intended for young readers and garnered praise, including from the Jewish Book Council, whose reviewer last year called it \u201cthoroughly researched\u201d and \u201cappro\u00adpri\u00adate\u00adly based on the assump\u00adtion that young read\u00aders need to under\u00adstand the process of Nazi geno\u00adcide.\u201d Baker promoted his book to local districts, alongside learning guides, in the hopes of educating local children about the Holocaust. The Lexington One district initially took him up on the offer to incorporate the book into its lesson plans. But new rules on \u201cage and developmentally appropriate\u201d classroom material, which were supported by the conservative activist group Moms For Liberty, changed that equation. The district also said that its evaluation of Baker\u2019s book \u201cincluded but was not limited to guidance from the South Carolina Council on the Holocaust,\u201d without elaborating further. The council has a relationship with Baker, having hosted him for lectures the past two years. In particular, Baker objected to the district\u2019s contention that the images in his book were too graphic for middle schoolers. The district declined to share its specific objections with JTA. But a social studies coordinator singled out one image in particular \u2014 of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele holding a gun to a Jewish prisoner\u2019s head in Auschwitz \u2014\u00a0 in an email to Baker. \u201cHonestly, these young people are exposed to more violent images in the media they attend to today,\u201d Baker said. \u201cAnd shielding students from a Nazi holding a gun to a Jew\u2019s head \u2014 surely flies in the face of students today who have to undergo shooter drills.\u201d "

        "body": "An Israeli man was run over and critically injured Wednesday at a West Bank bus stop in an apparent attack by the driver of a fuel tanker, reinforcing worries that violence in the territory could continue to heat up. The incident, outside an Israeli settlement near Ramallah, came as security officials have reportedly sought to beef up anti-terror activity in the West Bank, and hours after Palestinians reported that five people had been killed in an Israel Defense Forces drone strike in a town in the West Bank\u2019s Jordan Valley. Footage from the scene of the attack showed a truck with Palestinian license plates veer off a busy highway and barrel full speed into an IDF guard post adjacent to a bus stop before coming to a halt. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it treated an Israeli man in his 20s who suffered critical injuries in the attack. The assailant was neutralized at the scene by soldiers, the IDF said, describing the incident as terrorism. Forces deployed to the scene were setting up roadblocks, the army added. The apparent assault occurred on Route 60 outside Givat Assaf, a former wildcat outpost that the government retroactively legalized in late June, though the settlement\u2019s homes remain unauthorized amid claims that they were placed on private Palestinian land. The suspect was named in media reports as 58-year-old Hayil Dhaifallah, from the central West Bank town of Rafat. His condition was not immediately clear, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s official mouthpiece Wafa reported. The apparent attack was the latest to raise fears of a drastic resurgence in violence in the West Bank, after a series of attempted suicide bombings claimed by Hamas in recent weeks as well as a shooting attack on the Jordanian border Sunday that killed three Israelis. According to Israeli authorities, 32 people including Israeli security personnel have been killed in terror attacks in Israel and the West Bank since October 7, when the war against Hamas in Gaza started with the terror group\u2019s massacre in southern Israel. Another six members of the security forces were killed in clashes with terror operatives in the West Bank over that period. Much of the violence over the past month has taken part in areas of the West Bank outside the northern third of the territory where the IDF has concentrated anti-terror efforts in recent years, including a major 10-day operation in refugee camps connected to Jenin, Tulkarem and the Jordan Valley town of Tubas that ended Saturday. The Palestinian health ministry in the West Bank said Wednesday that five Palestinians were killed in an airstrike in Tubas overnight. Another two people were injured by Israeli fire, one critically, as troops raided Tubas and the neighboring town of Tammun, Wafa reported. An IDF spokesperson confirmed carrying out an airstrike, saying it targeted members of a terror cell. Palestinian authorities did not say whether those killed or injured by Israeli fire were civilians or members of armed groups. Once a rare occurrence, the IDF has carried out more than 70 airstrikes in the West Bank since October 7, using drones, attack helicopters, and fighter jets. A report earlier this week suggested that defense brass were increasingly worried that the violence in the West Bank could swell into a major conflagration, with the military already stretched by intense fighting against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Lebanese terror group Hezbollah on the northern border. According to Channel 12 news, the heads of various security agencies told the cabinet Sunday that Israel \u201cmust do everything to avoid another front,\u201d warning that \u201cwhat is happening in the West Bank could blow up in all of our faces.\u201d Israeli officials have previously said that the violence is being helped along by Iran-backed groups smuggling weapons into the West Bank from Jordan and encouraging attacks. Hardline Israeli settlers in the central and northern West Bank have also appeared to step up attacks on Palestinians in recent weeks, including a fiery rampage on a village last month in which a Palestinian man was killed while trying to confront the rioters. On Wednesday, the Yesh Din organization said extremist youths burned and cut down dozens of olive trees belonging to a Palestinian farmer from the village of Burin in the northern West Bank. Video footage shared by Yesh Din, an Israeli group that campaigns against settler violence, showed masked individuals holding chainsaws and wearing religious Jewish garb leaving an olive grove as fires burn by several trees. The group was later seen walking toward a yeshiva in Yitzhar, a settlement with a long history of extremism southwest of Burin. According to the PA health ministry, more than 670 West Bank Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since October 7. The IDF says the vast majority of them were gunmen killed in exchanges of fire, rioters who clashed with troops or terrorists carrying out attacks. Troops have arrested some 5,000 wanted Palestinians across the West Bank over the same time period, including more than 2,000 affiliated with Hamas. Jeremy Sharon contributed to this report. "

(@swifferupdates) September 11, 2024 Trump on Wednesday dismissed her endorsement, saying he \u201cwas not a Taylor fan.\u201d \u201cIt was just a question of time,\u201d Trump told Fox News in an interview. \u201cShe\u2019s a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she\u2019ll probably pay a price for it\u2026 in the marketplace.\u201d Until Tuesday, Swift had been conspicuously quiet on the subject of 2024\u2019s race, even as many of her fans began organizing under the banner \u201cSwifties for Kamala\u201d and raising more than $150,000 for the Democratic hopeful. But the 34-year-old said discovering AI-generated images of her falsely endorsing Trump \u2014 which \u201cconjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,\u201d she said \u2014 had inspired her to speak up. \u201cIt brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,\u201d she said. \u201cThe simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.\u201d She encouraged her legions of loyal fans to \u201cdo your research.\u201d Swift, fresh off the European leg of her blockbuster \u201cEras\u201d tour, balked at explicitly telling her ardent supporters to vote Harris, instead saying \u201cI\u2019ve done my research, and I\u2019ve made my choice.\u201d \u201cYour research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.\u201d She also shared the post to her Instagram \u201cstories\u201d with a voter registration link.

(@swifferupdates) September 11, 2024 Team Harris has been quick to latch on to any boost she can get from the pop world, which generally skews left, and several stars have publicly backed her. Beyonce has not outright endorsed the Democrat but she allowed the Harris camp to use her song \u201cFreedom\u201d in advertisements and on the campaign trail. And British artist Charli XCX saw her smash album \u201cbrat\u201d become core to the early online Harris campaign, as the Democrats vie to stay current on social media\u2019s pulse. But until now, Swift hadn\u2019t chimed in. A global celebrity with hundreds of millions of social media followers and a wildly loyal \u2014 and chronically online \u2014 fan base, Swift\u2019s influence is vast and her approval coveted. For years the \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer\u00a0stayed emphatically out of politics, including in 2016 when Donald Trump won the presidency. Speculation abounded that\u00a0the superstar\u00a0was a closet Republican until 2018, when she broke both her silence and the internet by endorsing the Democratic opponent of far-right politician Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee. Blackburn won anyway, but it ushered in a new chapter for\u00a0Swift. She later explained that handlers had urged her against voicing political opinions, telling her it could damage her career \u2014 particularly in the country music industry, which despite its complexities is often associated with conservatism. Since then, Swift\u00a0endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and has conveyed pro-LGBTQ messages through her songs and music videos. She also condemned the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the federal right to abortion, and has encouraged droves of her fans to register to vote. But Swift\u2019s massive popularity has also meant she\u2019s a regular target for political misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, often fueled by AI and amplified by the likes of Trump. Speaking out on her own terms gripped the news cycle within seconds of going live Tuesday night, and her post notched more than two million \u201clikes\u201d after just 30 minutes. \u201cWith love and hope, Taylor Swift,\u201d she concluded her message.

        "body": "PARIS \u2014 French authorities foiled three plots to attack the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris and other cities that hosted the summer events, the national counterterrorism prosecutor said on Wednesday. Olivier Christen said the plots included plans to attack \u201cIsraeli institutions or representatives of Israel in Paris\u201d during the July 26 to August 11 Olympic competition. The prosecutor told broadcaster France Info that \u201cthe Israeli team itself was not specifically targeted.\u201d He did not give further details. In all, five people, including a minor, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the three foiled plots against the Summer Games, which were held against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Gaza and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The suspects are facing various terrorism-related charges while they remain in pre-trial detention, the prosecutor said. France was on its highest security alert in the months ahead of the Olympics and Paralympics, which wrapped up last week. During preparations for the Games, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin repeatedly warned that security threats included those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries. In May, members of the General Directorate of Internal Security arrested an 18-year-old man from Chechnya on suspicion of being behind a plan to attack Olympic soccer events that were held in the southern city of Saint-Etienne. The planned attack was to target \u201cbar-type establishments around the Geoffroy stadium,\u201d the prosecutor said. The suspect is accused of planning \u201ca violent action\u201d on behalf of the Islamic State group\u2019s jihadist ideology. Jihadists threats dominated the foiled plots and 80 percent of legal proceedings against suspects include the extremist ideology that still influences France\u2019s youth, the prosecutor said. The Islamic State group continues to \u201cspread propaganda,\u201d he added. Preventive measures included increased house searches and house arrests before the start of the Olympics, the prosecutor said, adding that police and other security personnel conducted 936 house searches so far in 2024, compared to 153 last year."

        "body": "Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian traveled to Iraq on Wednesday on his first trip abroad, hoping to cement Tehran\u2019s ties to Baghdad amid regional tensions threatening to pull the Middle East into a widening war. For Iran, its relationship with Iraq remains crucial for economic, political and religious reasons \u2014 something that has especially been true since the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, who had launched a bloody, years-long war against Iran in the 1980s. Baghdad, meanwhile, has been trying to calibrate its relationship with Tehran, which backs powerful Shiite militias in the country, as well as with the United States, which maintains a force of 2,500 troops in Iraq that remain in battle with remnants of the once-dominant extremist Islamic State group. The American troops remain both a literal and rhetorical target for Iran and its proxies, who have staged attacks on both US troops and Israeli cities over the last 11 months in solidarity with Hamas amid Israel\u2019s military campaign to topple the terror group and free hostages in the Gaza Strip. Just before Pezeshkian\u2019s arrival, an explosion struck a site near Baghdad International Airport used by the US military Tuesday night. The circumstances of the explosion were not clear and there was no immediate information on damages or casualties. Pezeshkian, a relative moderate who was sworn in as Iran\u2019s new president in July, will meet senior Iraqi officials in Baghdad, he said ahead of the trip, according to Iran state media. He is also scheduled to visit Shiite shrines in the cities of Karbala and Najaf, a railroad project linking the southern port city of Basra to Iran, and Irbil, the capital of northern Iraq\u2019s semiautonomous Kurdish region. \u201cWe are planning to sign several agreements,\u201d Iran\u2019s state media quoted Pezeshkian as saying. Ahead of the trip, Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told an Iraqi television channel that Pezeshkian hoped to tighten security relations with Baghdad, as well as economic ties. \u201cWe want to see Iraq develop, grow, be prosperous and strong on our borders, and any economic project that achieves this goal enjoys our support,\u201d Araghchi told Al-Furat Television, owned by Iraqi Shiite cleric and politician Ammar al-Hakim. Still, there have been tensions between the former arch-foes, particularly over Iranian missile attacks on sites in Iraq over the past six years. The assaults have targeted Kurdish militias, a base housing American forces and also what Tehran alleged was an Israeli site in Iraq. US airstrikes in Iraq and on the border with Syria have targeted the militias in response to attacks on American forces. Iran also fired missiles and flew drones over Iraq in its unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April. That attack followed a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, Syria, that killed two Iranian generals and five officers, as well as a member of the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, an Iranian ally. The Islamic Republic has also threatened further retaliation against Israel over the July assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which could include another missile barrage. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the killing. Baghdad has also tried to tackle Iranian concerns over regional separatist groups, moving to relocate some members in a 2023 security pact with Tehran. For Iraq, close ties with the Shiite powerhouse next door are essential to maintain Iranian imports of natural gas necessary to meet its electricity needs. A barter deal for Iraqi crude oil has seen the supply continue, though US sanctions targeting Tehran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program have put pressure on Baghdad to cut economic ties. On Tuesday, the United States and Britain formally accused Iran of supplying short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine, announcing new sanctions on both Moscow and Tehran. "

        "body": "PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (AP) \u2014 Kamala Harris pressed a forceful case against Donald Trump on Tuesday in their first and perhaps only debate before the presidential election Tuesday night, repeatedly goading him in an event that showcased their starkly different visions for the country on abortion, immigration and American democracy. The Democratic vice president provoked Trump with reminders about the 2020 election loss that he still denies, delivered derisive asides at his false claims and sought to underscore the Republican former president\u2019s role in the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of a national right to abortion two years ago. Trump tore into Harris as too liberal and a continuation of president Joe Biden\u2019s unpopular administration, as he launched into the sort of freewheeling personal attacks and digressions from which his advisers and supporters have tried to steer him away. Less than two months from Election Day and hours before the first early ballots will begin to be mailed Wednesday in Alabama, the debate offered the clearest look yet at a presidential race that has been repeatedly upended. Harris\u2019s performance by nearly every measure seemed to be the opposite of President Joe Biden\u2019s in June, with sharp, focused answers designed to showcase the contrast between her and Trump, whereas Biden at times was muddled, halting and at times incoherent. Harris used her body language and facial expressions to confront Trump and express that she found his answers ridiculous, amusing or both \u2014 a pronounced change from Biden\u2019s slack-jawed expression when Trump attacked him. Harris appeared intent on casting herself as a relief for voters seeking a break from Trump\u2019s acerbic politics \u2014 a contrast highlighted as Trump appeared to be set on his back foot by her needling. In one moment, Harris turned to Trump and said that as vice president, she had spoken to foreign leaders who \u201care laughing at Donald Trump,\u201d and said she had spoken to military leaders, \u201cand they say you\u2019re a disgrace.\u201d As Trump, 78, again questioned her racial identity, the 59-year-old Harris, the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, pointedly gestured to Trump and responded, \u201cI think the American people want better than that, want better than this.\u201d Trump in turn tried to link Harris to the still-unpopular Biden, questioning why she hadn\u2019t acted on her proposed ideas while serving as vice president. Trump also focused his attacks on Harris over her assignment by Biden to deal with the root causes of illegal migration. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t she done it? She\u2019s been there for there and a half years,\u201d he said. Speaking to Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump claimed without evidence that the debate moderators were biased against him and rooting for Harris. \u201cIt was a rigged deal, as I assumed it would be, because when you looked at the fact that they were correcting everything and not correcting with her,\u201d he said. At the debate, Harris promised tax cuts aimed at the middle class and said she would push to restore a federally guaranteed right to abortion overturned by the Supreme Court two years ago. Trump said his proposed tariffs would help the US stop being cheated by allies on trade and said he would work to swiftly end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 though he twice refused to say he believed it was in America\u2019s interest for Ukraine, which bipartisan majorities in Congress have backed, to win the war. Trump again denied that he lost to Biden four years ago, when a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol to try to stop the certification of his loss based on false or unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. He tried to reverse the question of threats to American democracy and suggested criticism of him could be linked to the assassination attempt he survived in July. \u201cI probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey talk about democracy, I\u2019m a threat to democracy. They\u2019re the threat to democracy.\u201d Trump has in recent days ramped up his threats of retribution if he returns to the White House, saying he would prosecute lawyers, donors, and other officials whom he deems to \u201ccheat\u201d in the election. \u201cDonald Trump was fired by 81 million people,\u201d Harris said, \u201cSo let\u2019s be clear about that. And clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that.\u201d Her campaign ended the debate by expressing openness to another meeting in October \u2014 and welcomed an endorsement from megastar Taylor Swift, who labeled herself a \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d in a dig at Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as she encouraged her fans to vote. Harris sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs \u2014 and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned \u2014 as pragmatism. Asked about her changing positions on a number of issues, she twice repeated a phrase she has used to try to explain it away, saying, \u201cMy values have not changed.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, quickly went after Harris for abandoning some of her past liberal positions and said: \u201cShe\u2019s going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat.\u201d Harris smiled broadly and laughed. Harris, in zeroing in on one of Trump\u2019s biggest electoral vulnerabilities, laid the end of a federally guaranteed right to abortion at Trump\u2019s feet for his role in appointing three US Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving more than 20 states in the country with what she called \u201cTrump abortion bans.\u201d Harris gave one of her most impassioned answers as she described the ways women have been denied abortion care and other emergency care since that ruling, and said Trump would sign a national abortion ban if he wins. Trump declared it \u201ca lie,\u201d and said, \u201cI\u2019m not signing a ban and there\u2019s no reason to sign a ban.\u201d The Republican has said he wants the issue left to the states. Trump, who is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House, continued to call Harris a \u201cMarxist\u201d and said, \u201cEveryone knows she\u2019s a Marxist.\u201d Harris\u2019 eyebrows shot up and she made an amused face, bringing her hand to her chin and staring at him. Trump attacked Harris for the inflation seen under the Biden-Harris administration, a major liability for the vice president. He quickly turned his answer to warning about immigrants coming into the country \u2014 one of the subjects he\u2019s focused on most heavily in his campaign. He called his proposed tariffs a straightforward way to make other countries pay up for what he has long argued is an imbalance that hurts the US. Harris called the tariffs an effective national sales tax. Trump reacted swiftly and called that \u201can incorrect statement.\u201d Throughout his campaign, Trump has leaned on illegal immigration, an issue that has bedeviled Biden and Harris with rising numbers of illegal border crossings and the arrivals of thousands of people needing shelter in Democratic-led cities. He accused Democrats of abetting large numbers of unauthorized crossings \u2014 though they have dropped in recent months in part due to new asylum restrictions by the Biden administration. But as he often does in his rallies and on his social media account, Trump reeled off a series of falsehoods or unproven claims about migrants. One of those claims was a debunked rumor that Trump and his allies have spread online in recent days, alleging Haitian immigrants in an Ohio town are hunting and eating pets. Officials in Springfield, Ohio, say they have no evidence of that happening. \u201cTalk about extreme,\u201d Harris said after Trump talked about dogs and cats being eaten. As the debate opened, Harris walked up to Trump\u2019s lectern to introduce herself, marking the first time the two had ever met, since Trump skipped her 2021 inauguration. \u201cKamala Harris,\u201d she said, extending her hand to Trump, who received it in a handshake \u2014 the first presidential debate handshake since the 2016 campaign. Trump has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes and falsely claiming that Harris, who attended a historically Black university, hid her race during her career. \u201cI read where she was not Black,\u201d Trump said when asked about comments questioning Harris\u2019 race, adding a minute later, \u201cand then I read that she was Black.\u201d He seemed to suggest her race was a choice, saying twice, \u201cThat\u2019s up to her.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people,\u201d Harris responded. While Tuesday\u2019s meeting might be the last time the candidates cross paths on the debate stage, they may cross paths again Wednesday when they both mark the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Harris, Trump and Biden plan to all be at ground zero in lower Manhattan and the Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville, Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Harris and Biden will also visit the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, later in the day for a ceremony there. Trump at one point launched into an attack on Biden, questioning his mental acuity by making the claim that Biden \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s alive.\u201d Harris quickly tried to turn it around to make Trump look less than sharp. \u201cFirst of all, I think it\u2019s important to remind the former president, you\u2019re not running against Joe Biden. You\u2019re running against me,\u201d she said."
