Get a Sample PDF Brochure: https://www.sphericalinsights.com/request-sample/5616 Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) is the process of planning, delivering, managing, and enhancing IT services within a company. ITSM ensures that IT services meet the business's and customers' needs efficiently. It includes a range of processes and practices to manage IT infrastructure and services more effectively. The main goal of ITSM is to align IT services with business requirements and ensure they support business objectives. This involves managing incidents (like system failures), problems (underlying causes of issues), changes (updates to the IT environment), and service requests (such as new hardware or software). ITSM is often guided by frameworks like ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), which provides best practices for managing IT services. By using ITSM practices, companies can improve service quality, increase efficiency, and use IT resources effectively. Ultimately, ITSM helps businesses offer a better user experience and achieve their goals through efficient IT service management. Globalization, increased competition, and the demand for customized products have made it essential for organizations to focus on core business functions. Any IT department disruption can impact the entire business, requiring resources to fix the issue. Service management helps by automating processes like system restoration and network fault management, reducing the workload on system administrators, and enabling real-time problem resolution. While initial human input is needed to set guidelines and policies, automating these processes can streamline operations and minimize disruptions.

(NASDAQ: LFCR), Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE: SRG), Oddity Tech (NASDAQ: ODD), and Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: ABR). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Lifecore Biomedical, Inc.

The lawsuit alleges that (i) Lifecore maintained deficient internal controls over financial reporting; (ii) as a result, the Company issued several financial statements that were inaccurate and would need to be restated; (iii) Lifecore\u2019s purported remediation efforts with respect to the foregoing deficiencies were ineffective; (iv) all of the foregoing impaired Lifecore\u2019s ability to timely file periodic reports with the SEC in compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements; and (v) accordingly, the Company\u2019s financial position and/or prospects were materially overstated.

Then, on May 10, 2024, after the market closed, Seritage released its first quarter 2024 financial results, revealing it was \u201cadjusting [its] pricing projections for some of [its] assets.\u201d As a result, the gross value of the Company\u2019s portfolio of assets was reduced by at least $325 million.

Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the Company lacked effective internal controls regarding the identification and review of impairment indicators for investments in real estate; (2) that, as a result, the Company had overstated the value and projected gross proceeds of certain real estate assets; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

        "body": "NEW YORK, Aug.  17, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, \u00a0throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike\u2019s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
