        "body": "Gemini Live, Google\u2019s answer to the recently launched (in limited alpha) Advanced Voice Mode for OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT , is rolling out on Tuesday, months after being announced at Google\u2019s I/O 2024 developer conference . It was announced at Google\u2019s Made by Google 2024 event . Gemini Live lets users have \u201cin-depth\u201d voice chats with Gemini, Google\u2019s generative AI-powered chatbot , on their smartphones. Thanks to an enhanced speech engine that delivers what Google claims is more consistent, emotionally expressive and realistic multi-turn dialogue, people can interrupt Gemini while the chatbot\u2019s speaking to ask follow-up questions, and it\u2019ll adapt to their speech patterns in real time. Here\u2019s how Google describes it in a blog post: \u201cWith Gemini Live [via the Gemini app ], you can talk to Gemini and choose from [10 new] natural-sounding voices it can respond with. You can even speak at your own pace or interrupt mid-response with clarifying questions, just like you would in any conversation.\u201d Gemini Live is hands-free if you want it to be. You can keep speaking with the Gemini app in the background or when your phone\u2019s locked, and conversations can be paused and resumed at any time. So how might this be useful? Google gives the example of rehearsing for a job interview \u2014 a bit of an ironic scenario , but OK. Gemini Live can practice with you, Google says, giving speaking tips and suggesting skills to highlight when speaking with a hiring manager (or AI, as the case may be ). One advantage Gemini Live might have over ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode is a better memory. The architecture of the generative AI model underpinning Live, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash, has a longer-than-average \u201ccontext window,\u201d meaning they can take in and reason over a lot of data \u2014 theoretically hours of back-and-forth conversations \u2014 before crafting a response. \u201cLive uses our Gemini Advanced models that we have adapted to be more conversational,\u201d a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \u201cThe model\u2019s large context window is utilized when users have long conversations with Live.\u201d We\u2019ll have to see how well this all works in practice, of course. If OpenAI\u2019s setbacks with Advanced Voice Mode are any indication, rarely do demos translate seamlessly to the real world. Image Credits: Google On that subject, Gemini Live doesn\u2019t have one of the capabilities Google showcased at I/O just yet: multimodal input. Back in May, Google released pre-recorded videos showing Gemini Live seeing and responding to users\u2019 surroundings via photos and footage captured by their phones\u2019 cameras \u2014 for example, naming a part on a broken bicycle or explaining what a portion of code on a computer screen does. Multimodal input will arrive \u201clater this year,\u201d Google said, declining to provide specifics. Also later this year, Live will expand to additional languages and to iOS via the Google app; it\u2019s only available in English for the time being. Gemini Live, like Advanced Voice Mode, isn\u2019t free. It\u2019s exclusive to Gemini Advanced, a more sophisticated version of Gemini that\u2019s gated behind the Google One AI Premium Plan , priced at $20 per month. Other new Gemini features on the way are free, though. Android users can soon (in the coming weeks) bring up Gemini\u2019s overlay on top of any app they\u2019re using to ask questions about what\u2019s on the screen (e.g., a YouTube video) by holding their phone\u2019s power button or saying, \u201cHey Google.\u201d Gemini will be able to generate images (but still not images of people , unfortunately) directly from the overlay \u2014 images that can be dragged and dropped into apps like Gmail and Google Messages. Gemini is also gaining new integrations with Google services (or \u201cextensions,\u201d as the company prefers to call them) both on mobile and the web. In the coming weeks, Gemini will be able to take more actions with Google Calendar, Keep, Tasks, YouTube Music and Utilities, the apps that control on-device features like timers and alarms, media controls, the flashlight, volume, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and so on. In a blog post, Google gives a few ideas of how people might take advantage. Sounds nifty, assuming it all works reliably: Ask Gemini to \u201cmake a playlist of songs that remind me of the late \u201990s.\u201d Snap a photo of a concert flier and ask Gemini if you\u2019re free that day \u2014 and even set a reminder to buy tickets. Have Gemini dig out a recipe from Gmail and ask it to add the ingredients to your shopping list in Keep. Lastly, starting later this week, Gemini will be available on Android tablets."

        "body": "Search engine optimization (SEO) has been top of mind for brands for more than a decade to ensure their websites and products capture as many eyeballs as possible by ranking high up on search results pages. But search is changing, and as consumers increasingly turn to AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude to search for things, brands need a new strategy. Profoun d launched to help brands better figure out how they appear in AI searches by tracking common search queries for brands. For example, if a user is in the automotive industry, their dashboard would automatically contain data on searches like \u201cwhat is the best SUV?\u201d People can also use the platform to run more-specific searches to find out how search results change by demographic data or to get in the weeds about how AI systems rank the trustworthiness of websites talking about specific products. The New York-based company was launched earlier this year by James Cadwallader and Dylan Babbs, who met at startup incubator South Park Commons. Cadwallader told TechCrunch that he and Babbs became obsessed with how AI was changing online search. Cadwallader said his experience working with big Fortune 500 brands as a former founder of data-driven influencer marketing agency Kyra helped spark the specific idea behind Profound. \u201cIn this new world of AI answers, how does Nike understand and control how they show up? If I\u2019m asking ChatGPT for a running sneaker, it will give me four or five suggestions,\u201d Cadwallader said. \u201cNike spends $4 billion a year on marketing and hundreds of millions of people are using these AI answers to research products and brands on a daily basis. How do we show up in the new world?\u201d The platform is dynamic, as opposed to a static snapshot, Babbs said, so as AI search continues to evolve and may change what it favors \u2014\u00a0a common occurrence for SEO rankings \u2014\u00a0brands using Profound can track changes and adjust. Cadwallader said the startup is still in its infancy but has already started working with a large branding agency; Profound also has two other contracts in the works. The company is now emerging from stealth with $3.5 million in seed money from a round that included Keith Rabois, through Khosla Ventures, Saga, South Park Commons and angel investors Scott Belsky and Balaji S. Srinivasan. Cadwallader said Profound plans to use the money to hire and to continue building out the tech. Ben Braverman, a co-founder and managing partner at Saga, told TechCrunch that he met Cadwallader through a talk he gave at South Park Commons. \u201cAs soon as you start talking to [Cadwallader] about what he is building, the energy is dripping off this guy,\u201d Braverman said. \u201cThe more time I spent with him, a delightful human being, talking about where the puck was moving in AI, it was a lightbulb moment, I have to spend more time with this person.\u201d Braverman added that he\u2019s been able to eavesdrop on sales calls and it seems like potential customers quickly come to understand the need for this kind of tech. Braverman was also interested because he thinks Profound is building itself a moat, and the way the company is serving the brands it works with will prevent those companies from wanting to build the tech in-house. But that jury is likely still out. While Profound may be one of the companies looking to tackle this area, it will not be the last. As AI search becomes an increasing area of conversation, there will be existing SEO firms or marketing agencies in addition to other startups looking to build up their prowess in this area. \u201cIn this new world, every company, every business across every industry is going to want to know how they show up in AI answers,\u201d Cadwallader said. \u201cProfound will be the solution that every company in the world uses every day to understand how these AI systems are talking about them.\u201d"

        "body": "A social media spat between billionaire tech investors is raising questions about the journalistic independence of three-year-old news outfit SF Standard, after a reporter representing the outlet reached out to sources for a story about VC Ben Horowitz and his wife Felicia. The Standard\u2019s sole backer is another longtime VC, Michael Moritz, and on Thursday night, in a tirade on the X platform, Horowitz called the \u201ccoming article\u201d a \u201ccheap hit piece\u201d directed by Moritz and accused Moritz of \u201chaving his fake disinformation \u2018newspaper\u2019 fabricate hit pieces on his business rival, me.\u201d Horowitz\u2019s business partner, Marc Andreessen, later waded in to echo the accusations and lob a few more insults for good measure. TechCrunch has reached out to both Moritz and SF Standard Executive Editor Jon Steinberg for comment. Moritz has yet to respond, but in an emailed statement to TechCrunch, Steinberg writes: \u201cI can confirm [reporter] Emily Shugerman is working on a story about the Horowitzes for the San Francisco Standard. Beyond that, I can\u2019t comment on the substance of our piece prior to publication.\u201d The Standard has previously covered news about Horowitz and Andreessen; it has also published news about Moritz. Interestingly, some of its coverage has been about thousands of acres of rural land north of San Francisco that is being acquired by tech entrepreneurs and investors, including both Moritz and Andreessen."

        "body": "Tally , a nine-year-old fintech that helped consumers manage and pay off their credit card debt, has shut down, according to the company. In a LinkedIn post that was shared earlier Monday, founder and CEO Jason Brown said the \u201csad and difficult\u201d decision to close down Tally was not the outcome the company had \u201choped for,\u201d but that \u201cafter exploring all options,\u201d it was \u201cunable to secure the necessary funding to continue our operations.\u201d According to PitchBook, Tally was last valued at $855 million and had 183 employees. Tally\u2019s model was initially designed to help people manage their credit cards and pay off high-interest debt through a lower interest loan that it offered.\u00a0But in April, Tally announced it would be sunsetting its consumer app and shifting to B2B . At the time, the company said it had a launch partner, a \u201clarge publicly-traded consumer company with more than 50 million users,\u201d that was launching in July. However, it never followed up with an announcement naming the company. TechCrunch has reached out to the company for further details. Founded in 2015, San Francisco-based Tally had raised $172 million in funding over the years. In October of 2022, Tally raised an $80 million Series D led by Sway Ventures. Andreessen Horowitz led its $50 million Series C round in 2019, which also included participation from Silicon Valley heavy hitters such as Kleiner Perkins , Shasta Ventures , Cowboy Ventures and Sway Ventures .

        "body": "Molly Alter wears a lot of hats. She\u2019s a mocumentary filmmaker working on a project about an alternate reality where charades is big business. She\u2019s a caesar salad connoisseur and documents her rankings of different restaurants\u2019 attempts on a blog called JULIUS. She\u2019s also Northzone\u2019s newest partner. Alter\u2019s path to venture capital was not an obvious one. Her parents were journalists and she grew up heavily involved in creative passions like theater and improv comedy. These interests were the basis for the company Alter started at Harvard that filmed a cappella concerts and dance recitals and ultimately led her to VC. She told TechCrunch that she really just started that company as a way to make money \u2014 it was better than her other job cleaning toilets \u2014 but it morphed into a real business that scaled up to 27 employees. Then Insight Partners came knocking via a message sent on Facebook Messenger to see if Alter wanted to join their analyst program. \u201cI went to Insight straight out of undergrad,\u201d said Alter, who graduated from Harvard. \u201cMy rationale was that I\u2019m not from this world. I don\u2019t know anything about these different businesses and business models. There is a lot for me to learn about starting companies. I\u2019ll get a broad exposure and after a couple years, I\u2019ll start my next company.\u201d She didn\u2019t end up starting that other business and has been in venture ever since. After nearly five years at Insight, she moved over to Index as a partner out of their London office in 2020. She moved to Northzone and to New York City in 2023. Now she\u2019s being promoted to partner at the firm and will continue her focus on vertical software. Northzone is a multistage firm that currently backs startups in the U.S. and Europe out of its \u20ac1.1 billion 10th fund. While Alter assumed she\u2019d go back to being an entrepreneur, she realized being a VC was a better fit for her and that building blocks for that career were always there even if she hadn\u2019t noticed them. She said as a kid, she was always questioning and was obsessed with how things were made and where they came from down to the bread she used to make toast. \u201cWhat you are doing at its core by investing in innovation, is finding out how things work right now and how things could be better,\u201dAlter said. Alter said she likes that being a VC requires her to go deep into a subject and learn all the ins and outs about it. She said her investment in GovDash is a great example. While software for government contracts may not seem super interesting on the surface, Alter said she was fascinated by all the intricacies like how even a government contract for a janitor needs to be vetted for potential corruption. \u201cThis is such an exciting job,\u201d Alter said. \u201cYou are learning about things that are right under your nose and learning how these things work today and if they are broken how an entrepreneur could fix that.\u201d Alter thinks her creative background and current pursuits has made her a better investor. A direct example is that her interest in film led her to source a Series C investment into Frame.io in 2019 when she was at Insight. The company built a cloud-based video collaboration platform, which Alter understood the need for immediately based on her past experiences in film. The company later exited through a $1.3 billion sale to Adobe in 2021 after raising about $90 million. She added that she thinks it helps in less tangible ways too. She likes having other things to talk about with founders to help them relax and not feel like they need to be talking about their company 24/7. \u201cI do have a ton of diverse interests and it helps me build stronger relationships with founders and build that trust to go through thick and thin,\u201d Alter said. Being a VC hasn\u2019t always been the easiest job, Alter said, but she\u2019s ready to double down on investing with this latest role. She wants to cut through the AI noise to find the startups with real potential and she remains bullish on vertical software and investing out of New York. \u201cI think there were times where I had to exercise that grit and feel like I was pushing a rock up a hill,\u201d Alter said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy but I have really felt that this is the right industry for me to be in. My test of that is, am I excited on a Sunday night to launch into a week of meeting founders or do I get Sunday scaries? Sundays at Northzone, I\u2019m chomping at the bit.\u201d"

Faulkner was an associate investor at Threshold Ventures, and at Bessemer Venture Partners before that, leaving the VC world in 2021 to pursue cycling. She wasn\u2019t initially scheduled to ride in the 158-kilometer (98-mile) road cycling race but took her teammate Taylor Knibb\u2019s spot at the last minute. Faulkner passed the favorites to win gold that day. She won a second medal as part of the gold-winning U.S. women\u2019s velodrome track cycling team. \u201cAs a VC, you sit down with entrepreneurs every single day who are going to do something they\u2019re passionate about. They have these big ideas. They\u2019re taking risks,\u201d she told Fortune , add that such thinking helps her win races. \u201cIf a VC thinks there\u2019s a 50% chance the company is going to be successful, that doesn\u2019t mean they go 50% all-in for the company. When you invest, assess the risk and make your decision, but then you go all-in. You don\u2019t look back. You have to commit. I think that\u2019s something that shaped me.\u201d"

        "body": "Balderton Capital \u2014\u00a0one of the older, larger European VCs noted for investing in Revolut and Wayve \u2014\u00a0has raised a fresh $1.3 billion in total, spread across two funds. Its Early Stage Fund IX will get $615 million, and its Growth Fund II will get $685 million. The news was greeted with cautious optimism by the VCs TechCrunch spoke with. It\u2019s also a further indication that European VC is picking up after a lackluster couple of years following the ZIRP and post-COVID-driven bull-run of 2021 and 2022. Indeed, the London-based Balderton pointed to research that said European VC funds have outperformed VCs in the U.S. over 10- and 15-year periods, based on data from both Invest Europe and Cambridge Associates. In an interview with TechCrunch, partner Suranga Chandratillake said the raise had gone relatively smoothly: \u201cWe raised [these funds] faster than we\u2019ve ever raised them before. It was about 80% reupping of existing LPs.\u201d He said the fund has also raised from a large, but unnamed, U.S.-based institution: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve heard a lot is that European venture feels like a proper, solid, here-to-stay part of the industry VC globally, which obviously seems like old news to me or to you, but it\u2019s amazing how long that takes, in a global sense, to really permeate into everybody\u2019s way of thinking about the world.\u201d In fact, European AI startups Mistral, Wayve and Poolside AI now account for 18% of all European VC funding, according to Dealroom . Balderton\u2019s fundraise follows raises by other VCs in Europe, including Accel\u2019s European arm, Index Ventures and Creandum. In the last 12 months, Balderton has announced 12 new investments: Checkly, SAVA, Tinybird, Qargo, Huspy, trawa, Payflows, Scalable Capital, Lassie, Writer, Anytype and Deepset. However, the firm\u2019s Europe-only focus means it has largely missed out on investing in the \u201cfoundational\u201d wave of AI startups out of Silicon Valley, such as OpenAI and Anthropic. These have ben backed by giant U.S. firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners, all of which now have London offices. Balderton has singled out London and Paris as key innovation centers. But despite having Bernard Liautaud, a Frenchman, as managing partner of the fund, Balderton didn\u2019t opt to back the Paris-based Mistral. \u201cWe think Mistral is a great company and there\u2019s nothing negative about the team or their mission,\u201d Chandratillake told me. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a hard investment for a more early-stage focused VC like ourselves because it\u2019s the kind of company that will have to raise huge amounts of money to stay up with the leaders. If you are early in those sorts of companies, you get really squashed. You won\u2019t have the firepower to keep going, to write checks of hundreds of millions of dollars. And so you get squashed in the cap table, you lose your relevance, you lose your board seat, etc., etc. So it was not necessarily a good fit for our kind of fund. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a great company. It just isn\u2019t a very good fit for us.\u201d Is the strategy instead to watch the whole AI field play out and pick off the emerging companies? \u201cWe believe in foundational models, and we believe that there should be a healthy market of those. But we think that the amount of capital required to build a great foundational model is colossal, [and better suits] private equity firms, hyperscaler public companies that are printing cash in their core businesses,\u201d Chandratillake said. \u201cWe do think there are a lot of interesting companies that are going to get built that use this technology in different ways to solve very specific problems and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see a lot of our dollars going. Wayve is in our portfolio, and they have raised the largest single round of any AI company in Europe. So I think we feel pretty good about AI.\u201d TechCrunch also spoke to other VCs to gauge industry opinion about the raise. Brent Hoberman, founder of firstminute capital (a $400 million AUM seed fund) said: \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging for Europe, especially the pure Europe focus and the stats regarding Euro VCs outperforming the U.S. Europe riding on top of foundation models heavily funded from USA is valid, too.\u201d \u201cIt is great news for European tech. We need more and experienced capital, especially at the growth stage in Europe,\u201d commented Apostolos Apostolakis, partner with VentureFriends , Athens. Susanne Najafi, founding partner at BackingMinds VC in Stockholm, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great. More capital for European startups \u2014 both early and growth. Regarding growth, we\u2019re a firm believer that it will be easier for growth startups to raise their rounds here versus relying on U.S. funds for that. That might still be relevant + value adding, but now European growth funds can compete to a larger extent.\u201d Another unnamed VC, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of market repercussions, said he backed Balderton\u2019s decision not to invest in Mistral: \u201cI believe Balderton has always had a very realistic, almost calm view on things \u2026 They might not be the most fancy brand, but they are certainly the one that returns money. They likely missed out on hundreds of outliers over the years, but chose many great ones to create a diversified portfolio. I would call them sober decision-makers. And big institutional investors want this, along with repeat business. Investing in Balderton is akin to investing in Revaia, Highland and Verdane.\u201d However, not everyone is so impressed. Andrew J. Scott, founding partner at 7percent Ventures said: \u201cWhat\u2019s critical is that European Series A-plus managers have the guts to back really big foundational technology bets, not only software layer applications which show established revenue. If they don\u2019t, the U.S. will control AI, space and robotics for the next 30 years in the same way it controls the web, search and cloud compute today.\u201d This story was updated to include another quote from a VC about Balderton\u2019s decision not to invest in Mistral."

The gang would hold the data hostage in exchange for a ransom, and threaten to publish the data if the ransom wasn\u2019t paid, a common tactic used by extortion gangs known as \u201cdouble extortion.\u201d"

        "body": "Techstars is laying off 17% of its workforce and will end its $80 million J.P. Morgan-backed AdvancingCities program once the fund is completely deployed at the end of this year, TechCrunch has learned. The AdvancingCities program, which launched in 2022, saw the launch of accelerator programs across the nation in cities like Oakland, New York, Miami and Washington, D.C. with the goal of backing more diverse founders. J.P. Morgan sponsored the program with a commitment through December, but the relationship between the bank and Techstars soured almost immediately, as TechCrunch previously reported . The bank was supposed to commit to continuing the program last summer so Techstars could start fundraising for another round with the hope of deploying capital from the second round in 2025. But it didn\u2019t commit by that earlier deadline. As of our earlier report, the fate of around 20 Techstars employees who worked on the program was unclear. \u201cIn 2022, J.P. Morgan announced the $80MM Advancing Cities Fund, raised as a private placement to invest in a Techstars accelerator program focused on advancing equitable access to funding among diverse founders across the U.S,\u201d a J.P Morgan spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cThe fund is expected to be fully deployed by the end of this year, as planned. JPMorganChase remains committed to supporting across the country through the expansion of its diverse manager network, private investments platform and engagement capabilities.\u201d The news that the program was officially shut down was reported on Wednesday by The Information. In an email about the layoffs, Techstars co-founder and CEO David Cohen told staff that the startup accelerator \u201coverbuilt and over hired.\u201d He said that most of the layoffs would come from engineering, support services and those working on sales and partnerships. He promised that those running most accelerator programs would not be impacted with the exception of the J.P. Morgan programs, specifically the AdvancingCities program. The news comes during a transformative year for Techstars. Techstars\u2019 now-former CEO Ma\u00eblle\u00a0Gavet stepped down in May, with Cohen stepping back into the role upon her departure. Wednesday\u2019s layoff also follows a 7% headcount reduction in January, as TechCrunch previously reported. Techstars\u2019 strategy under Gavet was to scale into more programs and back more startups, but it was met with criticism from those in the investment community as the organization began earlier this year to restructure itself. Cohen somewhat addressed the criticisms in that email to staff today, saying that the firm would now \u201cstop focusing on scaling and shift all of our focus to being better for founders each and every day.\u201d Techstars declined further comment but pointed to Cohen\u2019s email which it published on its website. Note: This story was updated to add a statement from J.P. Morgan."

        "body": "AI companies are gobbling up investor money and securing sky-high valuations early in their life cycle. This dynamic has many calling the AI industry a bubble. Nick Frosst, a co-founder of Cohere, which builds custom AI models for enterprise customers, recently said on TechCrunch\u2019s Found podcast that he doesn\u2019t think the AI industry is in a bubble. While he acknowledges the froth, he thinks calling it a bubble discredits the companies, like his own Cohere, that are creating genuinely useful features for its customers. \u201cFrequently I\u2019ll run into something where I\u2019ll see somebody using our model, and they will have enabled some completely new feature that wasn\u2019t possible before or they\u2019ll have automated some process that was really bogging them down and slowing everything up,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cAnd like that\u2019s tangible value. It\u2019s hard for there to be a complete bubble when you have something so useful.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean Frosst is bullish on everything the industry is building. He doesn\u2019t think AI is really ever going to get to artificial general intelligence, defined as human-level intelligence, which is a noticeably different narrative from some of Frosst\u2019s AI peers like Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang . He added that if the industry does get there, it\u2019s not going to be for a long time. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna have digital gods anywhere, anytime soon,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cAnd I think more and more people are kind of coming to that realization, saying this technology is incredible. It\u2019s super powerful, super useful. It\u2019s not a digital god. And that requires adjusting how you\u2019re thinking about the technology.\u201d Frosst said they try to be realistic at Cohere about what AI technology can and can\u2019t do and what types of neural networks can provide the most value. Cohere\u2019s approach to building its business model is based on the research work of Cohere co-founder and CEO Aidan Gomez while at Google Brain. Gomez is, of course, known for his extensive AI research. He\u2019s most famous for co-writing a paper that bought AI the transformer model that ushered in this generative AI era. But he also co-wrote a paper in 2017 called One Model to Learn Them All . This research came to the conclusion that an all-encompassing large language model is more useful than small models trained for a specific task or on data from a specific industry, Frosst said. Today, Cohere uses that main model as a base to build custom models for enterprise clients. \u201cWe specialize as people. We go into particular fields. But the first part of our education is just about how to use language in general,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cWe spent a long time learning how to read and write. It\u2019s not until very later that you kind of specify on a particular subfield of language. So there\u2019s something kind of similar going on with neural nets as well.\u201d But despite thinking larger, foundational models will win in his market \u2014 among those building such services \u2014 he doesn\u2019t think enterprise companies should ask their own single models to do everything: consumer tasks, B2B tasks, product tasks. Frosst says that companies that want to use AI technology successfully should focus and also be aware of what AI technology can and can\u2019t do. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty sober about how this technology is useful, and what value it can deliver, and to be clear, an insane amount of value,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to bring about the death of all humans. And so we\u2019re able to kind of have this realistic approach that maybe spares us from some of the extreme rhetoric on either side.\u201d"

        "body": "World Labs, a stealthy startup founded by renowned Stanford University AI professor Fei-Fei Li, has raised two rounds of financing\u00a0two months apart, according to multiple reports. The latest financing was led by NEA and valued the company at over $1 billion, TechCrunch has learned from several people with knowledge of the investments. This was a $100 million round previously reported by the Financial Times in July. This was a significant increase in valuation from World Labs\u2019 initial financing, which took place in April, and valued World Labs at $200 million, one person said. Investors in the first round included Andreessen Horowitz and Canadian firm Radical Ventures, where Li is a scientific partner, Reuters reported in May . Li and NEA didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. World Labs, which was reportedly founded in April and went from founding to unicorn in four months, suggests that investors continue to place large bets on AI startups founded by prominent AI scientists, even if the startups businesses are unproven. In the case of World Labs, what Li is working on is particularly difficult to do and could be essential in the AI-driven world that Silicon Valley is madly building. It\u2019s aiming to create AI models that can accurately estimate the three-dimensional physicality of real-world objects and environments, enabling detailed digital replicas without the need for extensive data collection. Li, widely known as a \u201cGodmother of AI,\u201d discussed how machines can be trained to develop human-like \u201cspatial intelligence\u201d\u00a0in a TED talk earlier this year. \u201cVery little three-dimensional data exists in the world,\u201d said one investor familiar with World Labs\u2019 approach. \u201cAutonomous vehicle companies collect that data by driving thousands and thousands of miles to create three-dimensional data, which they then use to train their machines. In all other applications, like serving coffee, there\u2019s no three-dimensional data. Collecting that data is expensive because the universe of places you have to collect data is enormous.\u201d Once available, World Labs\u2019 models can be used in gaming and robotics applications, she said. Li is best known for her work on ImageNet, a dataset that revolutionized computer vision. She is currently on partial leave until December 2025 from her role as co-director of Stanford\u2019s Human-Centered AI Institute."

You won\u2019t be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have \u201cslightly more restrictive content policies,\u201d according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear: \u201cThe signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,\u201d a spokesperson said. March 2024 OpenAI\u2019s chatbot store is filling up with spam TechCrunch found that the OpenAI\u2019s GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs . A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools. The New York Times responds to OpenAI\u2019s claims that it \u201chacked\u201d ChatGPT for its copyright lawsuit In a court filing opposing OpenAI\u2019s motion to dismiss The New York Times\u2019 lawsuit alleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that \u201cOpenAI\u2019s attention-grabbing claim that The Times \u2018hacked\u2019 its products is as irrelevant as it is false.\u201d The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls. OpenAI VP doesn\u2019t say whether artists should be paid for training data At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI\u2019s VP of consumer product dodged a question on whether artists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated . While OpenAI lets artists \u201copt out\u201d of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous. A new report estimates that ChatGPT uses more than half a million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day ChatGPT\u2019s environmental impact appears to be massive. According to a report from The New Yorker , ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day. ChatGPT can now read its answers aloud OpenAI released a new Read Aloud feature for the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps. The feature allows ChatGPT to read its responses to queries in one of five voice options and can speak 37 languages, according to the company. Read aloud is available on both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models. ChatGPT can now read responses to you. On iOS or Android, tap and hold the message and then tap \u201cRead Aloud\u201d.

ChatGPT will now remember \u2014 and forget \u2014 things you tell it to As part of a test, OpenAI began rolling out new \u201cmemory\u201d controls for a small portion of ChatGPT free and paid users, with a broader rollout to follow. The controls let you tell ChatGPT explicitly to remember something, see what it remembers or turn off its memory altogether. Note that deleting a chat from chat history won\u2019t erase ChatGPT\u2019s or a custom GPT\u2019s memories \u2014 you must delete the memory itself.

OpenAI argued that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law \u201cdoes not forbid training.\u201d OpenAI claims The New York Times\u2019 copyright lawsuit is without merit OpenAI published a public response to The New York Times\u2019s lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit. In the response , OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to \u201cact responsibly.\u201d We build AI to empower people, including journalists.

FAQs: What is ChatGPT? How does it work? ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI . The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. When did ChatGPT get released? November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. What is the latest version of ChatGPT? Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o . Can I use ChatGPT for free? There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus . Who uses ChatGPT? Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. What companies use ChatGPT? Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool . Most recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.\u00a0 And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. What does GPT mean in ChatGPT? GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot? A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Can ChatGPT write essays? Yes. Can ChatGPT commit libel? Due to the nature of how these models work , they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Does ChatGPT have an app? Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users. What is the ChatGPT character limit? It\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Does ChatGPT have an API? Yes, it was released March 1, 2023. What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT? Everyday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT? Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. How good is ChatGPT at writing code? It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used. Can you save a ChatGPT chat? Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Are there alternatives to ChatGPT? Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together , Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude , and developers are creating open source alternatives . How does ChatGPT handle data privacy? OpenAI has\u00a0said\u00a0that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form . This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201c OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request \u201d. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT? Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools , have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with . There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes . Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts? Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase . Another is ChatX . More launch every day. Can ChatGPT be detected? Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests , they\u2019re inconsistent at best. Are ChatGPT chats public? No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service. What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT? None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT? Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data."

        "body": "Last year\u2019s investor dreams of a strong 2024 IPO pipeline have faded, if not fully disappeared, as we settle in to the second half of the year. This year delivered four venture-backed tech IPOs \u2014 Reddit , Astera Labs , Ibotta and Rubrik \u2014 in March and April, which made it seem like this year could spur the momentum investors had hoped for in 2023. But secondary investors and IPO lawyers recently told TechCrunch that despite these four successes, macro conditions like the upcoming presidential election and elevated interest rates mean the IPO market won\u2019t fully reopen until 2025. This year is still on track to be better than 2023, and we\u2019ll likely see a few more public filings throughout the year. Companies, including Klarna and Shein , have engaged with bankers and seem close to the line, but their IPO timelines are still murky. For the most part, it may be easier to decipher who isn\u2019t going public this year rather than who is. Some CEOs of late-stage startups have directly stated they won\u2019t IPO in 2024 while other companies have made financial moves that imply a public listing isn\u2019t imminent. Here are some of the venture-backed tech companies we don\u2019t expect to hit the public market this year. Skims Kim Kardashian\u2019s underwear and loungewear brand Skims is heading to the IPO market but not this year. The 5-year-old company, which is valued at nearly $4 billion, was named as an IPO hopeful this year by many investors despite its young age. However, The Information reported that the earliest the company will go is the first half of 2025. Chime Chime, the 12-year-old challenger bank and fintech startup, has been on many investors\u2019 IPO hopefuls list since it pulled its IPO plan in 2022 citing market conditions. The company appears to be moving toward an IPO and, according to The Information, has approached bankers \u2014\u00a0but not for a 2024 listing. It\u2019s worth noting that Chime\u2019s mutual fund backers have marked up the fintech\u2019s valuation 25% in the last six months, according to secondary data platform Caplight, which is a positive reversal after nearly two years of steep decline. CoreWeave New Jersey-based AI company CoreWeave raised one of the largest late-stage venture funding rounds so far this year when it closed on a $1.1 billion Series C round in May. The startup announced an additional $7.5 billion in debt capital a few weeks later. While raising a round like that gives us a hint that CoreWeave won\u2019t IPO this year, The Information has also heard from sources that the company has its 2025 IPO plans in the works . The 7-year-old startup has also seen its valuation rise 42% since its Series C, according to Caplight data, which shows it doesn\u2019t need to rush to the public market and still has room to grow while staying private. Sword Health Al-powered virtual physical therapy startup Sword Health recently signaled that it plans to IPO but not until at least 2025 , \u200b\u200bSword founder and CEO Virg\u00edlio Bento told TechCrunch. The startup just held a tender offer for $100 million of employee shares, in addition to raising $30 million in new equity, at a $3 billion valuation, which is further proof that there is no rush to the public markets. Plaid At an Axios event in March, Plaid\u2019s CEO Zach Perret said the B2B fintech had no plans to IPO in 2024 . This echos what TechCrunch\u2019s own Mary Ann Azevedo reported last October after the company hired a new CFO. Plaid was valued at $13.4 billion in 2021, its most recent valuation. Figma While design unicorn Figma hasn\u2019t directly said it won\u2019t IPO this year, its actions point in that direction. In May, the company held a tender offer to allow existing investors and employees to sell their Figma shares, if they please, on the secondary market. This type of liquidity event does not generally come right before the larger liquidity event of an IPO. The tender offer did value the startup at $12.5 billion, which is lower than the $20 billion Adobe was willing to pay but also higher than the last primary round valuation Figma received \u2014 $10 billion. Stripe Stripe also held a tender offer for its current and former employees earlier this year. In February, the fintech unicorn announced a secondary sale that valued the company at a whopping $65 billion valuation. While this is lower than the $95 billion valuation the company garnered in 2021, the company is building its valuation back up. This is a sign that Stripe will likely look to build that valuation up a bit more before hitting the public market. Databricks AI cloud platform Databricks isn\u2019t likely on the docket for 2024 either \u2014\u00a0perhaps to the dismay of the VC investors who last year predicted it as the first company to go public. The company raised a fresh $500 million in capital last fall in a Series I round that valued the startup at $43 billion. While companies don\u2019t generally raise funding right before a public listing \u2014\u00a0that is part of the IPO process, after all \u2014 the investors they did raise this round from were crossover investors like T. Rowe Price. Those are not the kind of investors that tend to object to IPOs . When market conditions improve, Databricks is in good shape to be one of the first listings of 2025, if they choose. Canva Canva isn\u2019t likely to go public until at least next year and the design startup may very well wait until 2026. Co-founder Cliff Obrecht, the husband of Canva CEO Melanie Perkins, told Startup Daily , an Australian and New Zealand tech publication, in March that an IPO would be at least 12 months away, if not sometime in 2026. Lucky for U.S. investors, though, Obrecht also confirmed that when the startup does look to go public, it will do so in the U.S. TechCrunch is monitoring the late-stage startup and exit markets and will continue to update this article.

        "body": "Knowde, an online marketplace for chemicals and polymers, just closed on a Series C round, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The San Jose-based startup raised $60 million in a round that values it lower than the $500 million valuation it garnered in its most recent round, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. This round values the company at north of 20x ARR, according to a source familiar with the transaction. The round included new investors: Blue Cloud Ventures and Point72 Private Investments in addition to existing backer Sequoia. Knowde declined to comment. The company has now raised more than $150 million in total venture funding. Its most recent round prior to this was a $72 million Series B led by Coatue; it closed in August 2021. Sequoia led the firm\u2019s $14 million Series A round that closed in May 2020. Knowde launched in 2017 to bring the chemical and polymer market online. Co-founder and CEO Ali Amin-Javaheri is the child of a DuPont chemist; he\u2019s spent his entire career in the industry. Prior to starting Knowde, Amin-Javaheri worked at ChemPoint, which also tried to introduce technology to the chemicals market, before pivoting to being a middleman distribution platform. Knowde currently has more than 8,000 chemical suppliers in its marketplace and works with such brands as Unilever, Johnson & Johnson and P&G, among many others."

        "body": "When AI companion startup Friend revealed it had spent $1.8 million on buying the www.friend.com domain name last week, it set off a debate around what exactly branding is worth, and how startups should be spending cash. Founders of other companies like Loom and Public came forward to share stories of their own quests to lock down a domain, but the questions continued rolling in: Did Friend overspend for its domain? Will it really make a difference? Avi Schiffmann, the founder and CEO of Friend, told TechCrunch over email that the purchase has already paid for itself. And there may be a method to the madness, given that buying domain names for millions of dollars isn\u2019t particularly a new thing \u2014 Tesla paid an estimated $10 million over the span of a decade for \u201ctesla.com,\u201d and mortgage startup Better.com paid $1.8 million for its domain in 2015, the year it was founded. And according to some reports , OpenAI apparently paid $11 million for \u201cai.com.\u201d Alex Harris, a co-founder of startup marketing firm Fiat Growth and founding GP at early-stage VC firm Fiat Ventures, told TechCrunch that getting the name, domain and branding right can have a big impact on how a company grows. The right name or domain can help startups be not only easy to find but also easy to remember, Harris said. He added that \u201c.com\u201d domains are king (sorry \u201c.ai\u201d companies) \u2014 and shorter is always better when it comes to names or domains. \u201cIn many cases, the name is critical when there is any kind of word-of-mouth [promotion],\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe name is easy to spell, easy to say. These are some of the things we talk about that are really quite simple, but a lot of people ignore [them].\u201d Olivier Toubia, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School, said one nuance to consider when thinking of a name is how often you want customers to interact with your business. If it\u2019s a consumer product that users will turn to often, or software that businesses will use every day, coming up with something unique and memorable like Google or Twitter could be a smart play. And if a company\u2019s product is something that users turn to less often, or only when they need to, it\u2019s better to choose a name that is generic enough to easily come up on search engines. \u201cIf you [are] a product or service that [people] won\u2019t necessarily use very frequently or maybe when they need you, they will Google or search for you,\u201d Toubia said, pointing out how someone may search for a locksmith if they were locked out of their apartment. And in the case of startups that customers don\u2019t interact with on a daily basis \u2014think healthcare companies \u2014 most of the big ones like Spring Health and Cityblock Health all have \u201chealth\u201d in their name to make it clear what they do, as well as for SEO purposes. Harris feels getting the name and domain right adds a touch of legitimacy to businesses. A professional-sounding name and domain helps people trust a company if they haven\u2019t heard of it before, be they customers, potential hires or even investors. \u201cWe all get emails from [companies] with a super long domain or weird domain extension, and it de-legitimizes it,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIf you have a domain that is desirable, [people] pay attention.\u201d Harris also feels spending $1.8 million on a domain, as Friend did, isn\u2019t as crazy as it may seem at first. He said that if buying that domain helps the company\u2019s business, which he predicts it will, that purchase will pay for itself over time. And a good domain like that can double as solid IP that can be sold if needed. Caution.com Larger companies can probably afford to spend millions on branding, but does it make sense for startups that are still building a product and going to market? Harris and Toubia both warned that there are things to keep in mind here, of course. In Friend\u2019s case, both said the amount of money spent on buying the domain name is only going to be worth it if it isn\u2019t preventing the startup from actually building a product. \u201cThe name is important, but you have to sell and develop a product,\u201d Toubia said. \u201cIf you already burned 70% of the cash and don\u2019t have a product, investors may not be very happy with that. That may hurt your ability to raise [more money] in the future.\u201d There are clear advantages to locking in your branding early on, but companies must also make sure they don\u2019t paint themselves into a corner with a name or branding that could make it hard to pivot later, Toubia said. If a company completely changes its business down the line, or chooses a name that is subject to legal action, that early branding could prove costly. It could also be risky to choose a name that is too similar to another company\u2019s. If the companies are in wildly different sectors and wouldn\u2019t confuse a potential customer, it probably won\u2019t matter. But the stakes change dramatically if a company with a similar name commits fraud or another act that would result in a less-than-ideal association. Even in less drastic terms, if a name is too similar, it could just cause general confusion, Harris said, like in the case of former New York City mayor\u00a0Rudy Giuliani\u2019s press conference at the Four Seasons Total Landscaping a few years ago. Regardless of how Friend\u2019s decision to purchase their costly domain works out, both Harris and Toubia both said the fact that we are talking about their decision to do so shows their strategy might already be working. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like naming a kid,\u201d Harris said. \u201cYou get to the point where you say, I almost don\u2019t care anymore; these five names are fine, just pick one and be done with it. In that moment of frustration, be patient and push through. It is very important. Don\u2019t settle on something because it\u2019s easy, because it\u2019s cheap. Think about the assets available and who you are competing against.\u201d"

        "body": "Farms produce a lot of data. From machines to irrigation systems, farms generate a lot of information that could be helpful to both them and the companies that serve them. Traditionally this data has been siloed across different formats, making it hard to read and build off of. Leaf is trying to change that. New York-based Leaf is looking to build the Plaid of farm data, co-founder and CEO Bailey Stockdale told TechCrunch. The company takes a farm\u2019s unstructured data, standardizes it, and loads it into an application programming interface (API). This allows Leaf customers, who range from crop insurance providers to agtech startups, to better utilize and build off the data. Customers pay for the service based on how many acres their data is harvested from. Stockdale said he got the idea for the company in 2018 when the manager of his family\u2019s farm told him that to decide which day would be best to plant seeds, he would go out at 6 a.m. to stick a thermometer into the ground. If it read 70 degrees, they would plant the seeds, if it didn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t. The anecdote stuck with Stockdale. \u201cAgriculture, it is a funny industry; it is simultaneously extremely sophisticated and totally antiquated,\u201d Stockdale said. \u201cMy family has had a farm in Illinois for over 100 years. In that time, a lot of things have changed but some things haven\u2019t.\u201d He said his first idea was to implement some technology to help the farm choose which crops to plant and when. He knew the farm had loads of data from their tractors and decided to start there, but the data he found, while plentiful, was incredibly difficult to decipher. He was curious how other tech companies were able to make any use of it. \u201cI just started calling people and asking them, \u2018How do you do this?\u2019 And no one had a good answer,\u201d Stockdale said. \u201cI said, \u2018OK, maybe it is time to go find something else to do.\u2019 There is no way anyone can break into this infrastructure; maybe it would be interesting to solve this. If I build this infrastructure layer so they can build these other use cases on top of it, there is a huge range of use cases that need this data.\u201d So Stockdale pivoted and Leaf was launched. He said building the product was tedious, as they had to reverse engineer each data file type separately. Leaf started selling in mid-2021 and now works with more than 80 companies, including agriculture giants like Bayer and Syngenta. The startup just raised a $11.3 million Series A round. Stockdale said that despite the company\u2019s traction, it took a few months of pitching to find investor interest because not many people understood just how bad the farm data problem was. But after four months, Leaf found its people. The round was led by Spero Ventures with participation for existing investors, including S2G Ventures, Radicle Growth and SP Ventures, among others. Stockdale said Leaf is going to put the money toward building out a commercial go-to-market team. He added that he\u2019s been on all of the sales calls for the last six months and that just isn\u2019t sustainable anymore. Leaf will also use the capital to continue improving the product to better respond to new use cases from their customers. One area is improving the quality and accuracy of the data; some of Leaf\u2019s customers are looking to use it as input for AI prediction models surrounding things like when to plant which crops and where or how much they should treat a field with certain fertilizers based on prior years\u2019 data. Leaf also has customers looking to go end to end with their data on Leaf, removing a cloud provider like AWS, something that Stockdale said the company wants to offer. \u201cAgriculture is a really interesting industry in itself because of the paradox of high sophistication and zero sophistication,\u201d Stockdale said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to get in with a lot of these customers and get started; now that we are rolling, we are kind of embedded. It\u2019s a great industry and bringing something new to market is a little bit of a big bet. [Leaf is] an API in a fairly antiquated industry but it\u2019s working.\u201d"

        "body": "Europe is routinely castigated by tech industry observers for having too few \u201cgrowth capital\u201d funds, and, compared to the U.S., that\u2019s true. That said, it is nowhere near nonexistent on this front. To wit: Growth equity investor Kennet of London just announced it has raised \u20ac266 million for its largest fund to date, Kennet VI, which is already being deployed into B2B SaaS companies across Europe. Kennet focuses exclusively on backing established B2B SaaS startups that are founder-owned and either highly capital efficient or fully bootstrapped, meaning they\u2019re built without external capital. A good example of this is the conference networking app Grip, which raised $13 million in 2021, with Kennet leading the round. The Kennet VI fund follows the previous five funds Kennet has run over the last 25 years. Its most recent exit was with Eloomi in January 2024. The learning experience platform was acquired by floated software company Ceridian. Kennet said this generated a 3.1x cash multiple. Earlier (numerous) exits include Nuxeo (a 5x exit), Dext (3.8x), CrossBorder Solutions (6.4x), Rimilia (2.5x), and Impartner (2.6x). Investment from Kennet is typically the first external funding that companies receive and is used to scale and expand internationally, build world-class management teams, and amass strategic value. In an interview with TechCrunch, Hillel Zidel, managing director, Kennet Partners, said: \u201cThis new fund is very consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the prior funds, which is B2B software focused on bootstrapped and capital efficient companies at the growth stage. \u201cWe\u2019re probably the only group with an exclusive focus on this category. And with each client, we just want to do more and more in terms of, you know, being of service to bootstrap founders. The exits we\u2019ve had demonstrate that if you invest in good businesses that have strategic value, you\u2019re not dependent on a particular market cycle to be able to exit successfully.\u201d The Kennet VI fund was raised in partnership with cornerstone investor Edmond de Rothschild Private Equity, which started investing in the fund in 2017. Bpifrance, British Patient Capital and Federated Hermes Private Equity also committed to the fund. There\u2019s been a rise in growth funds in Europe. Earlier this year Index Ventures announced $2.3 billion in new funds, spread across different stages, with $800 million dedicated to venture investment and $1.5 billion set aside for growth- and late-stage companies. Aside from normal venture capital, the often quieter \u201cgrowth capital\u201d sector can frequently see great returns for entrepreneurs who prefer to retain a lot of ownership and control but are also willing to bootstrap over a longer period in order to reach revenues and profits."

        "body": "From golf to fishing to pickleball, outdoor sports and recreation saw a boom during the pandemic. But unlike some pandemic-driven trends (virtual conferences, Zoom happy hours), the interest in outdoor activities has stuck. By the end of 2023, outdoor participation grew to a record 175.8 million people , or 57% of all Americans aged six and older, according to the Outdoor Industry Association. But the influx of interest exposed the lack of innovation in many parts of this industry. From over-the-phone bookings to cash payments to a gear market dominated by legacy brands, the outdoor recreation category was full of opportunity for entrepreneurs. In the past couple of years, entrepreneurs have built SaaS software for hunting and fishing guides. Founders have developed AI-powered companies that find and book golf tee times. Kevin Durant invested in a startup that helps people locate pickleball courts . And the list goes on. VCs, meanwhile, have been interested as well. In 2019, VCs invested $48.60 million into 25 sports tech companies, according to PitchBook . In 2021 that rose to $949.26 million and 53 companies; in 2023, during the VC winter, investments totaled $189.71 million and 43 companies. While that\u2019s a major crash from 2021 (when VC investing was record-breaking across all industries), the dollars invested last year still represent a 290% increase over 2019\u2019s pre-pandemic levels. Online acceleration Benjamin Lazarov, the co-founder and CEO of AnyCreek , a startup building booking and back-end business software for fishing and hunting guides, told TechCrunch that he would never have thought of building his company before the pandemic. But then Lazarov tried to book a fishing guide in Vermont in 2022. He had asked the cashier at a nearby Orvis for some local guide recommendations and she gave him a paper list of seven names to call. As he called and left voicemails, it dawned on him that everything else had moved online during COVID-19, why was he still trying to book a guided fishing trip over the phone? After that he left his role as a regional director of growth at Compass and launched AnyCreek. \u201cMy thought is that had I tried to start this business five years before COVID-19, no way,\u201d Lazarov said. \u201cCOVID-19 definitely accelerated the adoption to more technology. There is a new generation of guides that are tech first, mobile first, they are operating every other part of their life online.\u201d Mallard Bay is another startup bringing hunting and fishing guides online. The Houston, Texas-based company launched in 2019 and saw its site blossom after lockdowns eased in 2021, from 19 guides on the platform to over 100, co-founder and CEO Logan Meaux told TechCrunch. Loop Golf , a startup that automates finding and booking a tee time at a public golf course, was founded as a response to the increase in new golfers making it difficult for existing players to play. Matthew Holder, the co-founder and CEO of Loop Golf, told TechCrunch in June that he got the idea when he realized that the rise in interest in golf that occurred post-pandemic wasn\u2019t going away. \u201cIt became increasingly more difficult to find a tee time,\u201d Holder said. \u201cI\u2019d be spending hours looking at the different options. I got fed up with it and my wife definitely got fed up with it.\u201d Behavior changes When the world was forced to move online, consumers learned to expect to interact with all businesses that way, Lazarov said. People simply don\u2019t want to go back to booking things over the phone, and they want technology to do more for their recreational lives, just as it\u2019s doing in their work and personal lives in other areas. It\u2019s like a restaurant in New York that updated its point of sale system to handle cashless transactions. \u201cThey are never going back,\u201d Lazarov said, because the new POS system \u201chelps them better operate their business. Think of how much more money they can make.\u201d Scott Holloway, a managing partner at Starting Line, and an investor in AnyCreek, said that people, especially younger generations, are increasingly looking to spend more money on experiences than physical things. This trend has been well-documented in numerous surveys dating back to a decade ago . He added that the companies building the tech to power those experience-based transactions are in a smart position. Plus, people often need to buy new gear and equipment to do said new activities. Numerous startups have also popped up to supply gear, clothes and accessories for these new hobbyists. Eastside Golf and Malbon Golf are both venture-backed startups looking to outfit and accessorize new-found golf fans that maybe don\u2019t want to look like 1960\u2019s era Arnold Palmer. Nettie and Recess are startups designing pickleball paddles that don\u2019t look like they came from a retirement community in Florida. Early venture-backed entrants to this category like Hipcamp , a booking platform for campsites, and AutoCamp , a glamping company, showed that there was consumer appetite for innovation in this category years ago. Now, more than 10 years later, Holloway thinks there is still so much entrepreneurs can do. There\u2019s reason to believe he\u2019s right. Rental services for things like canoes, kayaks and stand-up paddleboards still have websites that look like they were built in 2002. Ditto for those offering services for everything from archery to ziplines. Many businesses in the outdoor recreation category could still use some tech help. \u201cThe market is massive,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cAs Marc Andreessen famously said, \u2018software is eating the world,\u2019 but this is one of the last pieces of consumer spend that software hasn\u2019t eaten. Consumers are demanding it. It\u2019s a massive market opportunity to ride that wave.\u201d This piece has been updated to correct AnyCreek\u2019s founding story."

        "body": "The founder of once-hyped crypto startup BitClout is facing trouble. On Tuesday, the SEC charged BitClout founder Nader Al-Naji with fraud and unregistered offering of securities, claiming he used a pseudonymous identity to avoid regulatory scrutiny while he raised over $257 million in cryptocurrency. BitClout, a decentralized social media platform, raised from a who\u2019s-who of firms, like a16z, Sequoia, Chamath Palihapitiya\u2019s Social Capital, Coinbase Ventures and Winklevoss Capital. Many of these big name investors were in at the company\u2019s roughly $7 million seed round, with Sequoia investing $1 million and a16z investing $3 million, according to sources close to the seed round at the time. The SEC complaint alleges that Al-Naji, known by his online pseudonym \u201cDiamondHands,\u201d told investors that proceeds from the platform\u2019s token, BTCLT, would not be used to pay himself or employees. But the SEC alleges that he spent over $7 million on personal expenses, like a Beverly Hills mansion and gifts for his family. Al-Naji did not respond to a request for comment. A source close to Al-Naji said the mansion was used for business purposes, with several BitClout employees living there and throwing company-sponsored events at the home. The complaint is the latest for a company that has been no stranger to controversy from the start. In 2021 when it was launched, BitClout was intended to be a social crypto-exchange where users bought and sold tokens based on people\u2019s reputations. It made waves and earned criticism by scraping 15,000 profiles from the company then known as Twitter and attaching crypto tokens to celebrities. It essentially created a stock market for famous people, with the price of the tokens rising and falling based on how popular the person was. The public \u2013 and legal \u2014 backlash was swift. Brandon Curtis, cofounder of crypto company Rio Network, hit Al-Naji with a cease-and-desist letter, saying BitClout used his likeness without consent. Lee Hsien Loong, the former Prime Minister of Singapore, even made a public plea asking for his BitClout profile to be removed. \u201cIt is misleading and done without my permission,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. At the time, many wondered why such esteemed firms had backed such a polarizing concept. Sources close to the company explained that, in crypto circles, Al-Naji had earned goodwill after his previous company, Basis. In 2018, the Princeton grad had raised a whopping $140 million to create a stablecoin. But shortly after Al-Naji realized the regulatory environment was too inhospitable to crypto and he decided to return the money, these sources said. Investors got back about 93 cents on the dollar, according to a person close to Al-Naji. So, in early 2021, when Al-Naji approached investors with a new idea, they were inclined to give him a second chance. According to sources close to the company, Al-Naji raised his seed round on the broad pitch of a decentralized social media platform, with no emphasis on the social stock market. But then, in April, Al-Naji intended to quietly test the stock market feature, locking it behind a password-protected webpage. The password promptly leaked and the feature went viral, suddenly becoming a huge focal point for Al-Naji. This upset several investors, according to multiple sources. The company eventually steered back to its original pitch, focusing instead on its DeSo Blockchain, a blockchain \u201cbuilt specifically for decentralizing social networks,\u201d according to the BitClout website. Still, immediately after the scraping brouhaha, plenty of tech bigwigs publicly defended BitClout. Investors like a16z\u2019s Andrew Chen, Michael Arrington and angel investor Shaan Puri poured thousands into buying tokens on the platform. Chen posted on BitClout about a month after its launch, writing about how the app has a \u201creally interesting approach\u201d by incentivizing users with financial rewards. And, in a post by Sequoia Capital\u2019s Shaun Maguire, the investor praised Al-Naji\u2019s \u201ctransformative vision\u201d and called BitClout \u201cinstantly electrifying.\u201d The polarization among those angry at being \u201ctraded\u201d on BitClout without their permission and those defending the startup was made even more complicated by the fact that there wasn\u2019t a CEO to speak to on behalf of the company. Al-Naji\u2019s hidden identity is one of the key tenants of the SEC\u2019s complaint, which claims that he made BitClout appear like there was \u201cno company behind it \u2026 just coins and code,\u201d when he allegedly was, the commission claims, pocketing millions in profit. \u201cAl-Naji attempted to evade the federal securities laws and defraud the investing public, mistakenly believing that \u2018being \u2018fake\u201d decentralized generally confuses regulators and deters them from going after you,\u2019\u201d said Gurbir S.

Founded in 1996, Rediff rode the initial dot-com wave to become one of India\u2019s leading web portals, offering email, news and e-commerce services. At its peak, Rediff was valued at over $600 million on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It also drove some of the largest traffic in India, climbing at least up to the 12th spot, according to brokerage house Jefferies. A Credit Suisse research note from 2001 about Rediff Image Credits: Screenshot: Manish Singh/TechCrunch The company struggled to adapt to the evolving digital landscape in the 2000s and 2010s. As social media platforms and specialized e-commerce sites gained prominence, Rediff\u2019s broad portal model became increasingly obsolete. Despite attempts to diversify its offerings, it failed to compete effectively against more nimble rivals and eventually delisted from Nasdaq. Infibeam said Friday that Rediff still drives more than 55 million visits each month. It plans to tap Rediff\u2019s user base to cross-sell financial products, including loans, insurance and investment advisory. Rediff reported $4 million in revenue in the financial year ending in March."

        "body": "The fundraising environment is challenging for emerging managers , defined as VC firms raising their first through third time. But Katie Jacobs Stanton, a former head of media at Twitter who founded Moxxie Ventures in 2019, said that she had a much easier time than she was expecting when raising funds for her third time. Moxxie, which invests in pre-seed and seed startups, announced on Tuesday that it closed a $95 million third fund, surpassing its target of $85 million. When the firm started fundraising, Stanton and general partner Alex Roetter, who was an SVP of engineering at Twitter, told limited partners that they didn\u2019t intend to start deploying the capital until 2025. Luckily for them, their LPs, which include fund-of-funds Cendana Capital and Accolade Partners, the Nature Conservancy, the outsourced CIO Global Endowment Management, and several universities, were eager to back the firm. Cendana founder Michael Kim described Stanton\u2019s network as one of the deepest and widest among seed-stage investors. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take us as long as we thought to fundraise. We\u2019re really happy about that, but you never know,\u201d Stanton said. Although the five-year-old firm still hasn\u2019t realized any meaningful exits, Stanton\u2019s pre-Moxxie personal investing record through investment collective #Angels , which she co-founded with other female Twitter executives and alums, shows her investment prowess. She previously backed Carta, Coinbase and Airtable. The success of Moxxie\u2019s portfolio companies has been more modest so far. When asked to highlight some companies, Stanton has pointed to startups like Certn, an identity verification company that last year raised an $80 million Series B, and Spellbook, an AI co-pilot for drafting legal contracts, which in January scored a $20 million Series A led by Innovia. Moxxie, whose name was inspired by the synonym for courage with an extra X for the female chromosome, has been on a mission of investing in underrepresented founders since its debut $25 million fund . Today, about a third of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies are led by female founders and about a half have been founded by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), according to Stanton. While the firm considers itself a generalist investor, it gravitates toward backing companies in health tech, climate tech, SaaS, and AI applications and has recently invested in a couple of robotics startups, including Jacobi Robotics , which is developing an AI-powered motion-planning technology. Moxxie\u2019s median check size is $1.5 million, and the firm aims to acquire roughly 10% of each startup when making its initial investment. Stanton, who worked in the Obama administration during his first term, continues to be vocal about politics, the 2024 presidential election, and how VCs are being more public about their political preferences. She said that the current political transparency in the investing community is a good thing. In a world where capital remains a commodity, it can help founders decide who to choose as their backers because it shows \u201cwho can add value and who has values.\u201d"

        "body": "Alex Cook, a partner at Tiger Global who oversaw some of its largest fintech investments and India deals, is departing the firm after a tenure of nearly seven years, three people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Cook has briefed multiple people around him about his departure news in recent days, although he hasn\u2019t explained why he was leaving. The sources requested anonymity as the conversations were private. His departure adds to high-profile shifts within Tiger Global. Scott Shleifer, who previously led the firm\u2019s private equity business, moved to a senior advisory role last year . John Curtius, who led the firm\u2019s software investments, left in late 2022 . Cook anchored many fintech deals for Tiger Global, including TradingView, TrueLayer, Scalapay, Xendit, Selfbook, Fazz and Refyne. The median size of his deals were about $35 million whereas the median valuation stood at north of $250 million, according to PitchBook. The departure has come as a surprise to at least some founders. Cook spoke frequently \u2014 multiple times a week \u2014 to founders, according to some accounts. He assumed responsibility for managing relationships with some portfolio startups previously overseen by Shleifer, according to people familiar with the matter. Tiger Global declined to comment. Cook\u2019s focus extended significantly to emerging markets, particularly India, where he frequently visited and met with founders in person. In July 2022, for instance, he told founders in Bengaluru, India, that Tiger Global was about to slow its pace of investments , TechCrunch reported at the time. This development comes at a challenging time for the venture industry. Tiger Global raised $2.2 billion for its latest VC fund, its smallest fundraising effort in a decade and a stark contrast to its previous years of robust investor demand that had allowed the New York-based giant to raise increasingly larger funds, including its record $12.7 billion fund. At $2.2 billion, to be sure, Tiger Global is still operating one of the largest funds. Amid this difficult fundraising climate, fueled by investor caution towards VC and private equity investments due to declining returns, Tiger Global announced a significant leadership change in November, with founder Chase Coleman assuming the role of venture chief from Shleifer. Coleman has taken on the responsibility of managing relationships with certain key portfolio startups globally, according to people familiar with the matter."

        "body": "When Keith Rabois announced he was leaving Founders Fund to return to Khosla Ventures in January, it came as a shock to many in the venture capital ecosystem \u2014 and not just because Rabois is a big name in the industry. It was surprising because unlike in many other fields, venture capitalists don\u2019t traditionally move around very much \u2014 especially those who reach the partner or general partner level as Rabois had. VC funds have 10-year life cycles and partners have good reason to stay that course. In some instances, they may be a \u201ckey man\u201d on a firm\u2019s fund, meaning that if they leave, the fund\u2019s LPs have the right to pull their capital out if they choose. Many partners and GPs also have some of their own money invested in their firms\u2019 funds, which gives them further reason to stick around. So, while big-name investor moves in venture capital aren\u2019t common, they seem to have become so in recent months. So far this year, there have been notable instances of investors returning to old firms, striking out on their own or taking a pause from investing entirely. Here\u2019s who we know of so far: July After nearly seven years, Alex Cook is getting ready to leave Tiger Global, sources familiar with the matter tell TechCrunch. While at Tiger Global, Cook led deals including TradingView, Scalapay and TrueLayer, among others. Prior to Tiger Global, Cook worked at Apollo. Bessemer Venture Partners announced it added Lauri Moore as a partner on July 22. Moore was previously a partner at Foundation Capital for two years and an operator at LinkedIn before that. Moore will be focused on early-stage investments in sectors including data, AI and developer tools. On July 17, DCVC announced it had brought on Milo Werner as a general partner to lead the firm\u2019s climate investing practice. The firm is currently raising its first dedicated climate fund . Werner was most recently a general partner at Engine Ventures for two and a half years. Werner was a partner at Ajax Strategies prior to that. Anne Lee Skates announced on July 11 that she had left Andreessen Horowitz where she had been a partner on the consumer team since 2019. She added that she\u2019s off to do her \u201clife\u2019s work\u201d and will post more about her future plans soon. At Andreessen, she backed companies including Whatnot, Kindred and Prisms, among others. June On June 17, Spencer Peterson announced that he\u2019d left Bedrock, where he served as partner for five years, to become a general partner at Coatue. Peterson is an investor in companies including OpenAI and Rippling, among others. Amanda \u201cRobby\u201d Robson announced her departure from Cowboy Ventures in a LinkedIn post in early June. Robson had been at Cowboy Ventures since October 2019 and at Norwest Venture Partners for three years prior to that. Robson plans to launch a fund of her own. May Serena Ventures founding partner Alison Stillman announced she\u2019d stepped back from the firm on May 14 after a nearly six-year run working with tennis star Serena Williams. Stillman did not announce her next step. Terri Burns announced on May 13 that she was launching a new venture firm called Type Capital. Burns was previously the first Black woman partner at GV and left the firm back in 2022. Her new fund will focus on pre-seed and seed-stage startups. Last week TechCrunch scooped that Fika Ventures co-founder Eva Ho was going to transition out of the firm after Fika finished deploying its current fund. Ho is stepping back for personal reasons. The move was confirmed by the firm in a blog post on May 9. On May 9, Alison Lange Engel announced she was taking on the role of CEO at Ceros, an AI-powered design company. Lange Engel left Greycroft in December, where she had been a partner since 2019, to take the role. After 15 years, Vic Singh announced on X that he was stepping down from Eniac Ventures on May 1. Singh helped launch the firm in 2009 and is planning to launch a new firm of his own. April On April 30, Ethan Kurzweil announced he was leaving his role as partner at Bessemer Venture Partners after 16 years. Kurzweil will be launching an early-stage-focused investment firm, according to reporting from Axios . Kurzweil will launch the firm with Kristina Shen , who left Andreessen Horowitz after four years on March 29, and Mark Goldberg, who left Index Ventures after eight years last fall. On April 1, Christina Farr announced that she\u2019d be leaving OMERS Ventures, where she has served as a principal investor and the lead of the firm\u2019s health tech practice since December 2020. Farr announced on X that she\u2019d be working on her health tech newsletter, writing a book focused on the power that storytelling can have on businesses, and consulting health tech founders. March After six years as a partner at Accel, Ethan Choi announced that he\u2019d be leaving the firm to head to Khosla Ventures in March. Choi will be focused on growth-stage investing at his new firm and has backed such companies as Klaviyo, Pismo and 1Password. While many of the recent VC moves have been by folks looking to start something new, or take on a different opportunity, not all of them have been. On March 13, Chamath Palihapitiya\u2019s Social Capital announced that it fired partners Jay Zaveri and Ravi Tanuku . Bloomberg reported that this was due to a matter involving raising money for AI startup Groq. Rabois was not the only person looking to boomerang back to an old haunt in this recent rise of investor reshuffling. On March 5, Miles Grimshaw announced that he\u2019d be returning to Thrive Capital as a general partner after serving the same position at Benchmark Capital for three years. Grimshaw originally started at Thrive Capital in 2013 and has backed such companies as Airtable, Lattice, and Monzo, among others. While transitioning from operator to VC is a common career progression in the startup ecosystem, it isn\u2019t for everybody. On March 4, Sam Blond announced he had come to that conclusion and would be leaving Founders Fund, where he had been a partner for about 18 months. Blond said he would return to operating and has held roles at companies such as Brex, Zenefits and EchoSign. January After 12 years at Andreessen Horowitz, Connie Chan announced she was leaving the firm on January 23. Chan had served as one of the firm\u2019s general partners the last five years and has backed companies such as Cider, KoBold and Whatnot.

        "body": "Boston-based Flint Capital just closed its third fund at $160 million, four times the amount of its initial 2013 fund. The capital will be split evenly between early and late stage investments, with the firm doubling down on IT, cybersecurity, fintech and digital health startups. Its success is in large part because of a unique strategy over who its courts as limited partner investors. The firm is over a decade old, founded by partner Dmitry Smirnov, who was previously CEO of Russia-based investment firm FINAM Global. He immediately made an unorthodox decision: instead of pursuing traditional LPs like pension funds or endowments, he sought out IT entrepreneurs, believing they would want a front row seat to the next generation of technology. Sergey Gribov, one of Flint\u2019s three partners, said the firm also has a global mandate and invests strongly in Europe and Israel \u2014 as long as the startup has its eyes on expanding into the US. \u201cWe don\u2019t really care where physically the team is located, as long as we go off to the US market,\u201d he said. That\u2019s been a good strategy for Flint: the firm has backed identity verification startup Socure , last valued at $4.5 billion, adoption platform WalkMe , which was acquired by SAP for $1.5 billion, and Flo, the women\u2019s health app recently valued at over $1 billion. For this latest fund, partner Andrew Gershfeld highlighted that several investors were actually founders that Flint backed years ago. He gave the example of Nir Giller and Omer Schneider, the founders of CyberX, a cybersecurity company that Microsoft acquired in 2020. For Gershfeld, founders like these reinvesting their profits into Flint was a sign \u201cthat we were doing something right.\u201d Flint\u2019s successful fundraise is a vote of confidence amongst a dire fundraising atmosphere for smaller, or younger emerging funds. This year, funding for venture firms is the lowest it\u2019s been since 2019, and, of the few that have secured capital, established firms are taking a bigger and bigger cut of the pie, according to the Q2 2024 Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor. It took the Flint partners 18 months to fundraise and, while the fund was anchored by previous investors, they felt the sluggishness of the current market. \u201cThe conversion from that first conversation into becoming a limited partner dropped during this year,\u201d Gershfeld said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact \u2013 we can\u2019t say that it is not the case.\u201d The fundraise is particularly impressive as the partners have spent the last year helping their Israeli startups, like Cynomi and Sensi.AI, fundraise throughout the war in Gaza. Gribov, who regularly travels to Israel, recalled video-chatting with founders decked out in combat gear, or coaching companies who had portions of their workforce pulled into the military. His efforts paid off: Sensi.AI, a digital health startup, closed its $31 million Series B in late June. Gribov said that seeing these companies thrive despite the global conflict made him more confident than ever in Flint\u2019s global mandate. \u201cA lot of companies continued to deliver and even outperform,\u201d he said."

        "body": "More than 100 VCs, including Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla and Mark Cuban have pledged to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Mobilizing under the group VCsForKamala , the VCs are also soliciting donations for Harris\u2019 campaign. But the organizers say the effort isn\u2019t meant to align with any one political party. According to the group\u2019s website, signing on is a commitment to \u201cstrong, trustworthy institutions.\u201d \u201cWe believe that strong, trustworthy institutions are a feature, not a bug, and that our industry \u2014 and every other industry \u2014 would collapse without them,\u201d a statement on the VCsForKamala site reads. \u201cThat is what\u2019s at stake in this election. Everything else, we can solve through constructive dialogue with political leaders and institutions willing to talk to us.\u201d VCsForKamala, along with recent open-letter tech worker campaigns like Tech for Kamala, aim to push back against the notion that Silicon Valley has largely embraced ormer President Donald J. Trump. Over the past few weeks, Tesla and X head Elon Musk and investors Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and David Sacks have endorsed Trump , the Republican presidential nominee. Musk created a new pro-Trump super PAC, and Sacks spoke at the Republican National Convention . The billionaire\u00a0Winklevoss\u00a0twins, founders of cryptocurrency company Gemini, also donated to Trump\u2019s campaign (in bitcoin). Trump\u2019s Silicon Valley base argues that the Republican party \u2014 and Trump himself \u2014 are generally more favorable to the startup ecosystem. Andreessen and Horowitz have said that they believe, for example, that President Joe Biden and his administration have stifled tech businesses through overregulation and potentially needless taxation, and that their policies threaten to slow gains in the AI and crypto spaces. Harris has held varying positions on tech regulation as California\u2019s attorney general, in the U.S. Senate, and as VP. In 2019, as a state senator, she advocated for a breakup of Meta (then Facebook). And last year, she hosted four tech CEOs \u2014 Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai \u2014 at the White House \u201cto share concerns about the risks associated with AI.\u201d Harris has at different times in her career drawn praise and financial support from tech leaders such as Box CEO Aaron Levi, Marc Benioff, Sheryl Sandberg and Jony Ive.\u00a0Hoffman, Laurene Powell Jobs and venture capitalist John Doerr are among those who backed Harris\u2019 last presidential bid that ended in December 2019, when she dropped out of the race to endorse Biden. Harris and her allies, looking to muster support among Silicon Valley elite who haven\u2019t cast their lot, have launched a blitz of behind-the-scene lobbying campaigns. According to The New York Times, Harris is planning a fundraising trip in the San Francisco Bay Area as soon as next month. This has proven to be a winning strategy so far. Per NBC, Harris is on track to raise over $100 million from tech donors, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, across her campaign, PACs and so-called \u201cdark money\u201d groups."
