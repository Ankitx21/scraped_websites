We continue to expand our community engagement and contributions with existing partners, including teaming up with\nNevada Gold Mines\nto provide funding for an oncology infusion center in\nElko, Nevada\n.\nGMT Updates\nOn\nJune 20, 2024\n, the Government of\nCanada\nenacted the Global Minimum Tax Act (\"GMTA\"), which implements key measures of the OECD's Pillar Two GMT in\nCanada\nand includes the introduction of a 15% GMT that applies to large multinational enterprise groups with global consolidated revenues over \u20ac750 million.\nIn\nMay 2024\n, the Government of\nBarbados\nenacted legislation to implement tax measures also in response to the OECD's Pillar Two global minimum tax initiative. The measures include an increase of the\nBarbados\ncorporate tax rate to 9% and \u00a0the introduction of a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax, which, together, aim to ensure that the\nBarbados\neffective tax rate payable by an entity subject to Pillar Two is at least 15% for tax years beginning on or after\nJanuary 1, 2024\n.\nAs a result of these changes, the Company recognized an additional\n$69.8 million\nof income tax expense in Q2 2024, of which\n$23.9 million\nis current tax expense and\n$45.9 million\nis deferred tax expense.\nFor purposes of computing Adjusted Net Income\n2\nfor Q2 2024 and H1 2024, we have adjusted amounts which were not related to the respective periods so that users may understand what net income would have been had it only included income tax expense related to income earned in the current periods. Please refer to the reconciliation provided at the end of this news release or to our Q2 2024 MD&A for further details.\nPortfolio Additions\nAcquisition of Royalty on Yanacocha Operations:\nSubsequent to quarter-end, on\nAugust 13, 2024\n, we acquired from Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Minas Buenaventura (\"Buenaventura\") and its subsidiary, an existing 1.8% NSR on all minerals covering Newmont's Yanacocha mine and adjacent mineral properties, including Conga, located in\nPeru\n. Consideration for the Yanacocha royalty consists of\n$210 million\npaid in cash on closing, plus a contingent payment of\n$15 million\npayable in Franco-Nevada common shares payable upon the Conga project achieving commercial production. Franco-Nevada will also hold a right of first refusal on the sale by\nBuenaventura\nof certain of their royalty interests, including incremental royalties on Conga and other deposits. The acquisition of the Yanacocha Royalty is effective\nJuly 1, 2024\n, and initial contributions to Franco-Nevada are expected in Q3 2024. Newmont's guidance anticipates production of 290,000 gold ounces for 2024.\nAcquisition of Gold Stream on Cascabel Copper-Gold Project:\nAs previously announced, subsequent to quarter-end, our wholly owned subsidiary, Franco-Nevada (\nBarbados\n) Corporation (\"FNB\") acquired a gold stream from SolGold with reference to production from the Cascabel project located in\nEcuador\n. FNB has partnered with Osisko Gold Royalties' subsidiary, Osisko Bermuda Limited (\"Osisko\"), to provide a syndicated financing package on a 70%/30% basis. FNB will provide a total of\n$525 million\nand Osisko a total of\n$225 million\nfor a total combined funding of\n$750 million\n, consisting of\n$100 million\nin pre-construction funding and\n$650 million\ntowards construction once the project is fully funded and further derisked. Please refer to our news release dated\nJuly 15, 2024\nfor further details.\nTerm Loan with EMX Royalty Corporation:\nOn\nJune 19, 2024\n, we entered into a term loan agreement with EMX of\n$35 million\n. The EMX Term Loan was funded subsequent to quarter-end, on\nAugust 9, 2024\n.\nPrivate Placement with G Mining Ventures:\nOn\nJuly 12, 2024\n, we completed a private placement of\n$25 million\nwith G Mining Ventures at a price of\nC$2.279\nper share. La Mancha Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. completed a concurrent\n$25 million\nprivate placement with total proceeds to G Mining of\n$50 million\n. The placement is related to G Mining Ventures' business combination with Reunion Gold and advancement of the Oko West gold development project in\nGuyana\n.\nTerm Loan with SolGold:\nOn\nMay 13, 2024\n, we provided a\n$10 million\nterm loan to SolGold plc. The term loan was repaid subsequent to quarter-end, on\nJuly 17, 2024\n.\nTerm Loan with G Mining Ventures:\nOn\nApril 19, 2024\n, we funded a second and final draw of\n$33 million\nunder our term loan commitment to G Mining Ventures, thereby fulfilling our\n$75\nterm loan commitment. The term loan is part of a financing package we provided to G Mining Ventures in\nJuly 2022\nin connection with the Tocantinzinho gold project, in\nBrazil\n.\nFinancing Package with Scottie Resources:\nOn\nApril 15, 2024\n, we acquired a 2.0% gross production royalty on all minerals produced on Scottie Resources Corp.'s (\"Scottie\") claims in the Stewart Mining Camp in the Golden Triangle in\nBritish Columbia, Canada\n, for a purchase price of\n$5.9 million\n(\nC$8.1 million\n). Additionally, we acquired 5,422,994 common shares of Scottie for an aggregate of\n$0.7 million\n(\nC$1.0 million\n).\nQ2 2024 Portfolio Updates\nPrecious Metal assets:\nGEOs sold from our Precious Metal assets were 82,350, compared to 132,033 GEOs in Q2 2023. Lower contributions from Cobre Panama, Antapaccay and\nCandelaria\nwere partly offset by higher GEO sales from Condestable, MWS and newly constructed mines.\nSouth America\n:\nCandelaria\n(gold and silver stream)\n\u2013 GEOs delivered and sold in Q2 2024 were lower than those sold in Q2 2023. During the quarter, mining rates were impacted by the interface of the open pit and historic underground mining stopes, requiring more stockpiled ore to be processed which reduced grades and recoveries. With access to higher grade ore anticipated in the second half of 2024, Lundin Mining anticipates stronger production in H2 2024 and have maintained their production guidance for\nCandelaria\n.\nAntapaccay\n(gold and silver stream)\n\u2013 GEOs delivered and sold were lower in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023. Mine scheduling was adjusted in part due to a geotechnical event which temporarily limited pit access, resulting in lower production in H1. Glencore anticipates stronger production in H2 2024. Deliveries to Franco-Nevada, which may vary from production levels due to the timing of shipments, are expected to be within our initial expectations for 2024 of 50,000 to 60,000 GEOs.\nAntamina\n(22.5% silver stream)\n\u2013 GEOs delivered and sold were lower in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023 as mining is occurring in areas with lower silver grades as anticipated in the life of mine plan.\nCondestable\n(gold and silver stream)\n\u2013 We sold 6,149 GEOs in Q2 2024, compared to 3,043 GEOs sold Q2 2023. GEO sold in the current period included ounces delivered late in Q1 2024 and held in inventory at\nMarch 31, 2024\n.\nTocantinzinho\n(gold stream)\n\u2013 On\nJuly 9, 2024\n, G Mining Ventures announced it poured first gold and that it remained on track for commercial production in H2 2024. Franco-Nevada received its first deliveries from Tocantinzinho at the end of\nJuly 2024\n. According to the 2022 feasibility study, the project is expected to produce an average of 196,000 ounces of gold annually for the first five years.\nSalares Norte\n(\n1-\n2% royalties)\n\u2013 During the quarter, Franco-Nevada received its first royalty payment from Salares Norte, where gold-silver dor\u00e9 was first poured on\nMarch 28, 2024\n. Commissioning and ramp-up of the project have been impacted by earlier than planned winter conditions. Gold Fields revised its 2024 gold equivalent production to between 90,000 and 180,000 ounces (previously between 220,000 and 240,000 ounces).\nPosse (Mara Rosa)\n(1% royalty)\n\u2013 Hochschild Mining announced that the Mara Rosa mine reached commercial production in\nmid-May 2024\nand that the processing plant has already reached nominal capacity of 7,000 tonnes per day. Optimisation initiatives are in place to reach stable throughput of 8,000 tonnes per day.\nCascabel\n(gold stream and 1% royalty)\n\u2013 In\nJune 2024\n, SolGold announced the signing of an exploitation contract with the government of\nEcuador\nwhich establishes key legal and financial terms required for the development of the Cascabel project.\nCentral America\n&\nMexico\n:\nCobre Panama\n(gold and silver stream)\n\u2013 Production at Cobre Panama has been halted since\nNovember 2023\nwith mining activities currently on preservation and safe management. On\nJuly 1, 2024\n, the new president of\nPanama\n, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, was inaugurated into office. In his inauguration speech, President Mulino announced that the Government of\nPanama\nwill conduct, with international experts, a strict environmental audit of the Cobre Panama mine.\nGuadalupe-Palmarejo\n(50% gold stream)\n\u2013 GEOs sold from Guadalupe-Palmarejo in Q2 2024 were relatively consistent with those sold in Q2 2023.\nU.S.:\nGoldstrike\n(2-4% royalties & 2.4-6% NPI)\n\u2013 GEOs from our Goldstrike royalties increased in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023 due to more open pit stockpile tons being processed and a greater proportion of underground production taking place on royalty ground.\nStillwater\n(5% royalty)\n\u2013 GEOs from our\nStillwater\nroyalty decreased in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023 as the decline in PGM prices more than offset higher production at the mine. In\nJuly 2024\n, Sibanye-Stillwater reported that its US PGM operations had been impacted by a cyber-attack but that it expected to promptly resume full operations, with accumulated stockpiles expected to be processed in due course.\nBald Mountain\n(0.875-5% royalties)\n\u2013 GEOs from our Bald Mountain royalties were higher in Q2 2024 than in Q2 2023 due to mine sequencing.\nMarigold\n(0.5-5% royalties)\n\u2013 GEOs from our Marigold royalties were lower in Q2 2024 than in Q2 2023 as production is taking place on ground that carries a lower royalty rate. Production is anticipated to progress to higher royalty rate ground in 2027 through the end of the current mine life.\nCanada\n:\nDetour Lake\n(2% royalty)\n\u2013 In\nJune 2024\n, Agnico Eagle released the results of a technical study reflecting the potential for a concurrent underground operation at Detour Lake that would increase annual production to approximately one million ounces for 14 years starting in 2030. Agnico Eagle has also approved the development of a two-kilometre exploration ramp to collect a bulk sample and to facilitate infill and expansion drilling of the current underground mineral resource.\nHemlo\n(3% royalty & 50% NPI)\n\u2013 GEOs from our\nHemlo\nroyalties were lower than in Q2 2023 reflecting higher underground mining costs. Barrick anticipates production at\nHemlo\nto improve relative to 2023, where production was impacted by interruptions to the underground operations.\nMacassa (\nKirkland Lake\n)\n(1.5-5.5% royalty & 20% NPI) \u2013\nGEOs from Macassa were higher in Q2 2024 than in Q2 2023 due an increase in production. Throughput was higher in the quarter as a result of increased productivity from a larger workforce, new ventilation structure, and improved equipment availability, and the addition of ore sourced from the Near Surface deposit, partially offset by lower grades.\nMagino\n(3% royalty)\nand Island Gold (\n0.62% royalty)\n\u2013\nAlamos\ncompleted the acquisition of the Magino mine in\nJuly 2024\n. The transaction is expected to result in substantial synergies through shared infrastructure between the adjacent Magino and Island Gold mines.\nAlamos\nhas noted potential longer-term upside through a single optimized milling complex at Magino with an expansion to between 15,000 and 20,000 tonnes per day.\nGreenstone\n(3% royalty)\n\u2013 During the quarter, Franco-Nevada received its first royalty payment from Greenstone. Equinox Gold announced that its 100% owned Greenstone mine achieved its inaugural gold pour on schedule on\nMay 22, 2024\n, with commercial production expected by the end of Q3 2024. Greenstone is expected to produce between 175,000 and 205,000 gold ounces in 2024, and average annual production of approximately 400,000 gold ounces for the first five years.\nCanadian\nMalartic\n(1.5% royalty)\n\u2013 Agnico Eagle reported that ramp development continued to exceed target, reaching the third production level of East Gouldie in Q2 2024. Exploration drilling continued to return positive results to the east and west of the existing East Gouldie mineral resources, demonstrating the potential to add inferred mineral resources.\nValentine Gold\n(3% royalty)\n\u2013 Calibre Mining announced a 100,000-metre resource expansion and discovery drill program at the Valentine Gold project. Production is expected to commence in Q2 2025 and average 195,000 gold ounces per year over an initial mine life of 12 years.\nRest of World:\nMWS\n(25% stream)\n\u2013 GEOs delivered and sold from our MWS stream were higher than in Q2 2023 reflecting an increase in tonnes processed and higher recoveries. We continue to anticipate the stream reaching its cap of 312,500 ounces in Q4 2024.\nSubika (Ahafo)\n(2% royalty)\n\u2013 GEOs from our Subika (Ahafo) royalty were higher than in Q2 2023 as production at Subika increased due to higher open pit grade and stronger underground mining rates.\nS\u00e9gu\u00e9la\n(0.6% royalty)\n\u2013 Fortuna reported that production during the quarter was impacted by intermittent power outages, largely mitigated by higher grade feed and the mill operating above nameplate capacity.\nDiversified assets:\nOur Diversified assets, primarily comprising our Iron Ore and Energy interests, generated\n$64.6 million\nin revenue, down from\n$70.7 million\nin Q2 2023.\nIron Ore:\nVale Royalty\n(iron ore royalty)\n\u2013 Revenue from the Vale royalty was relatively consistent with Q2 2023. While the Northern System benefited from record production at S11D, the impact was offset by lower production at Serra Norte and higher estimated shipping cost deductions.\nLIORC \u2013 LIORC declared a cash dividend of\nC$1.10\nper common share in the current period, compared to\nC$0.65\nin Q2 2023. Production from Iron Ore Company of\nCanada\nwas higher when compared to the prior year period which was impacted by wildfires in\nNorthern Quebec\n.\nCaserones\n(0.517% effective NSR)\n\u2013 GEOs from our interest in Caserones were lower in Q2 2024 than in Q2 2023 in part due to our lower effective NSR interest in the current period. In\nJanuary 2024\n, EMX exercised an option to acquire 0.0531% of our NSR, such that we now own a 0.517% effective NSR, compared to 0.5701% in Q2 2023.\nEnergy:\nU.S.\n(various royalty rates)\n\u2013 Revenue from our U.S. Energy interests decreased compared to Q2 2023. While revenue from our oil assets was consistent with the prior year, revenue from our gas assets declined. Contribution from our new Haynesville gas acquisition was offset by lower realized gas prices and volumes at our existing Haynesville assets. Revenue in the prior year period had also included\n$7.0 million\nin catch-up royalty payments related to new wells in the Permian Basin.\nCanada\n(various royalty rates)\n\u2013 Revenue from our Canadian Energy interests was higher than in Q2 2023. Production at our Orion asset increased relative to the prior year period, and our Weyburn NRI benefited from higher realized prices and lower expenses.\nDividend Declaration\nFranco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of\nUS$0.36\nper share. The dividend will be paid on\nSeptember 26, 2024\n, to shareholders of record on\nSeptember 12, 2024\n(the \"Record Date\").

GEOs are estimated on a gross basis for NSRs and, in the case of stream ounces, before the payment of the per ounce contractual price paid by the Company. For NPI royalties, GEOs are calculated taking into account the NPI economics. Silver, platinum, palladium, iron ore, oil, gas and other commodities are converted to GEOs by dividing associated revenue, which includes settlement adjustments, by the relevant gold price. The price used in the computation of GEOs varies depending on the royalty or stream agreement of each particular asset, which may make reference to the market price realized by the operator, or the average price for the month, quarter, or year in which the commodity was produced or sold. For Q2 2024, the average commodity prices were as follows:\n$2,338\n/oz gold (Q2 2023 -\n$1,978\n),\n$28.86\n/oz silver (Q2 2023 -\n$24.18\n),\n$981\n/oz platinum (Q2 2023 -\n$1,028\n) and\n$972\n/oz palladium (Q2 2023 -\n$1,449\n),\n$110\n/t Fe 62% CFR China (Q2 2023 -\n$112\n),\n$80.57\n/bbl WTI oil (Q2 2023 -\n$73.78\n) and\n$2.34\n/mcf Henry Hub natural gas (Q2 2023 -\n$2.32\n). For H1 2024 prices, the average commodity prices were as follows:\n$2,205\n/oz gold (H1 2023 -\n$1,933\n),\n$26.11\n/oz silver (H1 2023 -\n$23.37\n),\n$945\n/oz platinum (H1 2023 -\n$1,011\n) and\n$975\n/oz palladium (H1 2023 -\n$1,508\n),\n$118\n/t Fe 62% CFR China (H1 2023 -\n$118\n),\n$78.77\n/bbl WTI oil (H1 2023 -\n$74.95\n) and\n$2.22\n/mcf Henry Hub natural gas (H1 2023 -\n$2.54\n).\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES:\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share, Adjusted Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures with no standardized meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS Accounting Standards\") and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.

        "body": "Rice University\n, MD Anderson lead research team developing affordable system for immediate digital pathology of tumors during surgery\nHOUSTON\n,\nAug. 13, 2024\n/PRNewswire/ -- A\nRice University\n-led multi-institutional research collaboration has won an award of up to\n$18 million\nover five years from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to develop and validate a new system for improving tumor removal accuracy for two types of cancer: breast, and head and neck cancer.\nContinue Reading\nRice University, Houston, TX\nCalled\u00a0AccessPath, the novel, affordable, slide-free cancer pathology system will help surgeons know whether they have completely removed tumors during surgery by enabling rapid, automatic tumor margin classification of resected tumors. AccessPath is one of several projects funded through the\nARPA-H Precision Surgical Interventions\nprogram announced today as part of a broader\n$150 million\nBiden-Harris administration Cancer Moonshot\ninitiative.\n\"Because of its low cost, high speed, and automated analysis, we believe\u00a0AccessPath can revolutionize real-time surgical guidance, greatly expanding the range of hospitals able to provide accurate intraoperative tumor margin assessment and improving outcomes for all cancer surgery patients,\" said\nRebecca Richards-Kortum\n, a Rice bioengineering professor and director of the\nRice360 Institute for Global Health Technologies\nwho is the lead PI on the project.\nAshok Veeraraghavan\n, chair of\nRice's\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering and a professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science, is a co-PI on the project.\nEvery year, nearly\n2 million Americans\nare newly diagnosed with cancer. For solid tumors, surgical removal is often the first option. Yet, during surgery, it can be difficult to tell where a tumor ends and healthy tissue begins \u00be\u00a0an area referred to as the margin \u00be\u00a0due to a lack of contrast. Due to the difficulty of identifying the margin, multiple surgeries are often required to successfully remove an entire tumor.\n\"Precise margin assessment is key to the\u00a0oncologic success of any cancer operation,\" said Dr.\nAna Paula Refinetti\n, an associate professor in the Department of Breast Surgical Oncology at The\nUniversity of Texas\nMD Anderson Cancer Center and one of the lead surgeons PIs on the project. \"The development of a new low-cost technology that enables immediate margin assessment could transform the landscape of surgical oncology \u00be\u00a0particularly in low-resource settings, reducing the number of repeat interventions, lowering cancer care costs and improving patient outcomes.\"\nAccessPath researchers are working to solve key technical challenges in tumor removal, making care for surgical pathology patients timelier and more convenient, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\nEnsuring complete tumor removal involves determining whether there is any residual cancerous tissue left at the edge of the resected area. Because it requires specialized equipment and expert personnel, the use of surgical pathology to ensure negative tumor margins is especially limited in low-resource settings in\nthe United States\nand other countries.\nThe\u00a0AccessPath system is intended to be an affordable end-to-end system for immediate digital pathology of resected tumors, with the potential to greatly expand the range of hospitals able to provide accurate intra-operative tumor margin assessment and improve outcomes for all cancer patients treated with surgery.\nThe AccessPath system includes three key technological advancements:\nA novel, rugged, high-resolution microscope design with a large field-of-view and extended depth of field that can image tumors rapidly\nThe optimization of inexpensive, fast-acting, effective fluorescent stains for dying tumor margins\nEstablishing fast and accurate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to read the imagery to classify margins as positive or negative.\nBy solving these technical challenges, AccessPath aims to significantly cut the cost of pathology equipment and streamline analysis for negative tumor margin classification in order to deliver immediate pathology assessments.\n\"These efforts build on\nRice's\nlong-standing relationship with MD Anderson Cancer Center to prevent, detect and treat cancer and ultimately save lives.\nRice\nis focused on leading innovations in health\u00a0and medicine\u00a0to address disparities,\u00a0and\u00a0I commend our researchers for their leadership on this critical project,\" said\nAmy Dittmar\n,\nRice's\nHoward R. Hughes Provost\nand executive vice president for academic affairs.\n\"AccessPath is exactly the kind of life-changing research and health care innovation we are proud to produce at\nRice\n, where we're committed to addressing and solving the world's most pressing medical issues,\" said\nRamamoorthy Ramesh\n,\nRice's\nexecutive vice president for research. \"Partnering with MD Anderson on this vital work underscores the importance of such ongoing collaborations with our neighbors in the world's largest medical center.

        "body": "HOUSTON\n,\nAug. 14, 2024\n/PRNewswire/ -- Shell Offshore Inc. (Shell), a subsidiary of Shell\u00a0plc, has taken a Final Investment Decision (FID) on a 'waterflood' project at its Vito asset in the US Gulf of Mexico. Water will be injected into the reservoir formation to displace additional oil.\nThe process is due to begin in 2027 and is expected to significantly enhance volume capacity at the Vito field.\nContinue Reading\nThis investment will deliver additional high-margin, lower-carbon barrels from our advantaged Upstream business\nPost this\nShell's Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (photo courtesy of Shell)\n\"Over time, we've seen the benefits of waterflood as we look to fill our hubs in the\nGulf of Mexico\n,\" said Zo\u00eb Yujnovich, Shell Integrated Gas and Upstream Director. \"This investment will deliver additional high-margin, lower-carbon barrels from our advantaged Upstream business while maximizing our potential from Vito.\"\nWaterflood is a method of secondary recovery where the injected water physically sweeps the displaced oil to adjacent production wells, while re-pressurizing the reservoir. The three water injection wells were all drilled as pre-producers.\nShell is the leading deep-water operator in the U.S.\nGulf of Mexico\n, where our production has among the lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity in the world for producing oil.\nNotes to editors\nIn\nJuly 2009\n, the\u00a0Vito field was discovered in more than 4,000 feet of water approximately 75 miles south of\nVenice, LA\n, 150 miles southeast of\nNew Orleans\nand 10 miles south of the Shell-operated Mars TLP.\nIn 2015, the original\u00a0Vito host design was simplified and rescoped, resulting in a reduction of approximately 80% in CO2 emissions over the lifetime of the facility as well as a cost reduction of more than 70% from the original host design concept.\nShell (Operator 63.11%) and\u00a0Equinor (36.89%) announced FID for the Vito development in\nApril 2018\n, with first oil achieved in\nFebruary 2023\n.\nGiven the properties of the\u00a0Vito reservoir, energy is required to maximize the producing rate of existing wells and thus ultimate recovery.\nThe\u00a0Vito waterflood project will increase recoverable resource volume by 60 million boe. The estimate of resources volumes is currently classified as 2P and 2C under the Society of Petroleum Engineers' Resource Classification System.\nThe reference to our\u00a0U.S.\nGulf of Mexico\nproduction having among the lowest GHG intensity in the world is a comparison among other IOGP oil-and gas-producing members.\nAs communicated at Shell's Capital Markets Day in 2023, we plan to see production\u00a0stabilise at 1.4 million barrels per day of liquids to 2030.\nCautionary Note\nThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this media release, \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ''Subsidiaries'', \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this media release refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. \"Joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\" are collectively referred to as \"joint arrangements\". Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as \"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis media release contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", ''anticipate'', ''believe'', ''could'', ''estimate'', ''expect'', ''goals'', ''intend'', ''may'', \"milestones\", ''objectives'', ''outlook'', ''plan'', ''probably'', ''project'', ''risks'', \"schedule\", ''seek'', ''should'', ''target'', ''will'' and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this media release, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this media release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022 (available at\nwww.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html\nand\nwww.sec.gov\n). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this media release and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this media release, August 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this media release.\nShell's net carbon intensity\nAlso, in this media release\u00a0we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"Net Carbon Intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\nShell's net-Zero Emissions Target\nShell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\nShell expects to publish its 2024 Energy Transition Strategy on\nMarch 14, 2024\n, which will include an update on Shell's energy transition strategy and set out Shell's climate targets and ambitions for the future.\nForward Looking Non-GAAP measures\nThis media release\u00a0may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.\nThe contents of websites referred to in this media release do not form part of this media release.\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this media release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website\nwww.sec.gov\n.\nSOURCE Shell Offshore Inc."
