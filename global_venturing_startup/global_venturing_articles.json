        "body": "A notable trend in 2024 has been a marked uptick in interest, not to mention funding, for startups focusing on women\u2019s health. Virtual menopause clinic Midi Health, period tracker developer Natural Cycles and Herself, a primary care provider for women over 65, all closed hefty series B or C rounds, while women\u2019s health app Flo Health raised funding at a billion-dollar valuation. But behind these more established companies, already at scaleup stage, there is a raft of smaller and newer startups with a range of interesting and innovative products emerging to address what\u2019s still an underserved market. Here are some worth having on your radar: Photo courtesy of Unpause Medical Ru Medical London, UK Founded: 2021 Funding to date: Undisclosed Ru Medical is the developer of Unpause, a smart wearable device that automatically provides relief from hot flushes for menopausal women. The system, designed in collaboration with King\u2019s College London and a range of general practitioners and menopause specialists, continuously monitors body temperature to identify the onset of hot flushes. It then cools the nape of the neck where the body is most receptive to cooling sensations. The company\u2019s sole venture funding so far came through a 2022 pre-seed round led by Singaporean angel investment firm Scalare Technologies that included several individual backers. Image courtesy of Eli Health Eli Montr\u00e9al, Canada Founded: 2019 Funding to date: $6.5m Hormone analysis has become more widespread as more people wake up to their importance in the difference between male and female physiology, and Eli has created a kit that can provide daily hormone data gained by testing saliva. The company was founded by CEO Marina Pavlovic Rivas and her partner, CTO Thomas Cortina, initially because Rivas couldn\u2019t find a non-invasive, hormone-free contraceptive, but the product is expected to address everything from fertility and contraception to menopause and endocrine conditions. It is also building the world\u2019s first large-scale longitudinal dataset for daily hormone levels. Eli has raised just over $5m in equity and grant funding so far, most recently securing $3.6m from investors including Canadian telecoms firm Telus\u2019s Pollinator Fund for Good in April last year. That round was expected to finance the completion of product development, clinical validation and regulatory approval. Photo courtesy of Malaica Malaica Nairobi, Kenya Founded: 2022 Funding to date: $1m+ A number of startups have sprung up in recent years with digital offerings to help guide prospective mothers through their pregnancies, but Malaica has devised a programme that combines in-person and remote care for its home market of Kenya. Malaica offers both antenatal care and postnatal care as well as personalised packages for delivery, and it has completed a pilot programme in Garissa, the town with the highest maternal mortality rate in the country. It is now talking to donors about extending that scheme to meet the needs of low-income mothers as it prepares to sign its first contract with a health insurance provider. Markus Gemuend, formerly the managing director of Roche Africa, led a $1m pre-seed round for the company last month that also featured Bay Area venture firm Kapor Capital. Photo courtesy of Leia Health Leia Stockholm, Sweden Founded: 2021 Funding to date: $2.1m Leia is also targeting childbirth, but from a completely different angle, having created an app that tracks postpartum health and helps new mothers combat depression. The app offers postpartum depression and pelvic floor tests together with feeding tracking, expert content and personalised check-ins. The service is available to individuals or as part of a corporate care offering \u2013 Leia estimates one in three employees who are new mothers change jobs because of a lack of parental support. People Ventures led Leia\u2019s $1.5m pre-seed round at the start of 2023, less than a year after the startup raised almost $600,000 to support a pilot project for its app with research organisation Karolinska Institute. Photo courtesy of Evvy Evvy New York, USA Founded: 2020 Funding to date: $19m One of the more advanced startups on this list, Evvy launched its debut product, the first at-home vaginal microbiome test to use metagenomic sequencing to screen for all bacteria and fungi from the vaginal and urinary tracts in a single swab, in 2021. Evvy has since turned its offering into an AI-powered vaginal healthcare platform that incorporates testing, precision care and coaching, adding tests for sexually transmitted infections and antibiotic resistance. The company has raised a total of $19m, $14m of which came in a series A round last September that was backed by clinical laboratory network Labcorp\u2019s Venture Fund. Image courtesy of KOKO Medical, Inc. KoKo Medical Malvern, USA Founded: 2020 Funding to date: $19m KoKo Medical is developing medical device technology intended to prevent some 150,000 women a year dying from postpartum haemorrhaging \u2013 excessively heavy bleeding after birth. The condition affects more than 10% of births according to the company, and it is caused when uterine muscles don\u2019t contract enough after birth. The startup\u2019s catheter-based system is designed to stop haemorrhaging by encouraging uterine contractions and removing excess blood. KoKo says it is still operating in \u2018deep stealth mode\u2019, and so although regulatory filings show it has raised approximately $19m in funding between 2020 and 2023, the company has not revealed any of its investors. Photo courtesy of Vyld Vyld Berlin, Germany Founded: 2021 Funding to date: Undisclosed Germany\u2019s Vyld is aiming to combine women\u2019s health with the circular economy with a biodegradable tampon made from seaweed. The Kelpon brand tampons are made from an extract derived from seaweed algae and are designed to avoid microplastics and to be used in situations where running water might not be available. The startup wants them to form part of an \u2018Algaeverse\u2019 of sustainable products, the next being a seaweed nappy. Vyld most recently raised a \u2018seven-figure amount\u2019 in seed capital from investors including the German government and the European Union\u2019s BlueInvest scheme in January this year. But much of its funding has come through Future Profit Partnership Agreements, a financing model it devised that is based on profit participation certificates rather than equity, so it won\u2019t be the quick exit favoured by many traditional VCs. Image courtesy of FemTherapeutics Inc . FemTherapeutics Montr\u00e9al, Canada Founded: 2021 Funding to date: $2.3m Roughly a third of women will experience a pelvic organ disorder in their lifetime, according to UCLA Health research, and FemTherapeutics has developed a system to help FemTherapeutics is using artificial intelligence and 3D-printed biocompatible silicone to offer personalised intra-vaginal prosthetics to treat pelvic floor disorders. The process is intended to avoid trial-and-error fittings that can be intrusive and which may still result in prosthetics that are not sized correctly. The company secured $1.85m in a May 2023 round led by 2048 Ventures that was put toward further developing its technology, initiating clinical studies, growing its team and supporting research and development. Freya Pharma Solutions Amsterdam, Netherlands Founded: 2021 Funding to date: $8.5m Viagra proved to be a revolutionary product for combatting physical sexual dysfunction in men, but only two similar options for women exist in the US market while none have received regulatory approval in Europe. Freya Pharma Solutions is working on pharmaceutical options for women with female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD). Its lead drug candidate, Lybrido, targets known neurobiological mechanisms in female bodies and has passed through phase 2 clinical trials in the US. Freya has not revealed details of its backers, but the company announced an $8.5m seed round in early 2022 it said was populated by new and existing investors. Photo of Kaitlin Christine courtesy of Gabbi Gabbi Portland, USA Founded: 2019 Funding to date: $5.4m Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death for women and screening remains one of the most potent weapons against the disease. Gabbi has built a service that uses artificial intelligence to boost results. Gabbi\u2019s at-home test uses artificial intelligence to compare individual inputs with large repositories of clinical data to create more accurate risk profiles spanning all ages and ethnicities and claims it can determine breast cancer risk with 90% accuracy. It then provides personalised treatment plans. Bread and Butter Ventures led the company\u2019s most recent funding, a $4.4m seed round in late 2022 earmarked for product development and hiring as it prepared to launch its service as an employee benefit option. Juniper London, UK Founded: 2023 Funding to date: $1.9m While healthtech is appreciated, in many countries healthcare isn\u2019t just about the procedure itself, there\u2019s also the issue of paying for treatment. That\u2019s the side of the market Juniper is targeting. Juniper offers reproductive insurance that covers a range of areas including menopause, cancer and sexual health screening, family planning and treatments for conditions such as endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, bundled as a workplace benefit. The startup\u2019s sole funding came in February this year when InsurTech Gateway led a $1.9m pre-seed round that also featured 2100 Ventures, Exceptional Ventures, Heartfelt and several angel investors."

Zero dB sources its cannabinoids from non-cannabis plants \u2014 these compounds are found in a variety of plants from raw cacao to liverworts \u2014\u00a0and so its products can be sold anywhere.

        "title": "How CVCs can support startups outside their investment thesis",
        "published": "May 16, 2024",
        "publish_date": "2024-05-16",
        "author": "Rachel Sheppard",
        "body": "As a venture director working in an industry I\u2019m passionate about there is a part of me that wishes I could invest in every novel startup that walks through our door. Having a strong investment thesis is sometimes a helpful restraint in making sure our team keeps its focus. But on the other hand, an investment thesis can sometimes feel like it\u2019s keeping you away from a company that your gut tells you is worthy of attention. Conversations in venture rooms occur daily where one of several factors doesn\u2019t lead to a unanimous yes and at least one person in the room is disappointed that they couldn\u2019t add a certain company to the portfolio. We\u2019ve been there before. At Leap Venture Studio we make 6-8 investments a year, yet we meet with over 100 companies and evaluate applications from over 200 companies globally. It can be hard to feel like your hands are tied when you want to help. If you find yourself in a similar situation, here are four ways CVCs can support startups outside of their investment thesis. Offer detailed pitch and deck feedback If a company isn\u2019t a fit for you, but you want to help them on their journey towards securing funding, one of the easiest ways to do so is by offering detailed feedback on their pitch presentation and/or their pitch deck. I find this to be most helpful for first-time founders who don\u2019t necessarily speak the \u201clanguage\u201d of venture capital. Speaking this language can make or break initial investor meetings, especially if those founders are getting used to boasting the potential of their product, or if they have to contend with unconscious bias. By offering pointers on how they could sharpen their pitches and make them more enticing for investors, you just might help them over those initial humps to score funding. You could even consider creating a portal for early-stage startups to submit their pitch decks for 5 minutes of VC feedback. Create visibility As investors we can help create visibility for startups even if we\u2019re not announcing them as a portfolio company. For example, pitch competitions are a great way to give emerging startups a literal stage. If you\u2019re already planning to attend a big industry event, consider hosting a pitch competition. They\u2019re fun, they give participants needed practice and opportunities for feedback, and more importantly, they\u2019re introduced to a broader audience. \u201cIf there\u2019s a startup that\u2019s caught your attention name drop them the next time you\u2019re giving an interview to the media.\u201d Of course, you could also create similar opportunities with far less of a time commitment. If there\u2019s a startup that\u2019s caught your attention, cheerlead them in a LinkedIn post, or better yet, name drop them the next time you\u2019re giving an interview to the media. We all know these small steps add up over time, increasing recognition and building credibility \u2013 that\u2019s why so many VC firms are hiring PR agencies these days. Open networking doors It can be really difficult to establish a network, especially if you\u2019re not based in a tech hub like San Francisco, where VCs and startups are as plentiful as specialty coffee shops. \u201cIn the CVC world we have a massive advantage when it comes to giving others a networking leg up.\u201d Sometimes the simplest and most powerful form of support you can give is introducing a founder to someone new. In the CVC world we have a massive advantage when it comes to giving others a networking leg up as our connections are typically going to include various partners, clients, and customers. Leap Venture Studio, for example, is a partnership between three different organisations who each have their own unique networks they can tap into. So if you\u2019ve got access to someone you think could be helpful for a startup, make the introduction. You can also play matchmaker by organising support groups or communities. It takes little financial investment to set up an online community like a Slack group for a specific niche you\u2019re well connected in and invite engaged community members who you know are ready and willing to help others. Finally, holding workshops or industry-specific events can help increase the visibility and credibility of your fund while also providing a networking opportunity for those in attendance. Equip them with resources they can use Earlier this year, Leap Venture Studio invited an impact company to join our pet care accelerator for the first time. It was a welcome challenge to shake up our internal status-quo and figure out exactly what support would look like for a company whose success is best measured by their impact. If you\u2019re running an accelerator, incubator, or startup hub of your own, I recommend you try something similar. In the past, we\u2019ve invited startup founders along for tours of production facilities. Granting them access to a \u201cpeek behind the curtain\u201d is a great advantage that many traditional VCs may not necessarily have. This could also look like opening doors to industry experts who are supporting our program. Alternatively, you could follow the lead of some traditional VC firms who have created resources for their portfolio companies and then opened up those resources to others. For example, TheVentureCity launched Growth Scanner, an online data analysis tool available to any startup. Similarly, Growth Warrior Capital made an AI pitch deck generator for founders. It can be invaluable for startups to receive a free tech boost in finding product-market fit or appealing to investors. Working in CVC is a privilege that affords us a lot of power and influence over how our industries evolve and grow. So if there is a startup out there that you want to help succeed, but can\u2019t invest in, remember that support can look like much more than a number on a cheque.

        "body": "Every CVC agrees that the most exciting thing about the job is the new technologies they come across. Investing in up and coming companies, technologies, founders and entrepreneurs is how CVCs make a difference \u2013 to their parent company, to the bottom line, and, of course, to the world at large. The 2024 GCV Symposium in London is once again bringing an exciting cohort of startups to showcase, speak and present to the community of corporate venturers and innovators. If you\u2019re attending the Symposium today or tomorrow, you will be able to meet and find out more about these companies. And if you\u2019re missing out, here is a complete guide to all the startups. Spacetech A number of spacetech startups have sprung up in the UK and wider Europe over the past few years, as the SpaceX effect has seen costs fall and demonstrated how privately held companies can speed up space development. And it\u2019s not just rockets, space technology is impacting everything from robotics to solar energy. On day one of the Symposium, 25 June, space sustainability is on the agenda with UK-based Space Villages exhibiting its technology. The company is developing robots that can repair satellites in space. Sustainable space outfit Stars Edge will also be showcasing its electrical thruster technology. On day two, London-based Space Power , which is developing supplementary power sources for satellites, will be exhibiting, as well as Astron Systems , which develops reusable rockets. Read more: Read our full round-up of the spacetech coming to the GCV Symposium Sustainability Sustainability is a staple ingredient in the startup world, and it\u2019s something corporates are keen to invest in, with many net zero targets fast approaching. With so many aspects to industry and consumption, the world of sustainability tech is wide and far reaching, and the startups showcasing at the GCV Symposium reflect that scope. Tackling the ever present issue of packaging, Kelpi , exhibiting at the GCV Symposium on day one, has created a real alternative to fossil-fuel plastics \u2013 a bioplastic coating that is made using seaweed. FlexSea is another startup that uses seaweed to create a bioplastic packaging solution that degrades within a matter of weeks. Catch FlexSea on the main stage at 9.40am on day two when the CEO will be talking about leveraging the power of strategic investors. The CEO from Uncaged Innovations , a company creating a sustainable and cruelty free replacement for animal leather, is speaking on the main stage at 14.50 on day one, as part of a panel discussion about CVC impact on early-stage companies. Waste and recycling is also represented among the startups showcasing on day one, with FibeRight , a company solving the problem of unrecyclable waste, and Oxi-tech Solutions , which has developed a method of water sanitation that avoids the use of harsh chemicals.

Read more: Is Tokamak Energy\u2019s spherical design the key to affordable fusion? We have two quantum/fusion startups speaking as part of the deep tech portfolio showcase at 10.35 on day two of the conference. Oxford Ionics is launching a new age of computing by developing processors that use a patented system to immeasurably improve the scalability and reliability of quantum computing. First Light Fusion has a new approach to inertial fusion that is simpler, more energy efficient and has a lower physics risk. Its method will allow fusion technology to scale. Healthcare The developments happening in healthcare technology are always exciting to see, and we have three healthtechs appearing at the Symposium. Exhibiting on day one is POM Health , which has created a medical grade hormone monitor that can make precise and personalised healthcare recommendations. It\u2019s almost like a constant glucose monitor for type 1 diabetics but for everyone. Imagine how this could transform everyday health for the masses. Appearing on the main stage on day two is Feel , a nutritional supplement made with no additives. The CEO of Feel will be talking about how to harness the power of strategic investors. With a wide range of use cases (one of which being the field of healthcare), Oxfordshire based Living Optics is an imaging technology that can produce images beyond what the human eye can see. As well as in healthcare, its hyperspectral imaging has use cases in agriculture, remote sensing and more. See the CEO of Living Optics speak on the main stage at 10.35 on day two as part of the deep tech showcase. And the rest The breadth and scope of technology showcasing and featuring at this year\u2019s Symposium is as wide ranging as you might expect, so there are some that don\u2019t fit neatly into the above categories. If mobility tech is your thing, don\u2019t miss the mobility roundtable in Thames 2 at 15.40 on day one. Contributing to the discussion will be Lambda4 , a German company that has developed algorithms that use bluetooth to assess distance measurements. Applications include smartlocks, smart lights and autotech. Also featured in the mobility roundtable will be Transport Design International (TDI) , a UK-based company that makes lightweight vehicles with zero emissions batteries. On the main stage on day one at 14.50, the CEOs from Verax AI and ChipFlow will speak about the impact CVCs can have on early stage companies. Verax AI provides a trust solution software that enables enterprises to use generative AI while maintaining correctness and compliance. ChipFlow manufactures custom-made integrated circuits that enables product companies to create their own chips. Completing the list of startups exhibiting on day one is TherMap Solutions , which uses a proprietary data acquisition system (thermoreflectance) to analyse heat management for semiconductors materials and their packaging, and AI Dizital , an affordable blockchain solution that can be used for enterprise. And finally, exhibiting on day two is cybersecurity software developer Securium , which is focused on safeguarding vulnerable individuals online (in particular, children), and Weeteq , a tiny technology developer that uses artificial intelligence on a circuit level."

        "body": "Photo courtesy of FreePik Investing in fine wines and spirits has been a popular alternative investment for some time, alongside other luxury investments such as cars, luxury clothes and art. But the alcohol investment market can be tricky to navigate and rife with scams. The City of London Police reported that in 2023, 89 reports were made to Action Fraud about alcohol investment scams with losses totaling more than $3.8m. Cask fraud in the whisky market is enough of a growing problem that it was raised in the Scottish parliament earlier this year. Could a blockchain-based trading platform be one way around this? Baxus, a US-based startup, has created a trading platform that offers people access to luxury spirits and alcohol with the aim of eliminating the fear of buying a counterfeit product. Photo of Baxus team. (Left to right) Tzvi Wiesel is CEO and co-founder, Carrie Kellar is CTO and co-founder, and Finian Sedgwick is COO. The company uses a blockchain-based protocol for storing, authenticating, and tokenising luxury spirits and wines. Finian Sedgwick, Baxus chief operating officer, says that the company incorporates blockchain technology, AI learning and data analysts to provide users with up-to-date pricing analysis. \u201cBuilt on Solana, the Baxus Marketplace harnesses open Web3 payment infrastructure to reduce costs, increase transparency, and infuse liquidity into what has historically been a fragmented, offline market,\u201d says Sedgewick. Baxus allows users to make transactions through credit cards, direct wire and cryptocurrency. The bottles are authenticated with an radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag and given a unique non-fungible token. The token is entered into the seller\u2019s digital portfolio, which includes the bottle\u2019s pricing data history. The owner can decide when to list a bottle on the platform\u2019s market. Photo courtesy of FreePik Baxus stores all its bottles in a climate-controlled environment to ensure uniformity in its products and protect consumers from scams. In addition, the operators claim buyers are free from hidden fees when purchasing spirits. Tzvi Wiesel, chief executive, cofounded Baxus in 2021. An experienced whiskey trader and collector, he was head of old and rare bottles at Dalkeith Brokerage, a malt scotch bottling company. Sedgwick says that Baxus addresses the issue of investment scams and other global issues of supply chain transparency, sustainability, and efficient trading platforms. \u201cBy providing a transparent and traceable ecosystem including vaulting for collectible spirits, we contribute to reducing waste, combating counterfeit products, and promoting fair trade practices,\u201d he says. \u201cOur platform aligns with broader efforts to digitise and optimise supply chains, which are increasingly important in a rapidly changing global market,\u201d says Sedgwick. Baxus isn\u2019t the only online wine and spirit marketplace to tap into blockchain. Panama-based BlockBar has a similar idea and reported sales of $7m in 2022. Growing investment interest Photo courtesy of Pexels Baxus has raised $5m in a seed funding round this year led by Multicoin Capital. Other investors include Solana Ventures, the corporate venture arm of blockchain platform Solana, as well as\u00a0FJ Labs and Narwhal Ventures. Having corporate backers has been vital in growing the startup, says Sedgwick. \u201cWorking with big our investors has provided us with invaluable strategic guidance, industry insights, and access to resources that have accelerated our growth trajectory.\u201d \u201cThey have offered incredible support in areas such as product development, market expansion, strategy, and networking, enhancing our credibility and opening doors to new opportunities for collaboration and innovation,\u201d he says. The new funding will be used to further build the platform. \u201cThis capital will be used to expand globally, scale our pioneering technologies, and continue to innovate to meet the evolving needs of the collectible spirits market,\u201d he says."

        "body": "Photo courtesy of Pexels The search is still on for generative AI systems that are robust and specific enough for use by corporate customers, such as big banks. Boston-based Linq, which raised $6.6m in June from investors including Korea\u2019s Kakao Ventures, believes it may have the answer. The company is developing a vector database management platform that empowers companies to use large language models to unlock the full potential of their internal information. \u201cSearching on company data is a huge challenge. And we provide one of the most accurate search engines for them using the technology called vector search,\u201d says Jacob Choi, co-founder and chief executive. \u201cLinq\u2019s vector search platform uses a company\u2019s internal knowledge, which was previously under-utilised due to the lack of search accuracy, to provide accurate and efficient retrieval of information,\u201d says Choi. \u201cThe platform seamlessly integrates with various information sources such as Notion, Slack, and email, and maintains a real-time sync vector database, similar to Dropbox for vector search.\u201d Jacob Choi, chief executive and co-founder of Linq Choi says that what makes Linq\u2019s technology stand out from its competitors is its ability to tackle the \u2018hallucinations\u2019 problem with large language models. \u201cLinq\u2019s service is uniquely capable of comprehensively understanding and searching through multimodal data. The platform also offers seamless integration with various information sources and maintains a real-time sync vector database, enhancing the accuracy of retrieval and user experience,\u201d says Choi. \u201cOther companies can only decode text,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can decode different data such as images and tables. We have our in-house embedding model which is one of the most significant components in making this vector search accurate so our embedding model has surpassed the accuracy of OpenAI.\u201d Jin Kim, the head of product and data science at Linq says that while the easy accessibility of OpenAI\u2019s API has spawned many generative AI businesses, there are still very few that meet the domain-specific search accuracy that enterprises expect. Making the unit economics work when creating domain-specific AI is difficult, says Kim. \u201cIn many cases, these two aspects are inversely proportional but ultimately both aspects must be met to set the foundations of a viable product. Linq had the privilege to learn this early on from multiple iterations with customers and now onto the next step to enhance both aspects even more,\u201d he says. Choi and Kim founded Linq in 2022 alongside several other MIT scholars such as Chanyeol Choi and  Subeen Pang. Jacob Choi previously was a graduate research assistant at MIT for three years and also spent a year as a hardware engineer at Qualcomm, a US-based semiconductor corporation. Using corporate partnerships to grow Linq\u2019s platform courtesy of Linq Linq has built up customers in the financial services sector , including Samsung Financial Networks, KPMG US and hedge funds in both the US and Asia. The startup is also looking at other fields such as  insurance \u2014\u00a0collaborating with Samsung Fire & Marine insurance \u2014\u00a0 and law firms such as Law & Good. \u201cProfessional fields like legal sectors is what we are focused on. We have also built and maintained strong relationships with South Korean and US corporations which is helping our company evolve at the correct speed,\u201d he says. Digital healthcare company Doctornow and learning application platform Enuma have implemented Linq\u2019s vector search platform. Corporate collaboration was kickstarted when Linq won the 2023 Samsung Open Collaboration competition, one of the most prestigious startup competitions in South Korea. \u201cWorking with big corporations like Samsung has provided us with valuable insights and strategic help. We have had the opportunity to connect with the right departments within these corporations, which has significantly contributed to our growth and development,\u201d says Choi Choi says that the partnerships with big companies were extremely helpful when it came to raising its recent $6.6m round led by InterVest and Atinum, with participation from TechStars, Kakao Ventures, Smilegate Investment and Yellowdog. \u201cThe fundraising process was challenging in general but it was clear to us that investors were keen on what Linq had to offer,\u201d he says. Linq team at the Samsung Open Collaboration Awards Nevertheless Choi says it is tough to be a small startup in the generative AI market. \u201cIt is the most competitive field I have seen in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the big IT corporations such as AWS are evolving very quickly and are injecting a lot of capital in this sector. To ensure that we don\u2019t fall through the cracks, as a team we set up new strategies and implement it soon as possible and iterate this with our clients every week. So far this has been successful but you have to make traction as soon as possible and move onto the next stage.\u201d The funding will be used for product development and hiring more staff. Linq currently has just 12 employees. ."

        "body": "If you\u2019re on the move and reading this, chances are your fingers are in contact with a conductive glass screen coated with ITO (indium tin oxide), a chemical that allows your mobile phone screen to react to your touch. Glass itself isn\u2019t conductive. When your finger touches the ITO-treated screen, the electrical field changes, telling the phone\u2019s chip where your finger is. The conductive layer senses your touch, allowing the smartphone to identify which app or function you\u2019re activating. Electrical conductivity is what makes all of our technology work\u2014it\u2019s straightforward with metal-based materials. However, making transparent materials like glass or plastic conduct electricity is remarkably challenging Currently, market options for touchscreen tech include ITO, nano-silver, and metal mesh. These manufacturing techniques are either complex (multiple layers), have visible nano-wires, are toxic, or are very expensive to produce. The transparency index ranges from 88% to 91%, with ITO at the lowest of the range. Your iPhone\u2019s glass transparency index is 88%. For starters, ITO is a toxic chemical. Studies with animals indicate that indium tin oxide is toxic when ingested, with negative effects on the kidney, lungs, and heart. A new occupational hazard called \u2018indium lung disease\u2019 has been identified. The first patient, a worker involved in the wet surface grinding of ITO, suffered from interstitial pneumonia with lungs filled with ITO particles. A startup in China has developed a non-toxic alternative for transparent touchscreens: a nano-thin layer of silver between two nano-thin layers of substrates (such as plastic). It\u2019s non-toxic, features low surface resistance that is more than ten times lower than ITO, ultra-high light transmittance, low haze, high flexibility, and a wide range of application possibilities. The transparency index is an impressive 91% because the silver is only a few nanometers thick. In fact, it\u2019s so transparent it\u2019s very hard to see the material. Beyond touchscreens, different formulations of the highly transparent nanofilm made via physical vapour deposition (PVD) of metal can increase solar panel efficiency, enhance display performance, and improve energy efficiency of buildings and cars by blocking infrared light. Incubated at University of Michigan and Beijing Institute of Collaborative Innovation (BICI), this material breakthrough was further developed by a renowned nanotechnologist, Professor Lingjie Guo at University of Michigan, with a research grant from BICI. Prof Guo developed a multi-element alloy formula for co-sputtering targets and a sputtering process \u2014 a method for depositing thin films on substrates \u2014 that avoids island structures common in the PVD silver deposition process. The result is a film that is clear, consistent, and smooth. Prof Guo has published this research in top international journals, such as Science Advance, Nature Communications, Adv Mater and more. Zenithnano, the Beijing-based nano-conductive materials company, licensed the technology from University of Michigan. When CM Venture Capital\u2019s founders Dr Patrick Berbon and Dr Min Zhou saw a sample from a mid-scale trial in 2019 they were impressed. CM Venture placed a Rmb30m (~ $5m) seed investment in the startup as a sole investor to further the tech. They had seen dozens of startups in the ITO-replacement field before and recognised immediately how unique and elegant Zenithnano\u2019s material solution was. That sole seed investment from CM Venture kicked off a commercialisation journey. Professor Guo holding an A4-size sample sheet cut from a 100m-long roll produced at Fraunhofer (it\u2019s highly transparent; you have to look really hard to see). Today, the material is produced at Zenithnano\u2019s 19,700 m2 plant in Guangzhou, China. Made on the world\u2019s most advanced roll-to-roll magnetron sputtering production line, the transparent, flexible, conductive nanomaterial has a wide range of uses. The roll-to-roll production process for Zenithnano\u2019s conductive films is simpler than nano-silver and metal mesh formats, keeping costs low and affordability high. What these breakthrough nanofilms can do for technology and the environment 1) Provide flexible and transparent electrodes for touchscreens and colour-changing windows As a transparent conductive electrode, Zenithnano\u2019s clear nanofilms have a thickness of 7 nanometers \u2013 compare that to a typical iPhone\u2019s ITO-treated glass screen, where the ITO thickness is over 100nm. The material is flexible, bendable, not fragile like ITO, and perfect for a new generation of folding screens or large touchscreen TVs. It can be used in touch displays, electrochromic (tint/color-changing) windows, perovskite solar panels and more. Zenithnano\u2019s electrode film can replace ITO-touchscreens for a thinner and more flexible product form, with better product performance from electrical conductivity that\u2019s 10X better. The transparent electrodes can be used for colour-changing electrochromic windows on buildings and vehicles, helping to reduce our reliance on air conditioning and carbon footprint on a large scale. 2) Eliminate solar panel failure by keeping oxygen and moisture out Since Zenithnano\u2019s \u2018nanofilm sandwich\u2019 usually features unique metal alloys in between other thin films (such as dielectric material), adjusting the layers makes the perfect oxygen/water vapour barrier for quantum dots (QD), N-type and perovskite solar panels, which are constantly exposed to sun and rain. This is crucial, as perovskite, a key material that converts light to energy, becomes unstable in the presence of moisture, potentially leading to solar panel failure. Because of its high transparency levels and ability to keep moisture out, the nano-material is extremely effective for QD films, keeping QLED TV screens clear, sharp and bright for years. 3) Improve solar panel performance by reflecting light and heat Solar energy requires constant light input to be effective, and as the earth rotates, the direction of the sunlight changes. When Zenithnano\u2019s nanofilms are modified and used on the front of solar panels, the films do two things: they can filter out UV light for improved solar cell lifetime, and when they are used on the back panel they can reflect light back to the panels. Mirrors or polished metal are not typically used in these areas as they\u2019re either fragile, heavy or too expensive. As a light reflector, the specially-tuned nanofilms can also be used as a reflective surface for laser projection TVs \u2013 essentially short-throw projectors \u2013 to reject ambient light, while keeping visuals crisp and clear. Not only can it be designed to block out UV but also IR, so the nanofilms make excellent window films for buildings and vehicles: the material can reflect 90% of infrared heat, without blocking visible light, reducing the reliance on energy-consuming HVAC systems. A laser TV example (88\u201d laser TV from Hisense) With several product lines introduced in the market, Zenithnano is approaching close to $20m in revenue this year and growing fast. Next time you tap your mobile phone screen or think about the efficiency of your solar-energy system, consider the green innovation coming out of China.

        "body": "Photo courtesy of FreePik It was his own past struggles with alcohol that motivated Michael Russell to set up Monument, a healthcare startup focused on helping people stop drinking. \u201cI have some challenges with alcohol issues in the prior years of my life and it was a struggle for me,\u201d says Russell. \u201cOver the years of trying to figure out my addiction struggles I found out there was a simple medication that can act as a deterrent for me with drinking, which I did not even know I could use.\u201d Russell felt there was a need for a simple, quick way to get help and information to those struggling with alcohol addiction. He is a serial founder, having launched startups such as ZipDrug, a US-based customer-to-pharmacy connecting platform, as well as five other tech startups including premium athletic socks developer Bombas which was featured on the angel investment show Shark Tank. It was natural to turn his startup-building skill into addressing a gap in addiction care. \u201cThe thinking was that we could deliver access, information and connect physicians or therapists with a person struggling with addiction in five to 10 minutes \u2013 which has the potential to change their lives,\u201d he says. Gap in the market Addiction is a problematic area of the healthcare sector. The Covid-19 pandemic has seen an increase in people across the world struggling with substance abuse, particularly with alcohol. A large portion of them are not currently getting adequate treatment. Addiction Center, a US-based addiction support platform has reported that around 20% of American adults (about 28 million) have an alcohol use disorder; with only about 7% of those people ever getting treatment. This statistic varies depending on countries that have a serious alcohol epidemic such as Hungary, Russia and South Korea. Photo courtesy of Pexels Funding is always in short supply, with Rehab UK, for example, reporting that addiction treatment funding in the UK dropped from $20.8m in 2015 to $11.1m in 2020. Russell believes Monument can use technology to help fill a gap in the market. The online platform partners with employers to offer virtual alcohol treatment ranging from physician care to community-based peer support. The care plan includes a variety of tools including cognitive behavioural therapy. The Monument healthcare plans are personalised to members\u2019 goals and lifestyles. Most forms of addiction are treated through therapy, detox and medication management. Monument doesn\u2019t prescribe drugs \u2014\u00a0this is left to other healthcare professionals. \u201cWe don\u2019t involve ourselves in prescribing controlled substances and if there is a higher patient risk, our doctors and therapists could refer those individuals to the correct care services,\u201d says Russell. Photo of Michael Russell, founder and CEO of Monument But hybrid care, with rapid online access to healthcare professionals can play a key role in treating addiction says Russell.  \u201cSeeing a doctor and a therapist through an online medium and getting advice straight away was, for me at least, game-changing,\u201d he says. Russell is interested in what AI tools might be able to add to the platform, but at the same time, he\u2019s cautious about over-reliance on technologies and virtual care. \u201cMost addiction treatments do require some offline support. If you push everything online, in certain areas, it doesn\u2019t work and could backfire on the patient,\u201d he says. \u201cThe innovation comes from the ability to do certain care and oversight through virtual but doing it responsibly.\u201d One of Monument\u2019s unique points is that appointments with its therapists and physicians are covered by major insurance plans. \u201cThe biggest issue we see in healthcare is price transparency, access and being able to tell somebody how much it costs prior without worrying about additional bills,\u201d says Russell. Photo courtesy of Pexels \u201cWe focus a lot on obtaining insurance coverage for patients. We are signed with the major insurance companies where people can submit their insurance and we have built technology that allows somebody to know what they\u2019ll need to pay before the appointment,\u201d says Russell. A similar hybrid care system could work for treating other types of addiction says Russell.  \u201cI think most addiction areas require hybrid care. I have only really worked in the alcohol space but I believe that in some of the other substance use spaces I think you can also deliver effective healthcare through an online medium too,\u201d says Russell. Startups tackling other types of addiction include US-based telehealth opioid and addiction care startup Boulder Care, which raised $35m in a series C round this year. The round saw participation from Laerdal Million Lives Fund, the corporate venture fund of healthcare products provider Laerdal. What is getting investors hooked Russell says that investors are growing increasingly aware of virtual care since the pandemic. \u201cThere were a whole lot of healthcare investors between 2020 and 2021. At this point, the whole community has gotten intelligent about virtual care so there is still funding but you have to be on point and have a business model that makes sense to secure funding,\u201d he says. Photo courtesy of FreePik He also believes that investors are willing to invest in alcohol addiction treatment startups because of the rising epidemic caused by alcoholism. \u201cAlcohol is a major problem. It has been for a long time so our technology has the chance to reach millions of people who struggle with this issue making it an attractive investment opportunity,\u201d says Russell. \u201cInvestors make game-changing contributions,\u201d says Russell. \u201cI think if it is a healthcare startup, investors are more emotionally drawn to it. They dedicate more time to the company and we have seen a deeper level of support from these investors too.\u201d Since its launch, Russell says that Monument has raised around $20m-$30m in total funding. In 2021, the company raised $10.3m in a series A round led by VMG Catalyst. Other investors include venture capital firms Rosecliff Venture Partners, Calm Ventures and Interplay (New York). The funding is being used to develop Monument\u2019s products and scale up the company. \u201cThe money will be used to push out our billing product which allows somebody to enter their insurance instantly,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will also be expanding across multiple care verticals both in mental and medical health.\u201d Challenges Photo courtesy of Pexels Healthcare startups can be challenging to manage, at least because of complex and changeable regulations. \u201cThe virtual market evolves very quickly. There is an element of changing regulatory compliance rules we must juggle while working out the safest way to deliver virtual care in the addiction space,\u201d says Russell. Privacy policies can be another stumbling block, as Monument found out the hard way earlier this year when the company was fined $2.5m by the US Federal Trade Commission for sharing patient health information with third parties . Despite this setback, Russell is determined to keep going, not least because there are still so few alternatives for people with alcohol addiction. \u201cThe statistics published on addiction issues are pretty horrifying. So I truly believe virtual care can be a powerful tool and experience for those struggling to get access to the support they need,\u201d says Russell."

        "body": "Photo courtesy of alperkures via Pixabay Earth\u2019s underground regions remain relatively unexplored, but are becoming increasingly important commercially, with geothermal energy, for example, a potentially bountiful source of renewable power that is still mostly untapped . Mining technology is also becoming more prominent as rare earth minerals make up a crucial part of more and more electronic products, and underground space could prove a more efficient way of building out infrastructure. Technological development is making it increasingly possible to tap into previously unreachable subterranean regions. Here are some of the most exciting startups to emerge recently in this area, from the creator of the first ever geothermal energy panel and the developer of a system that uses electricity to break down rocks to a company that wants to build city-wide underground delivery networks. Photo courtesy of Sage Geosystems Sage Geosystems Houston, USA Founded: 2020 Funding to date: $41m+ Although several countries, most notably Indonesia, Iceland and Kenya, source a significant amount of their power from geothermal energy, those countries tend to be the ones situated in volcanic regions where heat and water are both close to the earth\u2019s surface. Sage Geosystems believes that represents only 2% of the overall geothermal energy resource. The company has adapted oil and gas exploration technology to create artificial reservoirs underground,  using pressurised water to create the steam necessary for energy. The company has also netted a Pentagon contract to develop an underground energy storage system for renewable power. Geothermal project developer Ignis H2 Energy and sister company Geolog International supplied an undisclosed amount of investmentfor Sage in late 2022 before Chesapeake Energy Corporation led a $17m series A round disclosed in February this year. That was increased to $41m shortly afterwards according to a regulatory filing. Photo c ourtesy of Enerdrape Enerdrape Ecublens, Switzerland Founded: 2019 Funding to date: $2.7m Enerdrape, a spinout from the Swiss Institute of Technology of Lausanne, is also working on technology that would expand the sources of geothermal energy. It has created what it claims is the world\u2019s first geothermal panel technology, which is being piloted in a project shortly set to be deployed in the town of Aigle. The system is modular and prefabricated and is designed to be installed in existing subsurface infrastructure like tunnels or parking garages. In theory, they could capture shallow geothermal energy that is then used to heat or cool the buildings above, without the need for drilling or boring. Most of Enerdrape\u2019s earlier financing came from grants, in addition to a $170,000 convertible note from Venture Kick. Its first full funding round was closed in January this year, as Swiss energy utility Romande Energie joined investment firm Apr\u00e8s-demain to provide $1.5m in seed capital for the startup. Eden co-founders Ammar Alali and Paris Smalls. Photo courtesy of Eden Eden Somerville, USA Founded: 2017 Funding to date: $22.7m Eden is developing technology it calls Electrical Reservoir Stimulation, which uses electricity to break underground rocks. The company says the technique has the potential to cut water consumption and carbon emissions from drilling, while simultaneously reducing the earthquake risks from fracking. The system could be used to secure geothermal and hydrogen energy as well as for rock-based carbon storage and mining. Eden claims its technology can halve the energy needed for breaking up rocks by creating micro fractures before they are dug up, meaning they can be broken down more easily. Petroleum drilling contractor Helmerich & Payne and TechEnergy Ventures, the investment arm of oil and gas producer Tecpetrol, co-led Eden\u2019s $12m seed round last October with help from mining group Anglo American. The rest of its funding had come from grants, most notably from the National Science Foundation. Another US government institution, the Department of Energy, has put up $1.4m for a pilot geologic hydrogen project in the Middle Eastern country of Oman. Rigid Robotics Vancouver, Canada Founded: 2013 Funding to date: N/A Rigid Robotics may have been around for over a decade but it\u2019s a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in the mining industry, having developed an industrial internet-of-things system that combines AI with advanced data analytics from sensors in mining equipment. The company\u2019s platform can host several mining software applications and is intended to be the bridge between them, meaning it could automate the loading process in mines. But in a more immediate sense, it can track the performance of vehicle operators and maintenance for machinery as well as analysing conditions for drilling or blast engineers before they go to work on an area. Rigid has not revealed any funding details thus far, but University of British Columbia\u2019s entrepreneurship@UBC venture incubator counts it as a portfolio company. It appointed seasoned mining executive Ryan Hawes as CEO last month, with founding chief executive Mehran Motamed moving to a joint president and chief technology officer role. See our full list of recent university spinouts here. Photo courtesy of RockMass Technologies RockMass Technologies Toronto, Canada Founded: 2016 Funding to date: $2.8m+ RockMass has also developed mining analytics technology based on research at Queen\u2019s University, in Ontario, Canada. It provides detailed ongoing geological data to help industrial and mining customers optimise digging models and increase efficiency. The tech allows users to access geological mapping through a handheld lidar device called the RockMass Eon (left), a system the startup says is up to nine times faster than manual mapping techniques. It has been utilised by geotechnical software producer Rocscience and engineering consulting firm Golder. SOSV and BDC Capital were joined by angel investors from Maple Leaf Angels and the Creative Destruction Lab in the company\u2019s $2m seed round in 2020. Its co-founders, Shelby Yee and Matthew Gubasta, have both been part of Forbes\u2019 30 Under 30 for manufacturing and industry list. Photo courtesy of hyperTunnel Limited HyperTunnel Basingstoke, UK Founded: 2018 Funding to date: N/A HyperTunnel is looking to bring together a range of technologies from mining, surveying, boring and 3D printing in an innovative tunnelling system it believes could be both faster and cheaper than existing methods, which date back to the 19 th century. The company combines AI and swarm robotics, which are fed through a grid of pipes to carve chambers in the ground and install access points while supplying survey data that can be used to form a digital twin of the planned tunnel. Essentially, it builds a 3D-printed structure in the ground that forms the basis of the structure. HyperTunnel\u2019s strategic partners include Network Rail, which operates the UK\u2019s rail infrastructure, and it has received grant funding from the UK government to build an underpass at the Global Centre of Rail Excellence in Wales this year. TerraStor Fort Worth, USA Founded: 2021 Funding to date: N/A TerraStor is working on grid-scale energy storage infrastructure that would house energy in underground caverns like the ones created by salt domes, a process where salt or other minerals move into underlying rock. The advanced compressed air energy storage plants would use a large electric compressor to push highly pressurised air into a storage cavern until it is needed (diagram left). The caverns are expected to be able to store energy from eight hours to a full day and would offer over 100 MW in output. The company has yet to announce a full-scale funding round but it passed through the Startupbootcamp Australia accelerator in 2022. It was incubated by Harvard University\u2019s Harvard Innovation Labs. Delta g Birmingham, UK Founded: 2023 Funding to date: $2.6m Spun out of University of Birmingham last year, Delta g is looking to build what it describes as \u2018Google Maps for the underground space,\u2019 made possible by its portable gravity gradient sensors, which have been designed to accurately detect buried features. Delta g\u2019s sensors use quantum technology to detect underground features by their gravitational profile. They are intended to map complex underground locations quickly and accurately without requiring excavation and are unaffected by vibrational noise, hypothetically reducing the disruption caused by road repairs. The startup emerged with $2m from a pre-seed round led by Science Creates Ventures and backed by Quantum Exponential Group, Newable Ventures, Bristol Private Equity Club and various angel investors, with the UK government\u2019s Innovate UK agency adding a $600,000 grant. Photo courtesy of Pipedream Labs, Inc. Pipedream Labs Austin, USA Founded: 2020 Funding to date: $15m Pipedream Labs developing an underground network for deliveries, a model it calls hyperlogistics. The network would consist of subterranean tunnels three to six feet under cities, linked by automated pick-up points, where an electrically powered vehicle can send goods back and forth. It could hypothetically be used to for food and last-mile ecommerce delivery and a pilot project is currently underway in the suburbs of Atlanta. Pipedream graduated from Techstars in 2021 and closed $1.6m in seed funding the following year. Starship Ventures then led a $13m series A round in April 2024 that also featured Cortado Ventures and Myelin Ventures. It plans to choose a city for the first iteration of its large-scale delivery network later this year.

        "body": "Heavy industry is responsible for 22% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and is considered one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise. Clean energy solutions such as battery storage, renewable energy and hydrogen are often not viable or even available at the scale heavy industry operators need. Mitigation technologies such as carbon capture are still very expensive to run. But a number of startups are working on technologies that may help. These companies are not often in the limelight \u2014 they tend to be the kind of B2B businesses that don\u2019t feature often in the media. But many of them are already working with industry partners to test and validate their solutions. The Energy Council at Global Corporate Venturing presented a showcase of some of the startups that their members are working with. Many of these young companies seek new partners to run pilot programmes with and they are raising funding rounds to scale up and commercialise their businesses. Here are the startups to watch from that showcase: AIS Field This Turkish startup has developed a robotic system to carry out the dangerous work of inspecting oil storage tanks. Tanks often have to be drained for maintenance work, an exercise that can cost energy companies some $2.5m in downtime. The RUVI Oildiver robot, however, is designed to be submerged in oil and can carry out maintenance while the tank is full. With more than 100,000 storage tanks worldwide, the potential market for this is large. AIS Field has been working with Tupras, the Turkish oil company, to test the patent-pending technology and is seeking other strategic partners and investors. The team would like to raise $1.5m to expand its commercial team and accelerate international expansion. AIS Field team, image courtesy of AIS Field Ardent Capturing carbon at industrial facilities is the most effective way to decarbonise heavy industry but doing this efficiently is still a challenge. US-based startup Ardent has developed a membrane technology that can separate pollutants from the air at lower concentrations and in hotter and wetter conditions than has been possible before. The company believes this can help bring down the cost of point-source carbon capture. The team has pilot projects with companies in the steelmaking, kilning and petrochemical industries. It says it can bring out the product commercially by 2026. It is raising a series B funding round and wants to undertake more pilot projects with industry partners. Image courtesy of Ardent. Einsted Transitioning to using hydrogen as a fuel source is a key part of the decarbonisation agenda but producing hydrogen is still expensive. Argentina-based Einsted has developed a technique to convert methane into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes using ultra-fast plasma pulses. Einstein says that this method is between three and ten times faster than existing hydrogen electrolysers, and creates 30% more energy. Because it operates at room temperature, rather than requiring high heat, this makes it energy efficient. The company, which has a team of 18 people, has a pilot with Vista, the Argentinian energy company, which is also an investor in the company. The team is seeking to raise a $1.2m funding round to take the technology forward. The metatron plasma pyrolysis reactor. Image courtesy of Einsted. Electrified Thermal Solutions One of the reasons that heavy industry struggles to switch to a zero carbon energy sources is because it needs very high temperature heat for its processes, which is difficult to produce with alternative energy. Electrified Thermal Solutions, an MIT spinout, has developed a system based on electrically conductive firebricks which can take renewable energy \u2014 from solar, wind or elsewhere \u2014 and deliver it to industrial users as a hot gas with a temperature of around 1,800 degrees celsius. The company claims the system is three times cheaper than any green hydrogen approach. Electric Thermal is running an elevator-sized demonstration unit but is looking to raise money to scale up these units to be able to handle thousands of megawatts of energy. The team is about halfway to raising a $20m funding round for this scaling up project. Image courtesy of Electrified Thermal Solutions. Mirico Measuring emissions such as methane is another headache for heavy industry. It is hard to cut emissions if you can\u2019t tell exactly where they are coming from and how much is escaping. Mirico, a UK startup, is hoping to address this problem with a laser spectroscopy system that can monitor an entire industrial site\u2019s emissions with a high degree of precision, even in poor weather. The company has validated its technology with Shell, the Anglo-Dutch energy company, and recently raised a $2m seed round. It is seeking to raise a $5m series A round to improve the products and increase customer uptake. Image courtesy of Mirico. Thea Energy Nuclear fusion is another of the great hopes for unlimited clean energy. Stellerators are seen as one of the leading ways to achieve these controlled reactions. But these complex rings of magnets are notoriously difficult to manufacture. Thea Energy has developed a new type of stellerator architecture, consisting of arrays of flat magnets that can be dynamically positioned to create exactly the shape needed. The team says this means it can advance more rapidly than other fusion companies and at lower cost. The startup, which was spun out of Princeton University and Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, is seeking to raise a series B funding round to help it build an integrated stellerator system by the end of the decade. Render of Thea Energy\u2019s stellarator design. Image courtesy of Thea Energy. Wase This UK startup has developed a way to speed up the process of turning food industry waste into biogas for energy. At the moment this is mainly done through anaerobic digestion, a process that is still relatively inefficient, time-consuming and requires bulky storage tanks. Wase\u2019s solution is an electro-methanogenic reactor in which electrodes containing membranes of electrically active bacteria create a reaction that breaks down the waste and releases electrons. Wase says the system can achieve between 70% and 80% conversion of the waste to methane, compared with between 50% and 60% for a typical anaerobic reactor. It says it is between three and 10 times faster than current anaerobic digestion systems, creates 30% more energy and needs a 70% smaller footprint for the reactor. The system is being tested by a number of dairy farms, breweries and distilleries, but Wase is seeking more industrial partners to work with. Diagram of reaction using electrically-active bacteria.

        "body": "Keval Dattani was working as a nuclear engineer on Rolls Royce\u2019s submarine programme, focusing on technology for the UK\u2019s next generation Dreadnaught submarines, when he had a sudden realisation: space technologies were making submarines \u2014 the very technology he had devoted so much of his career to \u2014 obsolete. \u201cWith radar and satellites able to look ever deeper into the sea, submarines could well become useless in the future,\u201d he says. But, Dattani reasoned, many of the technologies developed for submarines could be applied to spacecraft. Keval Dattani, CEO and founder of Space Power. Initially, he switched to working on small modular nuclear power for spacecraft before hitting on another space power idea that might be realisable on a slightly shorter timeframe: providing extra power to space satellites using lasers. This was the idea behind Space Power , the startup Dattani launched in 2019. Think of it a little like sending an extra battery into space to power up startups, much the same way you might provide an extra boost to a flagging mobile phone. Satellites generally use solar power to operate, but their ability to generate and store enough solar power for the functions they need degrades over time. Also, some new technologies such as synthetic aperture radar and thermal imaging are very power-intensive and solar panels struggle to generate enough power for their operation. Satellite operators often need to be sparing in the ways they use their multi-hundred million-dollar satellites because of their concerns over power. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a Bugatti Veyron that you can only drive for half an hour a day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like having a Bugatti Veyron that you can only drive for half an hour a day,\u201d says Dattani. Space Power\u2019s idea is to launch supplementary power sources into space that could give satellites a boost via a laser beam connection when needed. The company, which will exhibiting its technology at the GCV Symposium in London next week, is partnering with BAE Systems, the UK aerospace multinational, to launch a first module into space in 2026. It is seeking to raise a \u00a36.5m ($8.3m) seed round to help fund the build and launch. Dattani and Space Power are one of a number of new spacetech-focused startups that have sprung up over the past decade in the UK and Europe as the region scrambles to address the opportunities opened up by the falling cost of space launches. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX rockets have sent launch costs tumbling and demonstrated how privately-held space companies could speed up development. Space Power, Space Villages, Astron Systems and Stars Edge will among the early-stage startups exhibiting at the GCV Symposium in London in June. Europe\u2019s space efforts have tended to be concentrated in large publicly-funded joint projects like the Arianespace programme, where the latest launcher, Ariane-6, has cost some \u20ac4bn ($4.3bn) and is running four years behind schedule. But it is also seeking to develop smaller, lower-cost and nimbler alternatives to give Europe its own SpaceX-effect. Investment in European spacetech is growing fast. A study by Seraphim, a spacetech VC firm, showed that investment in European spacetech in the first quarter of 2023 \u2014\u00a0some $565m \u2014\u00a0outstripped investment in North America. Isar Aerospace, the German launch vehicle developer, has raised $330m to date, while Rocket Factory Augsburg, another developer of launchers, has raised more than $63m in funding, and UK rocket developer Orbex has raised $130m so far. Spacetech companies exhibiting their systems at the GCV Symposium are younger businesses at seed and pre-seed stage but they demonstrate the wide range of new capabilities that are emerging. Many of them are looking for corporate partners to help accelerate their development. New rocket designs Astron Systems is developing reusable rockets for launching small satellites into space. Eddie Brown began developing the idea while finishing his master\u2019s degree in engineering at Imperial College London. Small rockets can be easier to launch because they encounter less air resistance on reentry \u2014 the higher surface-area-to-volume of a smaller rocket means it has a higher ballistic coefficient. But one of the biggest challenges is that the propulsion systems in smaller rockets wear out faster because they need to operate at higher speeds. Astron has developed a pump system that dramatically reduces wear and tear on shafts and bearings, increasing the lifetime of the rocket. Reusable small rockets would lower the cost of putting satellites into space down to $4,000 per kilo says Brown, dramatically lower than the market leader, US-based Rocket Lab. Astron has raised some pre-seed funding so far but is now seeking to raise a \u00a32m round to grow the team and test a propulsion system. Eddie Brown, CEO of Astron Systems. Image courtesy of Astron Systems. Astron\u2019s competitors on reusable rocket designs include US names such as Stoke Systems, which has raised a total of $175m following a series B funding round last October. But Brown says UK-based startups operate in a favourable environment. \u201cI think the UK has every reason why it could be the future global leader for a lot of these things. Space is a pretty major part of our economy on the satellites and services side of things and we have some of the best talent and engineers coming out of Oxford and Imperial programmes. It\u2019s also a lot cheaper to operate here. Engineer salaries are about half the level of the US,\u201d says Brown. Spacetech startups outside the US also have the advantage, Brown says, that they are outside of the US\u2019s International Traffic in Arms Regulation (Itar) rules, which restrict sales of technology related to defence and the military. Another startup working on a novel engine technology is Stars Edge , a startup co-founded by Sara Alao, a PhD candidate at Cranfield University. The company has a patent-pending technology to create an air-breathing satellite engine, which would allow satellites to be placed into the upper atmosphere rather than into space orbit. Satellites at this range \u2014 some 150km to 200km above sea level, compared with low earth orbit satellites at altitudes of 1,200km \u2014 could be used for much higher-resolution earth observation and for providing telecoms connectivity. Image courtesy of Stars Edge. The problem with upper atmosphere satellites is creating an engine able to overcome the drag of the thin air in upper atmosphere. Propellants \u2014 typically xenon or argon gas \u2014 are quickly depleted. But using the air itself for fuel source means you can have an inexhaustible supply. Alao says that, while she knows of four other companies working on similar projects, she believes that Stars Edge has a unique design that will gain the edge. Staffed by a team of ten people, Stars Edge is seeking to raise a $3.2m seed round to expand staffing and bring a product to market. The team hope to test the system in 2025. Repairs in space Space Villages, a fourth space startup at the GCV Symposium, meanwhile, is leaning into another space need. With some 9,900 satellites in orbit \u2014 and numerous projects underway to put more space stations in orbit over the next decade, there is a growing need for space services \u2014 deliveries, repairs and waste removal. Dutch startup Space Villages, led by chief executive Natalia Lemarquis , develops robots that can carry out repair work in space, starting with satellites. \u201cSatellites have solar panels which must open up their wings, and sometimes these get stuck and can\u2019t provide any power. Even the best satellite in the world won\u2019t work without power. We want to be able to fix that instead of operators having to throw away a $700m satellite,\u201d says Lemarquis. There has been strong demand from the telecoms industry for this kind of service, she says. The company has a 15-person team working on the technology. It is looking for \u00a32m to build a demonstration unit by 2025. It hopes to have a first system in orbit by 2027. While the first uses might be to fix jammed solar panels, the long-term vision is for the company to provide all kinds of services across the growing network of space stations and satellites. \u201cThe industry needs ambitious goals. There are seven active projects to build a space station in orbit \u2014 those space stations will need services, waste management, cargo delivery,\u201d says Lemarquis."
