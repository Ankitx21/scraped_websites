                "LONDON \u2014 Populist British politician Nigel Farage doubled down on claims that the West provoked Russia's war in Ukraine despite facing backlash from Westminster in the crucial final weeks of the U.K. election campaign.",
                "Writing in theTelegraph newspaperon Saturday, the Reform UK leader and Brexit figurehead said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2022 full-scale invasion was \"immoral\" but added that \"if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised if he responds.\"",
                "He was defending comments made Friday in aBBC interview, in which he said that the eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union had given Putin a pretext to tell Russians \"they're coming for us again\" and to go to war.",
                "\"We've provoked this war. Of course it's his fault. He's used what we've done,\" Farage said Friday.",
                "Clarifying his comments Saturday, Farage said he was not and never has been \"an apologist or supporter of Putin,\" but claimed that he \"saw the war coming\" and that the West has \"played into Putin's hands.\"",
                "\"As I have made clear on multiple occasions since then, if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised if he responds. And if you have neither the means nor the political will to face him down, poking a bear is obviously not good foreign policy.\"",
                "He also recalledcomments made to the European Parliamentin 2014 \u2014 shortly after Russia's annexation of Crimea \u2014 in which he questioned NATO's military exercises in Ukraine.",
                "\"Do we actually want to have a war with Putin? Because if we do, we are certainly going about it the right way,\" he said at the time.",
                "Farage's remarks mirror those of close friend and ally former President Donald Trump, who on an episode of the \"All In\" podcast last week reiterated his position that NATO's military expansion was \"provocative\" to Russia, and that the war would not have happened under his leadership.",
                "Reform UK is rapidly gaining popularity followingFarage's return as leaderlast month ahead of the U.K.'s July 4 elections. The right-wing party has 18% of votes, just behind the incumbent Conservatives' 20%,according to YouGov pollingconducted before Farage's comments. Labour is seen with a vast lead at 36%.",
                "The insurgent politician's comments received strong criticism from leaders on both ends of the political spectrum, however.",
                "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Saturdaycondemnedthe remarks as \"completely wrong,\" adding that the position similarly \"plays into Putin's hands.\"",
                "\"This kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain's security, the security of our allies that rely on us, and only emboldens Putin further,\" he told reporters.",
                "Labour leader Keir Starmerdubbed the comments \"disgraceful\" and said that Putin bears \"full responsibility\" for the invasion.",
                "Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson also dismissed the remarks as \"nauseating ahistorical drivel\" and \"Kremlin propaganda\" in apost on X.",
                "Political commentator Timothy Ash, meanwhile, discredited Farage's claim that NATO's 2014 Ukrainian presence had provoked Moscow, noting that support then for Kyiv's membership of the military alliance was \"very low.\"",
                "\"Ukraine was not going to join NATO in 2014, or in 2022, and Moscow knew this. Putin just wanted to create some PR excuse to invade, and Farage is playing to Putin's narrative, a tool for Putin,\" Ash, who is an\u00a0associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, told CNBC via email Monday.",
                "\"Putin invaded Ukraine not because of EU or NATO enlargement but because of a policy of Russian enlargement \u2014 Greater Russia, and Putin's obsession with recreating the USSR, as he stated way back that the collapse of the USSR was the biggest mistake in the 20th century. This was all about Russian colonial ambition and enlargement,\" he added.",
                "In avideo post on XSaturday, the U.K.'s Ministry of Defense said that NATO has previously made \"significant efforts\" to establish a strategic relationship with Russia, including on counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics initiatives."

This comes after FedEx enacted the DRIVE transformation program in an effort to cut costs and consolidate the business.

Rivian, which posted a $1.45 billion loss in the first quarter this year, has been looking to cut costs over the past few months, taking measures like laying off employees and pausing construction on its new factory in Georgia.

                "Home prices have hit yet another record. In April, pricesrose 6.3%compared to April of last year, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. This is the second month in a row that the national index has increased at least 1% over its previous all-time high. Compared with early 2020, home prices are 47% higher, and the median sale price has become five times more than the median household income. Moreover, prices are 26% higher for renters than they were in 2020. This is despite the fact that rent growth has been slowing because of a rise in new apartment units in 2024. Now, half of all renter households are considered \"cost burdened,\" according to the HJCH, as they're spending more than 30% of their income on housing.",
                "Americans are smashing YouTube's like button. According toNielsen's monthly \"The Gauge\" report, YouTubemade up 9.7% of all U.S. viewershipon connected and traditional TVs last month. This is the largest share of TV for a streaming platform that the report hasever seen. Behind YouTube isNetflix, which saw 7.6% of all viewership. YouTube's total viewership among just streamers nears 25% market share. This has led some legacy media and entertainment companies to devise certain strategies to deal with the platform's dominance. According to people familiar with the matter, leaders atDisney, for example, are actively considering adding user-generated content to Disney+, among others. Others like Netflix andWarner Bros. Discoveryare shifting their attention toward the 90% of the viewing world that YouTube doesn't dominate.",

                "Nvidiahas been the hottest story on Wall Street of late, increasing eightfold in value since the end of 2022 and soaringpast $3 trillionin market cap this month.",
                "A 2-year-old startup founded by Harvard dropouts has just raised $120 million in venture funding to try and build a competitive chip and take on Nvidia in artificial intelligence.",
                "Headquartered in Cupertino, California \u2014 home to Apple \u2014Etchedis developing a chip called Sohu, which the company says will be used to train and deploy AI models using \"transformers,\" the core architecture underpinning advancements like OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
                "Co-founder and CEO Gavin Uberti said that as AI develops, most of the technology's power-hungry computing requirements will be filled by customized, hard-wired chips called ASICs. Their efficiency comes in executing only the AI model they were designed to perform, in contrast to general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia that are more capable but are also much costlier.",
                "\"We're making the biggest bet in AI,\" Uberti said in an interview. \"If transformers go away, we'll die. But if they stick around, we're the biggest company of all time.\"",
                "Uberti and his co-founders are aware that it's a high-risk wager, and that they're going up against some of the most richly capitalized and competitive companies on the planet. While $120 million is a lot of money to raise in a series A, it's about how much Nvidia generates in revenue in half a day. Nvidia's sales have more than tripled annually for three consecutive quarters, topping $26 billion in the latest period.",
                "Nvidia has more than 80% of the market share for AI chips, according to estimates. Etched is among a group of startups attracting capital to go after the burgeoning opportunity. Primary Venture Partners and Positive Sum Ventures led the round. Peter Thiel, Stanley Druckenmiller and Cruise founder Kyle Vogt are also backers.",
                "Despite Nvidia's head start and, what some developers describe a moat, new chipmakers are plowing ahead anyway, mainly because the opportunity is so big. Other chip startups taking on Nvidia include Cerebras Systems, which is building a physicallylarger AI chip, and Tenstorrent, which is using a trendy technology called RISC-V to build AI chips.",
                "\"The reason we were so excited about what we're doing, why we dropped out of school and we've convinced so many people to leave these chip projects \u2014 this is the most important thing to be working on,\" said Robert Wachen, Etched's operating chief. \"The entire future of technology is going to be shaped by whether the infrastructure can handle the scale.\"",
                "Semiconductors have traditionally been one of the hardest industries for startups given the long development cycles, the significant capital required to build a chip and the need to engage with a limited number of manufacturing partners, such asTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which is building Etched's chip.",
                "Venture capitalists invested $6 billion in AI semiconductor companies in 2023, up slightly from $5.7 billion in 2022, according to data from PitchBook.",
                "Uberti and Chris Zhu started to work on a chip company after Uberti did a summer internship working on compliers. That put him in contact with the low-level hardware ideas that led to Etched.",
                "The pair dropped out of Harvard in 2022, and added Uberti's college roommate, Wachen. They quickly started hiring chip industry veterans. The company settled in Cupertino, and now has 35 employees. It offers housing stipends to new hires.",
                "\"When ChatGPT came out, and Nvidia stock exploded, and especially when every other model coming out would be a transformer too, we found ourselves in the right place at the right time,\" Uberti said.",
                "Etched is preparing to bring Sohu to market, and the founders say they'll be ready to show something later this year. The startup is also working to secure customers and says that technology companies are eager to check out new AI chips.",
                "For the business to work, companies that are spending billions of dollars on GPUs will need to see some significant savings in building custom chips designed for their specific AI model and be willing to make trade-offs in flexibility.",
                "By specializing on transformers, which moves data in predictable ways from the chip to memory, Etched's Sohu chip can dedicate less space to memory and more to the kinds of transistors that define a chip's raw computing power, Uberti said.",
                "Another aspect of Eteched's efficiency is that the chip has one large core. That results in fewer inefficient calculations done by a part called a streaming multiprocessor to coordinate calculations by different cores.",
                "Uberti says the impact of specialized AI chips could be similar to how custom chips called ASICs, first introduced in 2013 specifically for mining bitcoin or ether, reduced the demand for Nvidia GPUs.",
                "The Etched founders expect the need for chips to run these models will increase, especially once they're used to serve AI software millions of times per minute.",
                "They also say that by hard coding the AI architecture into the chip, their device can reduce the latency of returning answers, unlocking new use cases, such as AI agents or real-time voice conversations. Etched says its chips are more than 10 times faster than Nvidia's GPUs, thanks to its simpler architecture and single use case.",
                "But Etched is taking on some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Nvidia, which have massive development teams and access to the capital needed to secure production and improve their chips on an annual basis.",
                "Etched, which has a countdown timer displayed in its headquarters, has to move faster.",
                "\"The way that we're going to win this specialized AI chip market, and the ones after this, is by being the first product to market,\" Uberti said.",

                "It doesn't view the platform as the same singular threat to viewership that some of its peers do. Netflix famously considers everything that could occupy a user's time, even sleep, as a long-term competitor.",
                "For the time being, Netflix executives consider YouTube as catering to a different consumer need.",
                "\"We have built a hard-to-replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix. Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business,\" Netflix said in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter.",

                "At the same time, \"Cocomelon\"frequently topsNetflix's most-watched list among kids shows.",
                "The more immediate YouTube threat for Netflix comes from an advertising perspective. Netflix is now going head-to-head with YouTube for marketing dollars after introducing its ad-supported tier in November 2022.",
                "Netflix said in May that it has40\u00a0million\u00a0global monthly active usersfor its advertising tier. That's a far cry from YouTube's more than 2 billion monthly active\u00a0users.",

                "If younger users are being conditioned to watch in a certain way, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service wants to give consumers that choice in addition to its long-form movies and TV shows.",
                "But simply curating feeds within a content vertical now feels like a \"YouTube 1.0 strategy\" given how TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have redefined short-form viewing, according to Nathanson.",
                "\"I don't think, at this point, there's a strategy in place among any of the traditional media players to create content for the YouTube generation that's more than just their branded strategy they're doing now,\" said Nathanson. \"The future strategy is to use AI to deliver personalization for each of us. Today, none of the traditional media players has that. That's YouTube 2.0.\"",

                "The company announced a deal earlier this year with MrBeast, whose real name is\u00a0Jimmy Donaldson, to make a reality TV show, \"Beast Games,\" that will pay the winner $5 million in cash. The format will largely borrow from previous MrBeast giveaway videos that pit many contestants against each other for cash, using a \"fast-paced and high-production format,\" asAmazon has promised.",
                "MrBeast's YouTube channel has the most subscribers worldwide at 289 million and expects to take in awhopping $700 million in revenue in 2024, primarily through advertising and brand deals.",
                "But while MrBeast may have crossover appeal, there's skepticism among creators that YouTube celebrities will have success making shows for subscription streaming services. Moreover, the entire Hollywood system may operate too slowly for a younger generation that demands immediate content.",
                "The popularity of YouTube stems from the authentic relationship creators have with their fans, according to Brittany Broski, 27, whoseYouTube channelhas more than 2 million subscribers.",
                "\"I still watch Netflix and HBO, where if I want a good fantasy series or whatever, I know where to go for that. But what YouTube is more concerned with is in this digital age, we've lost a sense of community and a sense of third spaces where we can go to hang out and meet new friends,\" Broski said.",
                "Broski's audience, which she described as Generation Z and young millennial women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, ballooned during the pandemic. Stuck at home with limited social options, hundreds of thousands of people found Broski as they searched for fresh, real-time content.",
                "That personal relationship is YouTube's secret sauce, and it doesn't translate when creators port to other services, Broski said.",
                "\"You're betraying your audience,\" said Broski. \"You're leaving YouTube to act, and then you're not posting online anymore, and you're asking them to wait on a project that's in development for what? A year, two years? People are going to forget about you, girl. That's how the internet works.\"",
                "The business model of YouTube for successful creators incentivizes staying on the platform. YouTube has shared more than $70 billion with its creators over the last three years through itsPartner Program, which shares advertising revenue with more than 3 million channels on the platform.",
                "\"Why would I create a show and sell it to a network when I could just put it on YouTube?\" Broski said. \"You're self-funding, but if the money you're making from AdSense is going right back into your content to make more money, why do you even have to contact that third party?\"",
                "YouTube also benefits from a low barrier to entry to create content and from instant feedback through comments from fans that often help shape future content immediately. That model can't be replicated in a scripted form, where full seasons of TV shows are premade and rolled out on specific schedules.",
                "\"In the traditional industry, it's about proving to other people that the content deserves to be made, deserves to be seen, deserves a marketing campaign, deserves dollars behind it,\" said YouTube star and former professional cyclist Michelle Khare, 31, whosechannelhas more than 4.5 million subscribers. \"With YouTube, if you have the drive, the ability, and in many cases, your phone, you can skip those steps and put it out into a democratic platform where the audience ultimately decides what rises to the top.\"",
                "Warner Bros. Discovery executives are perhaps the least concerned of all legacy media companies about YouTube's rising dominance, which skews younger. Ninety-three percent of teenagerssay they've used YouTube, far outpacing TikTok (63%), Snapchat (60%) and Instagram (59%), according to a 2023 Pew Research study. A2023 surveyfrom marketing firm InMobi found 61% of Gen Z respondents, or those ages 18-24 at the time of the survey, named user-generated content as their favorite form of media.",
                "Warner Bros. Discovery's Max streaming service has moved away from programminggeared toward kids and teenagers\u2014 barring the occasional accidental hit such as \"Euphoria.\" The company's focus on prestige dramas and adult movies is about as far away from YouTube's typical fare as an entertainment company can offer.",
                "Baked into the question of whether YouTube is friend or foe to the media industry is a second query: Will younger consumers simply grow out of YouTube's bread and butter \u2014 the creator-led, non-narrative style of storytelling?",
                "\"My suspicion is that there will be a bit of an aging out,\" said Mayer. \"I think longer form storytelling is hard to replace with super short form storytelling.\"",
                "There may be room for both subscription streamers and YouTube to survive and flourish, with each operating in a lane that doesn't impede the other's too much. Still, YouTube is experimenting with episodic and scripted series to appeal to all audiences \u2014 a direct threat to traditional Hollywood. \"Cobra Kai,\" a spinoff of \"The Karate Kid,\" began on YouTube's ad-free subscription service YouTube Premium, picked up a fan base and then moved to Netflix.",
                "\"There is some amount of conditioning that happens when you become familiar with a certain format that resonates with you, but what we are seeing is it's not so black-and-white between a certain type of audience wanting a certain type of content,\" said Nicky Rettke, YouTube's vice president of product management.",
                "There's also the future threat of artificial intelligence on YouTube. While Hollywood's use of AI is contractually restricted, and was a sticking point ofrecent strike negotiations, there are no current rules for user-generated content. Theoretically, this gives YouTube creators a huge leg up in experimenting with technology that could rival the production values of professional studios, putting even more pressure on traditional media.",

                "Hong Kong is asking service workers to be more courteous and smile in a bid to win back tourists. But high prices and competition from an ascending Shenzhen are bigger issues, experts say.",
                "Long revered for its luxury shopping, restaurants and nightlife, the glitzy financial hub has yet to see visitor numbers recover to levels seen prior to years of disruptions from social unrest and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
                "In response, the Hong Kong government launched a campaign \u2013 titled\"Let's Go the Extra Mile\" \u2013 encouraging frontline staff and members of the public to demonstrate good hospitality and \"reinforce Hong Kong's brand as the best tourism destination.\"",
                "Speaking at a press conference last week,Chief Executive John Lee urged residentsto be more courteous, to smile more and to \"go the extra mile to promote Hong Kong's hospitality.\"",
                "The initiative comes after data showed24 million total visitor arrivalsin the first four months of the year, still at only 60% of the level from the same period in 2019.",
                "Though those numbers marked a significant increase from the previous year, experts warn that full recovery faces greater barriers than grumpy Hong Kongers.",
                "\"One of the biggest problems for the city is simply that we're expensive,\" said Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group, the major property owner and developer in Hong Kong's iconic Lan Kwai Fong nightlife district.",
                "Hong Kong's currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar, which has helped the city's status as an international financial center. However, this can also make it pricey compared to many other Asian economies, especially now amid high interest rates and astrong U.S. dollar.",
                "\"Tourists are finding that other places like Shenzhen and Japan are very, very cheap in comparison,\" said Zeman, who also acts as an advisor to the Hong Kong government.",
                "This dynamic is especially true for mainland Chinese travelers \u2014 with theChinese yuan depreciating significantlyagainst the U.S. and Hong Kong dollars in recent months.",
                "At the same time, Zeman said mainlanders are making up a larger share of tourists in the city as other nationalities have been slower to return. He said this poses a problem for local businesses as mainlanders tend to spend less due to travel preferences, shorter stays and tighter budgets amid economic troubles at home.",
                "While Hong Kong's Culture, Sports, and Tourism Bureau projects the number of tourists to increase this year, it estimated per capita expenditure by overnight visitors to drop to 5,800 Hong Kong dollars ($742.64), down from last year's HK$6,939,according to figures released in the 2024 budget.",
                "LKF, a popular destination among tourists, was particularly hard hit when Hong Kong's borders were closed during the pandemic.",
                "While Zeman says many of the neighborhood's businesses have recovered strongly, there are currently some unused spaces \u2014 once a rare occurrence during pre-pandemic times.",
                "Conversely, locals are increasingly taking trips to the neighboring mainland city of Shenzhen, according to economist Simon Lee Siu-Po, an honorary fellow at the Asia-Pacific Institute of Business at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",
                "\"Both have become equal problems for Hong Kong,\" he said.",
                "While the city's borders were closed during the pandemic, nearbyShenzhen continued to developinto a top-tier Chinese city, Lee said. And newly built high-speed rails and a mega cross-sea bridge have made that journey more convenient than ever.",
                "Shenzhen offers a wide range of food, entertainment and shopping options that can now compete with Hong Kong, said Lee, adding that prices for goods and services in the city are sometimes up to two or three times cheaper.",
                "This dynamic explains why thousands of Hong Kongers flocked to the Shenzhen border for the Easter holiday in late March,leaving the financial hub'srestaurants, bars and shopping centers empty, according to local media.",
                "For the entire month of March, the city of 7.3 million people saw9.3 million residents departfrom its passenger traffic control points.Government data showsthis was the single-highest monthly number of departures since at least 1997 when the city was handed over from British rule to Chinese sovereignty.",
                "Meanwhile, only about3.4 million visitors entered the citythat same month.",
                "These trends have taken their toll on Hong Kong businesses, with retail salescontinuing to fallas local media reports onrapid rates of restaurant closures.",
                "According to a recent survey conducted by the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, 70% of local small and medium-sized firms in the city reported a decline in business performance compared to pre-pandemic levels.",
                "In addition to campaigns like \"Let's Go The Extra Mile,\" Hong Kong authorities have alsoset aside HK$1.09 billionfor citywide events like firework shows to boost tourism and spending.",
                "While the funds will help, combating high prices and competition from Shenzhen will require much more drastic efforts, said Lee and LKF's Zeman."

                "The investment will therefore help Volkswagen in these areas, but the firm is notably behind in the electric vehicle space, he added.",

                "Why do we care so much about 401(k) plans?\u00a0Because it's the main private savings vehicle Americans have for retirement. More than 100 million Americans are covered by these \"defined contribution\" plans, with more than $10 trillion in assets.",
                "First, 2023 was a good year to be an investor.\u00a0 The average total return rate for participants was 18.1%, the best year since 2019.",
                "But to be effective vehicles for retirement, these plans need to:\u00a01) have high participation rates, and 2) hold high levels of savings.",
                "On those fronts, there is good news. John James, managing director of Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group, called it \"a year of progress.\"",
                "Plan participation reached all-time highs.Thanks to a change in the law several years ago, a record-high 59% of plans offered automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans.\u00a0This is a major improvement:\u00a0ipreviously, enrollment in 401(k) plans were often short of expectations because investors had to \"opt-in,\" that is they had to choose to participate in the plan.\u00a0 Because of indecision or simple ignorance, many did not.\u00a0By switching to automatic enrollment, participants were automatically enrolled and had to \"opt-out\" if they did not want to participate.",
                "The result:\u00a0enrollment rates have gone up.\u00a0Plans with automatic enrollment had a 94% participation rate, compared with 67% for voluntary enrollment plans.",
                "Participant saving rates reached all time highs.The average participant deferred 7.4% of their savings. Including employee and employer contributions, the average total participant contribution rate was 11.7%.",
                "A few other observations about Vanguard's 401(k) plan investors:",
                "They prefer equities and target date funds.They love equities over bonds or any other investments.\u00a0The average plan contribution to equities is 74%.\u00a0\u00a0A record-high 64% of all 2023 contributions went into target-date funds, which automatically adjust stock and bond allocations as the participant ages.",
                "They don't trade much.In 2023, only 5% of nonadvised participants traded within their accounts; 95% did no trading at all.\u00a0\"Over the past 15 years, we have generally observed a decline in participant trading,\" Vanguard said, which it partially attributed to increased adoption of target-date funds.",
                "In 2023, the average account balance for Vanguard participants was $134,128, but the median balance (half had more, half had less) was only $35,286.",
                "Why such a big difference between the average and the median?\u00a0Because a small group of investors with large balances pull up the averages. Forty percent of participants had less than $20,000 in their retirement accounts.",
                "Distribution of account balances",
                "Source:\u00a0 Vanguard",
                "A different way to look at the problem is to ask how much people who are retirement age have saved, because it's an indication of how prepared they are for imminent retirement.",
                "Investors 65 years or older had an average account balance of $272,588, but a median balance of only $88,488.",
                "A median balance of $88,488 is not much when you consider older participants have higher incomes and higher savings rates. That is not much money for a 65-year old nearing retirement.",
                "Of course, these balances don't necessarily reflect total lifetime savings. Some have more than one retirement plan because they had other plans with previous employers. Most do have other sources of retirement savings, typically Social Security.\u00a0A shrinking number may also have a pension. Some may have money in checking accounts, or have stocks or bonds outside a retirement account.",
                "So let's do some retirement math.",
                "A typical annual drawdown for a 401(k) account in retirement is about 4%.\u00a0Drawing down 4% of $88,488 a year gets you $3,539 every 12 months.",
                "Next, Social Security.\u00a0As of January 2023,the average Social Security benefit was almost $1,689per month, or about $20,268 per year.",
                "Finally, even though pensions are a vanishing benefit, let's include them.",
                "According to the Pension Rights Center,the median annual pension benefit for a private pensionis $9,262 (government employees have higher benefits).",
                "Here's our yearly retirement budget:",
                "It's certainly possibly to live on $33,000 a year, but this would likely only work if you own your home, have low expenses and live in a low-cost part of the country.",
                "Even then, it would hardly be a robust retirement.",
                "And these are the lucky ones.Only 57% of retirees have a tax-deferred retirement accountlike a 401(k) or IRA. Only 56%\u00a0reported receiving income from a pension.",
                "And that extra income largely determines whether a retiree feels good or bad about their retirement.",
                "In 2023, four out five retirees said they were doing at least okay financially, but this varied tremendously depending on whether retirees had sources of income outside of Social Security.\u00a0Only 52% of retirees who did not have private income said they were doing at least okay financially.",
                "To have a more robust retirement, Americans are just going to have to save more.",
                "One issue is investors still don't contribute the maximum amount allowed.\u00a0Only 14% of participants saved the statutory maximum amount of $22,500 per year\u00a0($30,000 for those age 50 or older).\u00a0The likely reason: most felt they couldn't afford to.",
                "However, only 53% of even those with income over $150,000 contributed\u00a0the maximum allowed.\u00a0 Given that the employee match is \"free money,\" one would think participants in that income bracket would rationally choose to max out their contribution.\u00a0The fact that many still don't suggests that more investor education is needed.",
                "Regardless, it's very dangerous to assume that retirees are going to be bailed out by an ever-rising stock market.\u00a0Another year anywhere near 2022, when the S&P 500 was down 20%, and investor confidence in their financial future will likely deteriorate."

                "\"We are trying still to mold the taxation system for the tourism sector for the future,\" Iceland's Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson told CNBC via videoconference.",
                "\"We would like to lean more towards a system where the user pays. As I see it, we would want to go more toward accession fees to the magnets, as we call them, around the country,\" Benediktsson said.",
                "\"By doing that, we could control traffic. So, at the height of demand, we could have a higher tax where we could control by amending the fees both within the day or between months, or during parts of the year. But this is still in the making.\"",
                "Iceland's government reinstated its so-calledtourism taxat the start of the year, seeking to raise funds for sustainability programs and mitigate the environmental impact of mass tourism.",
                "The levy, which was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic, applies a nominal fee of 600 Icelandic krona ($4.34) to hotel rooms, with varying costs also applied to campsites, mobile homes and cruise ships.",
                "Benediktsson described his predecessor's reintroduction of the tourism tax as an \"important decision\" for the country. However, he says the government needs to go further to find the right balance.",
                "As head of Iceland's pro-business, right-wing Independence Party, BenediktssonreplacedKatrin Jakobsd\u00f3ttiras prime minister in early April. He previously served as prime minister in 2017.",
                "His second stint as the country's leader comes at a time when the country grapples with soaring interest rates, high inflation and a series ofvolcanic eruptions.",
                "Late last month, a volcano in southwestern Iceland erupted for thefifth time since December, spewing lava that once again threatened the coastal town of Grindavik.",
                "The seismic activity also forced the evacuation of one of the country's most visited sites, the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa. The lagoon has sincereopened to touristsafter authorities said the eruption had stabilized.",
                "Iceland's tourism sector has come roaring back from a dip during the coronavirus pandemic. The country \u2014 which has apopulationof around 383,000 \u2014expectsto receive 2.3 million visitors this year, nearly 2.4 million in 2025 and as many as 2.5 million in 2026.",
                "The revenue generated by tourism has been increasingly important to Iceland's economy.",
                "Indeed, the tourism sector accounted for 8.5% of its gross domestic product in 2023, according toStatistics Iceland, citing preliminary figures of the Tourism Satellite Accounts. That's up from 7.5% in 2022 and exceeds the 8.2% average recorded during the pre-Covid period of 2016 through to 2019.",
                "Looking ahead, Benediktsson said the government was working with its own \"sustainability balance check\" to develop its tourism taxation system.",
                "\"We came up with a system under which we look at certain indicators: Is nature in balance in a certain spot? Is society happy with the development? Is that on a green, yellow or red light?\" Benediktsson said.",
                "\"If we see that places are being damaged by the number of people that visit let's say at Geysir where we have the hot springs, we need to take action,\" he added.",
                "\"Those are the things we are trying to develop, and we are trying to follow the indicators and make sure that the industry grows in good acceptance with society but also with nature.\""

                "\"It's important to note that not every new member starts out as a Million Miler,\" Dwight James, Delta's senior vice president of customer engagement and loyalty, said in an interview. \"This notion of premium that we talk about is also aspirational.\"",

                "As a bed and breakfast owner in Taiwan's Hualien County, Chen Rei-jia was used to the minor tremors that sometimes disturbed her work. But this time, something felt different.",
                "\"The shaking grew stronger and lasted longer, and as rescue vehicles arrived, I became frightened,\" she said. \"We heard rocks falling everywhere and saw smoke and dust all around. There were massive landslides in front and behind us.\"",
                "Emerging from her house to survey the damage, Chen had just survived the 7.4 magnitude earthquake that struck Taiwan on April 3 \u2014 the largest tremblor to rock the island in 25 years.",
                "\"I've never experienced such a strong earthquake in my life. It was truly terrifying,\" the 60-year-old said.",
                "Now, survivors like Chen are facing a new challenge. Tourists have canceled their trips en masse, and tour groups have disappeared.",
                "For many residents of Hualien, which relies on tourism for 70% of its economy, the situation is quickly becoming an existential threat.",
                "\"It's dire; there are no tourists,\" said Chen. \"Everyone is too scared to come.\"",
                "The brunt of the earthquake's damage occured in Hualien County, which attracts millions of visitors per year to the towering peaks and waterfalls of its main draw, Taroko Gorge.",
                "But now the previously packed mountain roads and walking paths to the gorge are now blocked with rubble, and vast swaths of Taroko National Park remain closed.",
                "A woman named Lai, who owns a restaurant near the entrance to the gorge, said her once full restaurant now sits empty.",
                "\"We really hope the national park can reopen, but if it doesn't, there's nothing we can do,\" she said. \"It feels like there's no end in sight.\"",
                "Damage to the area also presents a problem for local tour guides like Liang Shiun-chu.",
                "\"Our usual tour package focuses on Taroko,\" he explained. \"Since the earthquake, all our bookings were canceled.\"",
                "The number of visits to Hualien's scenic spots have dropped by 85% since last year, according to local officials. Liang explained that some guides like him now work as taxi drivers and are finding it hard to make ends meet.",
                "\"Business is down to 30%-50% of what it used to be,\" he said. \"Many friends have left Hualien to work elsewhere because it's very tough for our industry here. I've considered moving to another county too.\"",
                "These trends are reflected across different tourism sectors, with the Hualien Hotel Association reporting that post-quake occupancy levels fell to just 5% \u2014 an observation echoed by Howard Yeh, the manager of a local hostel.",
                "\"Around 90% of foreign visitors to Hualien come specifically for Taroko Gorge. With this key attraction temporarily closed, Hualien loses much of its appeal for tourists,\" he said. \"We just have to hold on and keep waiting.\"",
                "Despite the hopes of Hualien's residents, local officials estimate that a return to pre-quake tourism levels could take years.",
                "\"It might take five to 10 years for full recovery,\" Chang Chih-hsiang, director general of Hualien's tourism department, told CNBC Travel.",
                "To speed up the recovery process, Taiwan's local and national governments have introduced programs to support local businesses and encourage visitors to return. The government is guaranteeing loans and subsidizing interest rates for local businesses who need loans.",
                "From July, visitors to Hualien County will also be eligible to receive up to $1,000 New Taiwan dollars ($31) in accommodation subsidies, with tour agencies receiving up to NT$20,000 ($618).",
                "Despite this, locals worry these measures may not be enough. Stephanie Zhang, the head of the Hualien Hotel Association, said her organization predicts, in a best-case scenario, that hotel occupancy levels will return to 40-50% this summer.",
                "Continuing news coverage about the quake, social media clips of collapsed buildings and the some 1,500 aftershocks that have hit Taiwan since the initial quake haven't helped restore traveler confidence.",
                "Even if visitors wanted to visit Hualien, accessing the county is more difficult than before. Some 70% of tourists reach Hualien from northern Taiwan, explained Chang but the quake damaged the road that connects the city to Taipei.",
                "The road still functions at specific times of day, and the county is still accessible via train and plane, but the damage has taken a toll.",
                "Hualien's tourism office is working to restore the city and promote Hualien as a safe tourist destination, said Chen.",
                "\"If we do not reverse this trend and rebuild tourists' confidence in Hualien, the loss is estimated to be around NT$15 billion by the end of the year,\" he said.",
                "The effects of the earthquake have reverberated far beyond Hualien's tourism sector. \"Tourism is the lifeblood of Hualien,\" explained Chang.",
                "When the tourism industry suffers, so does the rest of the region.",
                "Markets, which usually serve locals, are suffering because locals aren't making money, explained a market vendor Cheng Wen-zhong. \"If tourists don't come, our business suffers significantly.\" Lin Ya-mi, a fish vendor at the town's wet market, said business had dropped by two-thirds.",
                "Despite that, Hualien's residents hope that tourists will soon come back, so that life can return to normal.",
                "Standing in her empty restaurant at the entrance to Taroko Gorge, Lai Sui-er explained that she still has faith in the future.",
                "\"If things don't work out here, we'll look elsewhere. And if that still doesn't work, we'll find jobs. No matter how much we earn, as long as we can make a living, we can manage by being frugal,\" she said, wiping tears from her eyes.",
                "\"There is hope,\" she said. \"We will find a way.\"",

                "Despitevoting for changeat last year's annual meeting, shareholders in medical device makerMasimohave seen their governance concerns go largely unresolved, according to activist investor Politan Capital Management.",
                "With just a month until the 2024 annual meeting, Politan, which has already won two board seats, is looking to go further. Led by Quentin Koffey, Politan hasnominated two further directorsto the company's board, and says that without their election, management will continue to operate without oversight. Masimo founder andCEO Joe Kianisays if shareholders vote him out, he won't come back.",
                "\"This is shareholders' last chance at meaningful change,\" Politan wrote in a letter to Masimo shareholders on Wednesday, laying out its case to investors ahead of the meeting. A copy of the letter and attached presentation was obtained by CNBC.",
                "Masimo, best known for its successful patent litigation over theAppleWatch, was initially targeted by Politan last year due to what the activist viewed as bad management, a lack of independent board leadership and a flawed acquisition that took the company away from its core business.",
                "Swayed by Politan's arguments, investors voted last year to elect Koffey and Michelle Brennan to the board.",
                "But governance improvements have fallen short of what shareholders deserve, Koffey wrote in the letter, noting that Masimo's board \"does not review, approve or see a budget.\"",
                "\"This results in Mr. Kiani spending whatever he wants however he wants,\" Koffey wrote.",
                "For this year's meeting, Politan has nominated Darlene Solomon, formerly chief technology officer atAgilent, and Bill Jellison, who was chief financial officer atStryker.",
                "Masimo's stock has continued to slide, falling 28% since last year's meeting, while the S&P 500 has gained 26% over that stretch. Politan says it's been stymied from making any meaningful changes to how the company is run, and says Masimo's board still has no oversight over CEO Kiani or the direction of the company.",
                "The activist says that with proper governance, the company could show a $10 billion increase in shareholder value. Its current market cap is $7 billion.",
                "\"Fundamentally, what this upcoming vote is about is simple: fixing the prolonged and deliberate refusal by Masimo to permit independent oversight,\" Koffey wrote in the latest letter.",
                "Last year's proxy fight was hotly contested and expensive. Masimo took aggressive steps to fend off Politan, introducing bylaws to force the firm to reveal its shareholder list.Many of those efforts were rejected by a Delaware judge.Kiani threatened to quit if Koffey was elected.",
                "A representative for Masimo did not immediately return a request for comment.",
                "Kiani remains CEO and many of the same themes persist. But in this year's proxy fight, Kiani sits in one of the director seats that Politan is targeting.",
                "\"Shareholders spoke,\" Politan said in its presentation. \"But nothing changed.\"",
                "A key part of Politan'spitch to shareholders last yearrevolved around Masimo's $1 billionacquisitionof Sound United, the owner of high-end audio brands like Bowers & Wilkins and Denon. Politan highlighted the 2022 deal as an example of what happens under a poor governance structure. Masimo'sstock plunged37% after the purchase was announced.",
                "While Kiani has continued to claim that the tie-up would help Masimo bring its medical tech into homes, the company said in March that it would heed investor concerns andspin offthe consumer brands.",
                "But the matter is hardly resolved. Politan said in its Wednesday letter that Kiani dissolved the spinoff's special committee, helmed by Koffey, after it \"rejected or modified many\" of the CEO's demands.\u00a0For the new company, Kiani had been seeking licenses to Masimo's valuable intellectual property, the Masimo name, its corporate headquarters and jet as well as a $150 million cash infusion, according to filings from both the activist and the company.",
                "Politan also highlighted what it called \"egregious compensation\" and \"lavish\" spending by Mr. Kiani, pointing to Caribbean and European vacations on Masimo's corporate jet and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock pledging.",
                "Kiani told CNBC earlier this year that a third party was interested in a joint venture, but he didn't provide specifics. Koffey said that he and Masimo's board were told the name of the potential partner only after a tentative deal had been signed. Shareholders still haven't been informed.",
                "\"Politan wants a separation done right,\" Koffey wrote in Wednesday's letter. \"We have been asking for a strategic review of the Sound United business and consumer healthcare spending for over 18 months.\"",
                "Politan also noted in the letter that investors have opposed the company's pay practices and director choices for more than a decade.",
                "Masimo has ranked at the bottom 0.1% of say-on-pay votes among companies in the Russell 3000 for as long as that metric has existed, Politan noted. Kiani would be entitled to a change-in-control payout of more than $400 million should he lose his board seat or if the company completes the spinoff in his preferred fashion, according toregulatory filings.",
                "Politan says its campaign needs to succeed because management's intractability will make it hard for another shareholder to mount a similar push in the future.",
                "\"For more than two years, Politan has navigated unprecedented impediments thrown up by Masimo's board,\" the activist said. \"We doubt any shareholder will ever try to do so again.\"",

                "On Tuesday, Walmart's CFO warned investors at a conference that the second quarter was going to be the retailer's \"most challenging quarter\" for the year.\u00a0He isn't alone among chief financial officers sounding a little down about what's taking place in the economy right now, and uncertain about what comes next. Fears among top corporate CFOs about shaky consumer demand have hit a six-quarter higher, according to the latest CNBC CFO Council survey, with the Q2 survey the first time since the beginning of 2023 that over half of CFOs cited consumer demand as the biggest external risk to their business.",
                "Consumer demand fears among CFOs have been rising in recent quarters, and match evidence from the market across sectors, withfast-food chains rushing outvalue menus andcar dealers having more difficultymoving inventory. The 54% of CFOs who cited consumer demand as the biggest risk is up from 18% a year ago, and 37% last quarter.",
                "On a recent call of CFO Council members during which they are granted anonymity to speak freely, a financial services CFO shared data that their firm collects showing that while consumers are still traveling and eating out, the transaction values for those activities are down. \"They're not pulling back entirely, but they're most certainly finding less costly ways to accomplish their goals,\" the CFO said.\u00a0Food sector CFOs on the call said they are heavily focused on value right now, with one specifically invoking the term \"value war.\"",
                "The quarterly CFO Council survey reflects a sampling of views from chief finance officers across the market and sectors, with 24 respondents included in the Q2 survey, conducted June 3\u2013June 20.",
                "While elevated, a cautious view of the consumer has not been uncommon among this CFO group in recent years, given their knowledge of Federal Reserve policy history and the impact of higher rates on past economies, from weak demand to layoff spirals. Still, their current view of the Fed and the interest rate environment has not changed to as significant a degree as their view of the consumer. In fact, the percentage of CFOs who rate the job the Fed is doing as \"good\" is now at its highest level ever \u2013 70%. But there were a few notable moves in other survey numbers related to monetary policy and the rate outlook.",
                "Last quarter, almost half of CFOs forecast a 10-year yield that would dip below 4% by the end of the year. Not anymore, with nearly 92% expecting the 10-year to remain above 4% through Dec. 31.",
                "As the market continues its debate over how to readthe latest inflation numbers, andwhat the Fed is making of the data, CFOs taking the survey continue say inflation will remain elevated for a longer period of time \u2014 consistent with a view held in recent quarterly surveys. But now, CFOs have pushed out their inflation view even further. Roughly 42% of CFOs surveyed say inflation will not reach the Fed's target of 2% until 2026, significantly higher than any other response \u2014 29% said the first half of 2025.",
                "The largest percentage of CFOs (38%) still expect a rate cut from the Fed in September, but that is closely followed by 29% who don't think any cut is coming in 2024. Still, between forecasts for a cut in either September, November or December, one cut before the end of the year remains the majority position,consistent with the Fed's own view.\u00a0At the Fed's recent FOMC meeting, ChairJerome Powell saidthe central bank isn't ready to start cutting rates but noted that while inflation is still running too high, the pace of price increases has come down \"significantly.\"",
                "CFOs' overall view of the economy has slipped, but isn't dire. One-third of CFOs still see a soft landing ahead, but that is down from almost half (48%) who felt good about the soft landing scenario last quarter. While that has dropped, it's still twice the level of confidence in a soft landing compared to what CFOs expected in the year-ago survey. A little over half of CFOs (54%) say the economy is either in a recession or will enter one between the second half of this year and second half of 2025. And when asked to choose a trend for the stock market, more CFOs are now inclined to forecast a pullback, with just under 60% saying it is more likely theDow Jones Industrial Averagefalls back to 35,000 rather than reach 45,000 for the first time.",
                "In the lead up to the election, CFOs say interest rates and inflation remain the biggest issues for them, versus other political issues in the news, including immigration, tariffs and tax policy. And while it may be early, CFOs were not shy about calling the election and who will inherit those issues into 2025: 58% think Donald Trump will be elected president. Only 12% think Biden will prevail, while the remaining respondents said they were unsure."

                "If you are in Virginia sweltering and falling behind on your utility bill, you will have additional options to keep the air conditioner humming, but not until July 1. That's when Virginia joins the small but growing ranks of states protecting disconnects duringextreme heat. Such protections have been around for cold weather for decades, but asthe global rise in temperatureshits records, advocates say more must be done to shield customers from having utilities cut; often, existing legislation isn't enough.",
                "Virginia State Senator Lashrecse Aird,(D-Petersburg), a legislative sponsor of the state's new utility bills law, said her support for the legislation was rooted in her own experience of having utilities disconnected when she was younger. \"It was not a pleasant experience,\" Aird said. \"And I carry that with me.\"",
                "Now, she says, the stakes are higher.",
                "\"We have to account for extreme heat outside the normal months of the year that are increasingly hotter now,\" Aird said. \"As long as we continue to fail to address climate change and increased temperatures, we have to be deliberate and intentional,\"\u00a0she said, and she added that implies the need for protective laws. \"Our country is on fire; the world is on fire. I predict we will see more places experiencing heat crises and heat emergencies. We need to have these policies in place; that is where we are heading from a pure weather standpoint.\"",
                "The Virginia law, which Aird said the utilities \"fought tooth and nail,\" forbids disconnections when the temperature exceeds 92 degrees. Regardless of temperature, the bill also prohibits power companies from performing utility shutoffs on Fridays, holidays, state holidays, or days immediately preceding a state holiday. Such shutoffs could leave someone without power for a prolonged period while the utility's customer service office is closed.",
                "\"We had to write those in because we found that is what was happening,\" Aird said.\u00a0\"They did not want to have the state spell out their process for reconnection. Everyone has a different administrative structure.\"",
                "Too many states have no protections from utility company disconnects for consumers, according to David Konisky, a professor in the environmental studies department at\u00a0IndianaUniversity and director of the Energy Justice Lab, and he says climate change is forcing a new conversation about the issue.",
                "The Energy Justice Lab created a\"Disconnect Dashboard\"showing utility disconnect data in each state (not every state reports data) and existing shutoff-shielding legislation, if any, in place.\u00a0Part of making the dashboard was overlaying forecast excessive heat days along with protections that exist or don't exist and factoring in climate change. The outlook is grim, Konisky says. Nearly three million people have their electricity shut off annually because they cannot afford to pay monthly bills, according to the Energy Justice Lab.",
                "\"There are two ways to think about it: how hot is it going to get today, yes, but what is really dangerous is when it does not cool off at night, when you have a persistent period of warm nights, when people are unable to cool their bodies, that is when you have high incidents of heat exhaustion,\" Konisky said, adding that lack of cooling like air conditioning exacerbates it.",
                "Legislation like Virginia's is welcome, but often, the laws don't go far enough, according to Konisky. They are typically limited to state-regulated power companies (Virginia's is more expansive than other states') or have subjective or ambiguous disconnection criteria. Konisky says utility customers must work with them instead of being cut off.",
                "Covid-19 led many states to issue temporary orders during stay-at-home mandates to require power to remain on, but most of these orders have been gradually eliminated. A majority of states (40) have statutory-based utility disconnection protections that cover specific times of year and vulnerable populations, according to the Energy Justice Lab.",
                "As of 2021, 29 states had seasonal protections and 23 had temperature-based disconnection protections, but Konisky's research shows that these do not fully prohibit disconnections, often putting the onus on customers to demonstrate eligibility for an exemption, such as medical need. Most states (46), plus Washington D.C., give customers the option to set up a payment plan as an alternative to disconnection, though interest may be steep and income-based repayment is not often an option.",
                "\"A lot could be done to make energy more affordable where a shut off is necessary,\" Konisky said. \"There is creative rate making, payment structures. They need to be more aggressive in offering payment plans, as opposed to shutting off, help customers access energy assistance. There are a lot of activities that would be advisable and preferable before we engage in the practice of shutoffs which can have terrible consequences for people.\"",
                "His research shows that power companies disconnect plenty during warm weather. Using publicly available data, he found that Indiana customers, for instance, experienced 50,000 disconnects between June and August 2023. \"So they are happening during the very warm months,\" Konisky said. \"This situation is likely to get worse, particularly in states where we would not have historically worried about it during the summer.\"",
                "One of the states where, historically, one would have not had to worry as much about heat is Oregon.\u00a0But don't tell that to residents bracing for 90-degree days this week.\u00a0When Brandi Tuck, executive director of Portland-based social services organization Path Home, moved to Oregon 20 years ago, the state was known for its temperate climate of mild winters and cool summers. Not anymore.",
                "\"We never heard the term'heat dome,'\" Tuck said, referring to a once-obscure meteorological term that has morphed into a new term for a heat wave.",
                "\"As climate change occurs, we are getting hotter and hotter summers, and we get heat domes here.\u00a0We had one last summer that resulted in deaths; it gets intense,\" Tuck said. In 2021, Portland reached a searing 117 degrees during a fierce heatwave.\u00a0On the other end of the spectrum, Tuck said Oregon is experiencing longer, colder winters.\u00a0Oregon does have laws in place to protect utility customers during cold snaps, but not during heat waves.\"The challenge is we have commodified life-sustaining requirements. We are a first-world development country, but we have commodified things like power, air-conditioning, and lighting,\" Tuck said.",
                "Path Home often helps those facing imminent power disconnects. Power cuts in rental properties, Tuck says, are often followed by evictions, and helping with utilities is one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent homelessness. As Oregon's weather swings, Tuck says the power companies cannot be depended on to police themselves.",
                "\"We need legislation,\"\u00a0 Tuck said.",
                "Disconnects hit the lowest-income people disproportionately hard, and people already struggling to pay their utility bills are often charged a \"reconnect fee,\" or a deposit after a cutoff. In Ohio, for instance, the utility may require you to pay a deposit of up to one month's estimated charges plus 30%.",
                "These costs can be a problem for those who get disconnected.\u00a0Felix Russo, pastor of the New Life Mission in Hamilton, Ohio, says that by the time needy people come to him to help with their utilities, they are usually days away from having their power disconnected.\u00a0Russo then calls the power companies and tries to negotiate on behalf of the person or tries to match them with a social service agency that can provide funds.\u00a0But it's an uphill battle. \"All of our systems are strained,\" Russo said.",
                "Power companies insist that disconnections are a last resort and that additional legislation and regulation aren't needed.",
                "\"We understand our customers may face financial hardships throughout the year, so I want to be clear that disconnecting customers for non-payment is an absolute last resort,\" said Aaron Ruby, manager of media relations for Dominion Energy, the main power supplier in Virginia.\u00a0He said that Dominion has numerous bill payment assistance options to help customers avoid disconnections, including budget billing, extended payment plans, EnergyShare bill payment assistance, and home weatherization programs. The EnergyShare program, for example, Ruby said, offers up to $600 a year in heating assistance and $300 a year in cooling assistance for eligible customers.",
                "Ruby said that Dominion Energy has already started complying with the new law, dispelling fears that they would initiate a rash of disconnections before July 1.",
                "\"Disconnects for nonpayment were suspended Tuesday and Wednesday in observation of Juneteenth, and we will continue monitoring the forecast for the upcoming heat wave,\" Ruby said, adding that they will comply with the new law. \"We will comply with the law and suspend nonpayment-related disconnects in parts of our service area where forecasted temperatures reach 92 degrees or higher.\"",
                "A spokesperson for Charlotte-based Duke Energy, the nation's second-largest utility company, said it has \"long-standing policies to temporarily suspend disconnecting a customer's service for nonpayment to help protect our customers,\" on days when the weather is expected to be extremely hot or extremely cold. Duke monitors extreme weather events such as hurricanes or winter storms, evaluates them case-by-case, and temporarily suspends disconnection for nonpayment.",
                "From Virginia legislator Aird's perspective, legislation is needed not just for the customer but also to protect the power companies from themselves, a point she made in the starkest terms. \"Your goal at the end of the day is to have a customer and give someone the ability to pay; if they are dead, then the power company doesn't have a customer.\"",
                "The new legislation doesn't go far enough to ensure people's safety in extreme weather, according to Aird, but it was a good first step. \"We erred on the side of something is better than nothing,\" Aird said."

But the combination of extreme weather, such as flooding and drought, and greening has dramatically reduced crop production.",
                "In a report published on May 10, Fundecitrus forecast that Brazil was set to produce 232.4 million boxes of oranges in the 2024 to 2025 season. That represents a 24% decline when compared to the previous cycle.",
                "\"Restoring normal stock levels in Brazil will require several consecutive good harvests.

                "Citrus farmers have stepped up their actions against greening in Brazil in recent months, Padilla said, noting that greening was more prevalent in smaller groves, where agriculturalists tend to have limited resources to remove infected trees at the rates required to keep the disease under control.",
                "\"Another effect of citrus greening is that farmers will be incentivized to harvest early, reducing the potential for higher fruit drop rates, which could have a negative effect on fruit quality, and potentially diminish juice yields,\" Padilla added."

                "Back in February, used electric vehicle prices dipped below used gasoline-powered vehicle prices for the first time ever, and the pricing cliff keeps getting steeper as car buyers reject any \"premium\" tag formerly associated with EVs.",
                "Thedecline has been dramaticover the past year. In June 2023, average used EV prices were over 25% higher than used gas car prices, but by May, used EVs were on average 8% lower than the average price for a used gasoline-powered car in U.S. In dollar terms, the gap widened from $265 in February to $2,657 in May, according to an analysis of 2.2 million one to five year-old used cars conducted by iSeeCars.\u00a0Over the past year, gasoline-powered used vehicle prices have declined between 3-7%, while electric vehicle prices have decreased 30-39%.",
                "\"It's clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles,\" iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer stated in an iSeeCars report published last week. Electric power is now a detractor in the consumer's mind, with EVs \"less desirable\" and therefore less valuable than traditional cars, he said.",

Used BMW prices exceed prices for comparable, all-electric, Tesla vehicles by a significant amount, according to iSeeCars. A Tesla Model 3 cost $2,635 more than a BMW 3 Series in May 2023, but by May of this year, was priced over $4,800 less than the 3 Series.",
                "More people are selling their used EVs today than ever before, at least partially because the market is bigger than every before. In 2022, 176,918 used EVs were purchased in the U.S. In May alone, that number increased to over 45,000. There are many more vehicles in the used market than new car market, andused vehicle valuedoes rapidly depreciate as a rule. A one-year-old used car is, on average, priced at 80% of the same car sold new. As more EVs enter the used market at lower prices, the EV market does become available to a wider market of potential first-time EV owners.",
                "There are reasons why EV premiums are more likely to decline in the used market regardless of the recent consumer perception shift: battery technology is continually getting better, increasing range on new models, andconsumers also worry about batteries degradingover time. Newer models have longer ranges and improved battery life with temperature control for charging. Between 30-50% of the value embedded in an EV is the battery.\u00a0But offsetting that is the fact that EVs have lower overall owner costs, from fuel to maintenance, and owners of used EVs can qualify for federal tax credits.",
                "A key factor in the recent decline in used EV priceshas been Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who began an industry price war as demand slumped by cutting prices in 2023, with price cuts on Model X, Y and S vehicles continuing into 2024.\u00a0Scott Case, the CEO of Recurrent, a startup that measures EV battery performance for auto consumers, recently told CNBC that declining used Tesla prices correspond to new Tesla price drops, followed by decreasing prices across used EV competitors.",

                "Declining market demand for EVs and a lack of infrastructure have pushed many auto companies to step back from aggressive EV rollouts, and put more promotion behind hybrid models, which are experiencing a boom. General Motors recentlycut its expected sales and production of EVsfrom a 200,000\u2013300,000 range to 200,000-250,000. EVs made up less than 3% of GM's Q1 sales.Ford has faced lossesfrom its Model E electric vehicle rollout, even as combined hybrid and EV sales rose in May. Ford has now made the decision to rescind a program announced during the initial EV boom thatrequired Ford dealersto make significant investments in EV infrastructure to be able to sell electric vehicles.",

                "SixteenNobel Prize-winning economists signed a joint letter Tuesday warning of what they see as economic risks if former PresidentDonald Trumpwere to serve a second term, including reheated inflation.",
                "\"While each of us has different views on the particulars of various economic policies, we all agree that Joe Biden's economic agenda is vastly superior to Donald Trump's,\" the economists wrote. Axios wasfirst to reportthe letter.",
                "\"There is rightly a worry that Donald Trump will reignite this inflation, with his fiscally irresponsible budgets,\" wrote the group of politically progressive academics.",
                "Trump has so far proposed making his first-termtax cutspermanent, imposing universaltariffson all imports, with a China-specific tariff rate between 60% and 100%, and pressuring the independent Federal Reserve Board to cut interest rates.",
                "Economists and Wall Street analysts alike have predicted that any or all of those proposals could reinflate prices, which remain vulnerable despite cooling slightly in recent months.",
                "Joseph Stiglitz, who won the Nobel Prize in 2001, led the effort to publish Tuesday's letter. His co-signers include George Akerlof, Sir Angus Deaton, Claudia Goldin, Sir Oliver Hart, Eric Maskin, Daniel McFadden, Paul Milgrom, Roger Myerson, Edmund Phelps, Paul Romer, Alvin Roth, William Sharpe, Robert Shiller, Christopher Sims and Robert Wilson.",
                "\"Nonpartisan researchers, including at Evercore, Allianz, Oxford Economics, and the Peterson Institute, predict that if Donald Trump successfully enacts his agenda, it will increase inflation,\" the economists wrote.",
                "Stiglitz said he felt compelled to initiate the letter based on a flurry of recent polling in which voters said they trusted Trump over Biden to manage the U.S. economy.",
                "\"A lot of people think Trump would be better for the economy than Biden,\" Stiglitz told CNBC in an interview. \"I thought it would be important for Americans to know that at least a group of credible economists differs very strongly.\"",
                "The timing of Tuesday's letter was notable, coming just days before Trump and Biden are scheduled to face off in the first presidential debate of the general election. The Atlanta debate hosted by CNN is expected to dedicate significant time to the economy and specifically, inflation.",
                "The Trump campaign staunchly rejected the Nobel economists' position.",
                "\"The American people don't need worthless out of touch Nobel peace prize winners to tell them which president put more money in their pockets,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNBC.",
                "Under Trump, theDecember year-over-year Consumer Price Indexfell during three of his four years in office.",
                "The Biden campaign seized the opportunity to tout the letter on Tuesday: \"Top economists, Nobel Prize winners, and business leaders all know America can't afford Trump's dangerous economic agenda.\"",
                "The Nobel laureates' letter contained a distinct political perspective, as well as an economic one.",
                "Many of these economists signed a similarSeptember 2021 letterexpressing support for President Joe Biden's Build Back Better package. Critics at the time argued that the massive spending packages would drive up inflation.",
                "At the time, Stiglitz observed that some people \"invoked fears of inflation as a reason to not undertake\" the Build Back Better investments. \"This view is short-sighted,\"he said in a press release.",
                "This time around, Stiglitz and his co-signers took a more cautious approach to inflation, after the U.S. economy has spent that last year recovering from 2023's scorching inflation spike.",
                "The higher prices were partly due to pandemic-era supply chain snarls, which left the global trade system unable to meet the pent up demand of American consumers.",
                "But this demand was itself the result of a U.S. economy that weathered the pandemicbetter than many had anticipated it would \u2014 thanks to generous government subsidieslike the expanded Child Tax Credit and the Paycheck Protection Program.",
                "Since then, Stiglitz said, Biden has helmed a successful effort to cool those inflation peaks.",
                "\"Inflation has been brought down, actually, remarkably quickly,\" he said. \"I would say it's because of Biden.\"",
