        "body_content": "Shortly after HSBC swooped on the carcass of Silicon Valley Bank in March of last year, picking up around 50 U.S. bankers and an $8 billion U.K. loan book, the London-headquartered bank\u2019s management drew up plans to win over the biggest venture capitalists in the U.S. that had historically been SVB customers. Fifteen months on, the bank can show progress in a couple of areas, including venture lending. HSBC has snared roughly 300 startup companies as clients over the last year, a figure management is hoping to grow into thousands, according to two people briefed on the bank\u2019s strategy. \u201cThis is a startup in many ways for us,\u201d said HSBC\u2019s head of U.S. commercial banking, Wyatt Crowell. \u201cWe\u2019re making an investment, and we\u2019re going to build and make a return on that investment.\u201d HSBC is one of the biggest banks in the world, but up to now its profile has been lower in the U.S. than in Hong Kong and the U.K., its two largest markets. Until recently, the firm\u2019s commercial banking division in the U.S. focused mainly on multinational companies, providing lending, cash management, foreign exchange and trade financing services. HSBC\u2019s venture capital and startup business was relatively piecemeal until last year, when it snatched up the team of SVB bankers. Those bankers are based in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York and Boston, and the bank plans on expanding its U.S. innovation banking team to 100 people, with roughly half that number hired by the end of the year. HSBC has also hired bankers in Israel, is hiring in Hong Kong and China and will likely add bankers in other countries for tech banking, Crowell said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t do it without creating something of critical mass in the U.S. It\u2019s the biggest innovation economy by far,\u201d Crowell said. Innovation Economy HSBC has made the biggest impact in venture lending, where it has aggressively expanded by offering borrowers cheaper terms than its competitors, according to venture debt advisers. Before March of last year, HSBC was making only a dozen loans a year to later-stage companies. The number of deals tripled within the 12 months after HSBC hired the SVB bankers, Crowell said. By the fourth quarter of 2023, HSBC was on pace to be the most active venture lender among banks by a big margin, according to debt advisory firm Armentum Partners. Venture lending is risky. Startups borrowing venture debt typically don\u2019t have revenue, which means repayment is more uncertain than with other business loans. Lenders such as HSBC look for a commitment from investors that the company will raise more funds as a form of collateral that can be used to repay the loan. Last year the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency warned banks against lending money to companies that don\u2019t generate enough cash flow to repay the debt in a reasonable time frame. HSBC\u2019s venture lending business is run through a subsidiary isolated from the bank\u2019s deposits, which puts it outside the OCC\u2019s jurisdiction. HSBC held talks with the Federal Reserve about its plans for the subsidiary, and the regulator did not object to the bank\u2019s strategy, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. HSBC is also offering capital call lines of credit to VC firms, filling voids left by the collapse of SVB. HSBC is also developing wealth management solutions designed specifically for GPs to complement its services aimed at wealthy individuals. Relationship Building At the same time, HSBC is slowly building relationships with prominent VC firms. \u201cWe\u2019ve carefully tiered them in a gold, silver, bronze format, in terms of where we want to spend our time,\u201d said Crowell. \u201cThe idea is to add as many good clients as possible and to cover a good group of the top VCs across the country.\u201d One top tier VC firm  HSBC has targeted is Andreessen Horowitz. HSBC was the exclusive banking sponsor of the firm\u2019s Tech Week conference in New York earlier this month. That included an event at the bank\u2019s new Hudson Yards headquarters with Zane Lackey, an Andreessen Horowitz general partner, and David Sabow, HSBC\u2019s head of U.S. innovation banking, who joined from SVB last year as part of the mass poaching. In May, HSBC hosted Scott Kupor, an Andreessen Horowitz general partner, along with several other venture capitalists from Cendana Capital, Lux Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners, at a California event to introduce Asia-based high-net-worth clients to U.S. venture capitalists. \u201cObviously there is a relationship with Andreessen, which is one of the bigger players. We are in dialogue with a lot of these folks,\u201d Crowell said. Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to requests for comment. Snagging startups as clients could also tee up business for HSBC down the road if they stick with the bank when they sell or go public. That would boost its investment banking business, where HSBC ranks 14th in initial public offerings for the year to date, with just two deals\u2014far behind JPMorgan Chase, which has book-run 14 IPOs, according to figures provided by Dealogic. HSBC isn\u2019t the only bank looking for an in with younger companies to win tech IPOs down the road. It\u2019s competing with Stifel and JPMorgan, which have also aggressively entered the sector. But HSBC is hoping its vast overseas business will give it an edge. The firm\u2019s private banking and wealth management business, which has long and deep ties to Asia. It was overseeing more than $360 billion in assets at the end of 2023, which could come in handy for VC firms looking to fundraise. HSBC could also sell startups that expand internationally on its cash management and foreign exchange services. Down the road, the bank could put together a fund of funds composed of its U.S. VC clients, Crowell said, which it could sell to wealthy overseas investors. \u201cIt\u2019s the relationship with the [VC firms] around their portfolio companies that I think is critical,\u201d Crowell said. \u201cAt the end of the rainbow, these companies go public or they sell themselves.\u201d Correction: By the fourth quarter of 2023, HSBC was on pace to be the most active venture lender among banks by a big margin, according to Armentum Partners. An earlier version of this story incorrectly cited Armentum's estimate of HSBC's market share.

        "heading": "Google Develops Challenger to Meta\u2019s Chatbots and Character.AI",
        "author_name": "Julia Hornstein",
        "publish_date": "Jun 24, 2024, 2:54pm PDT",
        "body_content": "Google wants chatbots that people can hang with\u2014not just pelt with questions. The search engine giant has been developing a product for creating and conversing with customizable chatbots, which could be modeled on celebrities or made by users, two people with direct knowledge of the project said. The bots would be similar to the online personalities from Meta Platforms and startup Character.AI, based on celebrities like football star Tom Brady and TV character Tony Soprano. Staff have discussed launching the new chatbots as soon as this year, one of the people said. The plans, which haven\u2019t been previously reported, speak to how tech giants are looking for ways to turn breathtaking advances in generative artificial intelligence into apps that can keep consumers hooked. Google spokesperson Justin Burr said, \u201cGoogle Labs is a place where we experiment with future AI product ideas\u2014some of which may be integrated into our products at some point, some of which will not.\u201d He declined to comment directly on the chatbots. Consumers rushed to try the Character.AI and Meta chatbots soon after their release. But as the novelty has worn off, consumer interest has cooled. At the same time, Google has been under pressure to move faster with AI-driven products to keep up with big tech rivals like Meta as well as startups. The Google project is distinct from Gems, a feature announced in May that allows subscribers to Gemini Advanced\u2014the paid version of Google\u2019s primary chatbot, which gives users access to more features\u2014to create personas, such as a coding partner or a gym buddy, to help with specific tasks. Ryan Germick, a longtime designer at Google known for his work on the Google Doodles that appear on the company\u2019s search home page, is leading the project as part of the Google Labs team, which works on experimental AI products, the people said. Around 10 Google employees have been working on it. The chatbot will likely appear on the Google Labs website if the company makes it accessible to the public. As currently conceived, Google\u2019s Gemini AI model would power the chatbots. Users would be able to create their own chatbots by describing its personality and appearance. That feature is similar to Character.AI, which also allows users to give the chatbots elaborate backstories and to specify what their voices sound like in audio conversations. As part of the effort, Google has discussed striking partnerships with influencers to create chatbots based on them, one of the people said. Google plans to launch the feature as a stand-alone product but has also discussed eventually integrating it into YouTube, this person said. YouTube leaders have said they want to harness generative AI advances to help creators, who frequently say they would like more ways to engage with fans. The Character.AI-like effort within Labs shows how Google is looking to capitalize on the entertainment value of generative AI, in addition to incorporating productivity shortcuts through the Gemini chatbot and features such as the ability to compose email drafts in its Workspace office software. Character.AI\u2019s early success last year was driven largely by users conversing with fictional or even surrealistic personas such as Homer Simpson or a talking block of Swiss cheese. Meta followed with chatbots modeled after celebrities and influencers such as Charli D\u2019Amelio, whose avatar, Coco, offers dancing tips. Meta is also testing a studio for enabling businesses and creators to make their own personalized chatbots, which could act as virtual proxies for time-strapped influencers. There are signs consumer appetite for these and other personalized chatbots has waned. The Meta chatbot played by Snoop Dogg, for instance, only has about 15,000 followers on Instagram, compared with 87.5 million on the rapper\u2019s actual account. It\u2019s also not clear how Google would make money from the bots. Character.AI has a $9.99 monthly subscription, which offers premium features like quicker messaging with its chatbots. Meta doesn\u2019t charge for its personalized chatbot, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors in April the company might place ads into or charge for premium AI assistants. Google and Character.AI have a complicated history. Two former Google engineers founded the startup in 2021 after Google dragged its feet on launching an AI chatbot they had developed internally. Character co-founder Noam Shazeer was one of the inventors of a type of machine-learning model at Google that paved the way for more advanced software, including OpenAI\u2019s GPT models. Character.AI and Google Cloud have since struck a partnership under which the startup uses Google\u2019s advanced AI chips, called tensor processing units. Shazeer didn\u2019t have a comment on Google\u2019s chatbot plans. Google Labs, an incubator for new AI products, helped develop other AI features that have become prominent additions to Google\u2019s products. Those include the AI Overviews feature in its search engine, which uses AI to automatically generate responses to complex queries, as well as VideoFX, a tool enabling users to create AI-generated videos. After testing AI Overviews for a year, Google announced in May that it would roll it out to all users globally. Kalley Huang contributed to this article.

        "publish_date": "Jun 24, 2024, 6:04pm PDT",
        "body_content": "Anduril has lined up backers for one of the biggest venture deals this year. The defense startup is close to finalizing a $1.5 billion investment co-led by Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, according to two people involved in the deal. Sands Capital, known for investments just before public offerings, is co-leading the deal as a new investor, according to one of those people. The investment will value the 7-year-old company at around $12.5 billion, or $14 billion including the new money, according to the people. Founders Fund, which has invested in every prior Anduril round, will invest $400 million as part of the new fundraising, said one of the people. The capital raise is unusually large given the moribund market for investments in mature companies outside those in artificial intelligence. It follows Anduril\u2019s revenue growth, which roughly doubled last year to about $500 million. Anduril represents one of Founders Fund\u2019s biggest bets, alongside Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. The VC firm helped start Anduril in 2017, when Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey and Founders Fund general partner Trae Stephens created the defense startup. Founders Fund led Anduril\u2019s seed and Series A and participated in four subsequent rounds, according to PitchBook. Investors valued Anduril in 2022 at $8.5 billion, including the investment. Sands Capital, an Arlington, Virginia-based investor in public stocks and private startups, has invested in Brazilian digital banking startup Nubank and marketing automation firm Klaviyo in late-stage rounds before their public offerings. Anduril, which makes rocket launchers, drones and high-tech weapons systems, has told investors it is aiming to hit $1 billion in annual revenue by 2026. Its strong revenue growth has encouraged other VC investors to embrace defense tech startups, which many had avoided because of concerns about the unpredictability of government contracts and agreements with limited partners that prevented them from investing in weaponry. Such growth comes at a cost. Anduril has told investors it expected to burn through $2 billion between 2021 to 2026. Its $12.5 billion price tag is 25 times last year\u2019s revenue, a much higher multiple than for incumbents like Lockheed Martin, which is valued at 1.6 times last year\u2019s sales in the public markets. With its new valuation, including the investment, Anduril joins a group of mature companies such as human resources startup Rippling and data-labeling startup Scale that have recently raised money at higher valuations than in their past rounds. That contrasts with a decline in valuations for late-stage startups since the peak in valuation during the pandemic. What\u2019s more, only a handful of other startups have raised at least $1 billion in individual rounds this year. They include cloud provider CoreWeave, chatbot developer Anthropic and cybersecurity firm Wiz. Other past Anduril investors include Valor Equity Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, 8VC, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thomas Tull\u2019s United States Innovative Technology Fund. It\u2019s not clear if these others are investing in the new round. Natasha Mascarenhas is a reporter at The Information, based in San Francisco, who covers venture capital and startups.

        "heading": "China\u2019s Didi Makes Its Pitch to U.S. Investors Ahead of Potential 2025 HK IPO",
        "author_name": "Jing Yang",
        "publish_date": "Jun 17, 2024, 6:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "Didi Global, the Chinese ride-hailing giant whose U.S. initial public offering in 2021 upset Chinese regulators so much the company delisted less than a year later, is coming out of its shell after two years of seclusion. Hoping to go public again in Hong Kong next year, Didi is telling investors that it is back in Beijing\u2019s good graces and its business performance has been improving. Didi representatives led by vice president and head of capital markets David Xu have been meeting U.S.-based investors extensively in the past several months, including at tech conferences hosted by Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan, and in meetings and calls organized by Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and other banks, according to investors and bankers with knowledge of Didi\u2019s activities. Didi has told investors that it had smoothed out the regulatory issues in China\u2014relating to compliance with cybersecurity rules and overseas share sales. Meanwhile, a person close to the China Securities Regulatory Commission said the agency would clear Didi\u2019s IPO when the company lodges its application. A return to the public market would be good news for SoftBank Group and Uber, two early investors which are each sitting on billions of dollars in paper losses on their stakes. SoftBank still holds a 20% stake in Didi, while Uber owns 12%, according to Didi securities filings. The company is also holding several billion dollars in cash and investments, mostly money it raised in the U.S. IPO. In a bid to boost confidence, Didi in November announced a $1 billion share buyback program over the next two years. Investor interest in the ride-hailing industry may also be stronger now, as U.S. ride hailing firms Uber and Lyft have turned the corner financially. Uber is generating hundreds of millions in cash annually and its stock price is now well above its IPO price after many years of trading below it. At the same time, however, relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated, hurting U.S. investment in Chinese firms. Allowing a high-profile company like Didi to list again could buttress global investor sentiment on China, after the tumultuous tech regulation reset sparked debates whether China is still investible. So far, Chinese regulators have been cautious at approving overseas listings under the new guidelines that took effect since early last year. While applications do get granted, the process has been slow and the outcome far from certain. The company hasn\u2019t officially hired any banks for the Hong Kong IPO yet, and is hoping to post a few more quarters of profits, including curbing losses from its overseas business, before moving to the next phase of IPO preparations, which is interviewing bankers, investors and bankers say. Bloomberg earlier reported on Didi\u2019s plans to go public in Hong Kong this year. Didi said in a statement that it has been \u201cmaintaining regular communication with investors to keep them updated on business progress,\u201d and that \u201cthere is no timetable at present\u201d for the Hong Kong IPO. \u201cDidi is currently focused on continuously developing our core business, better serving riders, drivers and partners, and constantly improving product services and innovation capabilities to create long-term value for the industry and society,\u201d the statement added. Off the Radar Didi\u2019s New York IPO occurred in June 2021, when the company raised $4.4 billion. But Didi had gone public without getting the blessing from regulatory agencies back home, reflecting ambiguity in rules on overseas IPOs. Three days after the IPO, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s cybersecurity watchdog, launched a whirlwind investigation into the company over national security grounds and pulled its apps from local app stores. Prompted by Didi\u2019s defiance, China also announced new rules governing the overseas listing of Chinese companies. Didi stock plunged 20% within days. Six months later, Didi said it would delist from the NYSE and pursue a listing in Hong Kong in the future. After a shareholder vote in May 2022, Didi\u2019s American depositary shares ceased trading on the exchange. By that point, the stock had dropped to $2 from its IPO price of $14. Even so, Didi shares have continued to trade on the \u201cover-the-counter\u201d market\u2014typically for companies that aren\u2019t eligible to list on major exchanges\u2014rallying as high as $5 in recent weeks, giving it a value of about $20 billion.  Didi has since dropped off the radar of many U.S. investors. Shortly after the delisting, China\u2019s cybersecurity regulator concluded its investigation into Didi. The company ended up paying a $1.2 billion fine for violations of cybersecurity, data security and personal information protection rules. It also overhauled its operations to bring them into compliance with local data security rules. In January last year, its apps were restored to app stores, allowing the company to add new users again. Didi also streamlined its businesses, selling the loss-making electric vehicle unit to XPeng for $744 million in exchange for a 5% stake in the Chinese EV maker in August last year. But even as Didi gradually sorted through its various issues, it avoided communications with U.S. investors, declining requests for updates, investors say. That changed earlier this year, when Didi began offering to meet with U.S.-based hedge funds and mutual funds alike in both one-on-one and group settings. Company executives were taken to visit investors in the San Francisco Bay Area during Morgan Stanley\u2019s Technology, Media and Telecom conference in March, and sat down with investors in New York in April in meetings arranged by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, according to investors who met with Didi. In late May, company executives also showed up to one-on-one investor meetings during J.P. Morgan\u2019s Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference in Boston, according to the conference agenda seen by The Information. Earlier this month, Jefferies analysts hosted an investor call with Didi, hailing the company\u2019s growth potential, according to a note from the call seen by The Information. Better Story In many ways, Didi has a better story to tell now. Its domestic mobility market share has recovered to around 75%, the level before the crackdown, according to investors. It has been a strong challenger to Uber in Latin America, according to a report by Measurable AI, a digital economy consultancy focused on emerging markets. However, Didi representatives told investors in recent meetings that the company intends to limit its market share in China to no more than 80% to preempt potential anti-trust and other regulatory scrutiny. Didi turned profitable in the third and fourth quarters last year, and would have been profitable in the first three months this year too if excluding a one-time mark-to-market loss in its investment in XPeng. (XPeng\u2019s share price fell 45% in the first quarter.) Revenue rose 36% last year over 2022. Investors might find Didi appealing if the IPO occurs: its revenue is almost three quarters of Uber\u2019s, but its market capitalization, based on its over-the-counter trading, stands around $20 billion. Uber, in contrast, has a market capitalization of roughly $150 billion. Qianer Liu contributed to this article. Jing Yang is the Asia Bureau Chief at The Information.

        "publish_date": "Jun 14, 2024, 11:40am PDT",
        "body_content": "\u201cCan we stay on strawberries for a minute?\u201d Vinod Khosla asked me. About halfway into our hour-long conversation with Vinod Khosla on \u201cMore or Less\u201d this week, we found ourselves deep in the topic of artificial intelligence\u2013generated strawberries. (I wanted to talk about media owners protecting their intellectual property, but alas, no one was game!) It became a case study in one of the biggest debates we have on this podcast, and across Silicon Valley right now: which companies will make money from AI. We got to this topic via a very wide-ranging conversation about where and how to invest in AI, Apple\u2019s big news this week, OpenAI, Google, Trump, Biden, tech regulation and more. Through it all, I think we also captured a personal side to this investor that I think few have seen, from his AI-generated garden to what\u2019s in his ChatGPT history. Arguably few know where AI is\u2014and is going\u2014better. From Khosla\u2019s early investment in OpenAI to its investments in new companies like Cognition Labs and Replika, few AI investors have been more prolific than Khosla. And what I enjoyed most about our conversation was his views on where it is heading. Cost of compute? Startups shouldn\u2019t worry. Seed rounds pricey? Eighty percent of his are under $25 million valuations. Transformer models? He thinks there is much more to come. Impact on society? Too early to tell. I hope you all enjoy this episode as much as we did. A full transcript follows. Apple Spotify\n\nYouTube Jessica Lessin: Welcome, friends to another week of \u201cMore or Less.\u201d And we have a very special guest. So without further ado, let\u2019s welcome Vinod Khosla to the pod. Thanks so much for joining us. Vinod Khosla: Great to be here. Dave Morin: Good to have you, Vinod. Brit Morin: We are down in Texas visiting some family and working remotely this week. So if you can see my background in the YouTube video, I don\u2019t usually have this much wood, but I like it. I\u2019m here for it. This is a Texas style. Dave: We are literally cooking\u2014it\u2019s 105 degrees here, so. Jessica: But Dave, you\u2019re wearing a sweatshirt, so I\u2019m confused. Brit: This is Dave\u2019s problem. He\u2019s from Montana. Dave: I\u2019m always cold. Jessica: Well, guys, what a week. I mean, I feel like every week in the Valley is AI week. And some weeks we try to steer clear of it for variety. But I think with the big Apple announcement that we have all been kind of waiting for, the unveiling of Apple Intelligence, that\u2019s a great place to start this week. And of course, a big part of that was Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI, which Vinod was the first venture capital investor in way back when. So I\u2019ve got to ask Vinod, what did you make of all the news out of Apple? Vinod: First, I haven\u2019t caught up with all the news that was reserved for the weekend, but Apple needed to do something. Siri was starting to go from a reputation to worse, if that was possible. But more importantly, they\u2019ve demonstrated something that\u2019s really important. Computers interface with you directly. You don\u2019t have to futz around to get stuff from computers. Computers get you stuff. And I\u2019d done a blog post on this topic a couple of months ago in The Information, this idea that computers will learn humans instead of humans needing to learn computers. And I think we\u2019re seeing the beginnings of that. That was exciting, obviously, from an OpenAI perspective. It clearly establishes where OpenAI is in the competition for the best [large-language models]. Obviously, many people wanted that business, and many things were evaluated. And so it\u2019s really rewarding to see where Apple thinks the best AI is. And I\u2019m sure they considered where the best AI will be a year or two from now. So in many ways, [it\u2019s] validation for OpenAI and a really big milestone in how humans interface with machines. Jessica: I think [Apple] did say Gemini is coming as well. And we think they might do something with Anthropic. So not to diminish OpenAI having a great model, but I bring it up only that it raises a question I\u2019m wondering about, which is kind of if Apple\u2019s trying to recreate an app store, if you will, with this intelligence. And if the goal is to be partnering broadly and routing to different services in the way that I remember when they first launched Siri, they said they were going to send you to OpenTable for reservations or, you know, so on and so forth. So do you have any insight into where you think Apple is going with the technology, or even, I guess more broadly, this idea of how apps and services are going to be discovered? Vinod: I think first on the comment, it\u2019d be smart of Apple to keep its options open, be able to go to any LLM. But they did make a choice in what gets embedded and built into the OS enough for Elon Musk to get all upset about banning Apple devices. So they did make some pretty explicit choices and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll keep the options open.\u201d I presume I\u2019m just going by your reporting. So I feel pretty good about that. But I do think the bigger thing is, how do we interface with computers? And Siri is the beginning of what will evolve over time into a genetic. Sam Lessin: I think in passing we have talked about the future of big models versus small models, right? And one of the interesting things I think from what you\u2019re seeing with Apple is the idea that they can do a lot on [devices], right? And there can be a lot done with a small model. And then what is the place of big models that are incredibly expensive, right? To an incredibly competitive long term, do they just become content? You know, and what is the positioning there? So I\u2019m kind of curious, I know you haven\u2019t fully caught up yet, how you think about this. Vinod: Well, I think what on-device small models do will be different than what the large models do. If you want human-level intelligence from a model, it\u2019ll be a big model and there\u2019ll be a couple of them around, some better than others, some a year or two ahead of others. But I don\u2019t think small models substitute for big models, but they do some things really well. If you\u2019re talking to something with very low latency, you want a shorter path, so that\u2019d be a small model on device. In fact, I think Intel, even with its Meteor Lake new processors, bundling a small LLM with it. But they\u2019re meant to do responsive interfacing, not to be the source of intelligence. Sam: But just to push you, and then\u2026we have a lot of ground to cover. Imagine a future where you have a lot of people you can talk to. Some have IQ 50, some have IQ 100, some have IQ 10,000, right? And the question is, where do you want to spend the money to ask the IQ 10,000 person a question versus asking the person who might have an IQ of 70 but knows what\u2019s in your email? Right? And kind of, what the balance [is] of where questions get asked and where processing goes. So I guess my question is\u2026right now, I feel like we\u2019re basically\u2014and this is partially the cost of the models and the cost of you can compute for them\u2014we\u2019re asking every question we can come up with to a really, really expensive PhD, right? And in the future, I think we\u2019ll be a lot smarter about what level of intelligence we need for different questions. How do you see that competitively playing out? Vinod: I might disagree. I think what will happen is the expense of compute will become dirt cheap. My bet is a year from now, it will cost one-fifth to one-tenth of what it does today. And my advice to all our startups is ignore the cost of compute. Because any dollar you spend on optimizing your software will be worthless within the year. And so forget about it\u2014rely on competition in the marketplace between cloud and Gemini and OpenAI to reduce that cost to a point where it doesn\u2019t matter. And\u2026below a certain level, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re paying a certain amount for your iPhone service monthly; if it\u2019s 10% or less of that, it doesn\u2019t matter. And that\u2019s where I\u2026 Jessica: Why do you think\u2026companies should ignore the cost and it\u2019s going to drop so precipitously? What are you seeing? Vinod: Because every large model owner is trying to drive it down. And they can. Sam: Well, but Vinod, isn\u2019t each large model successively coming out costing, like, an order of magnitude more to train? Vinod: It is costing an order of magnitude more to train. And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t think open-source models will be viable because of the training costs. But once you\u2019re trained, you want as broad a set of usage [as possible] for two reasons. One, you want the most revenue from it, and the lowest-cost models will get the most revenue. But more importantly, there\u2019s huge data generation for training the next generation of the model. So for lots of reasons, you want to maximize usage. And if you\u2019re playing the long game\u2014and I think the AI model game is mostly being played sort of on a five-year time horizon, not a one-year time horizon\u2014in that time horizon, costs will drop. Yet today, Nvidia extracts a fairly good tax from everybody. But every model is going to run on multiple types of [graphics processing units] or compute. And they will want the most data generation. So I\u2019m pretty convinced the next few years, the revenue isn\u2019t the important metric. You don\u2019t want to, of course, lose so much money if you can\u2019t afford it, but you\u2019re not trying to make tons of money. You\u2019re trying to get tons of usage. And you\u2019re trying to get tons of data from the usage and learn to be a better model. I do think there\u2019s a lot to be gained in intelligence, whether it\u2019s reasoning, whether it\u2019s probabilistic thinking, whether it\u2019s sort of pattern matching, any of these things. And these models have lots of headroom to get better. And I think we\u2019ll see stunning advances practically every year. You know, so much of this has been rumored. Some firms are executing better than others. I think that\u2019s the principal difference. I think OpenAI has been very good in execution, but Google has great technology and technologies. They just haven\u2019t been as crisp about their execution. Jessica: I\u2019ll just add on the revenue point\u2014I love when there\u2019s breaking news during the pod taping. But the information just reported that OpenAI\u2019s revenues on an annualized basis have doubled year over year. Vinod: I\u2019m not going to comment because I just got an update last night. Jessica: So revenue may not be what you\u2019re advising them to focus on, but we shouldn\u2019t ignore [it]. They seem to be doing an OK job. But over to you, Brit and Dave: What\u2019s top of mind for you on this topic? Brit: Well, I can pick up from there. I\u2019m curious, Vinod, when you\u2019re thinking about that five-year time horizon, you know, there are some of us, I won\u2019t name names, who believe that AI is really going to all go into the incumbents, and even then it\u2019s commoditized. What do you see as sort of the five-year outlook, and where are the themes that you\u2019re paying closer attention to where it doesn\u2019t roll into the incumbents? Vinod: So I don\u2019t believe that. If you\u2019re building foundation models and trying to compete with OpenAI and Google, that\u2019s not a great place. Large LLMs will belong to the large players. Brit: And is that the right timing to be thinking about? Vinod: Players who can train on very large clusters, people who can pay for proprietary content, whether it\u2019s with Reddit or somebody else, somebody who can access every scientific article, which is usually sitting in stringer nature or some publication like that. So large players do have an advantage if you\u2019re continuing the past. Recently we announced we\u2019re investing in Symbolica, [which focused on] symbolic logic. Very, very different approach. It doesn\u2019t depend on gobs of data. It doesn\u2019t depend on gobs of compute. Completely orthogonal axis, high risk, high upside. If it works, it\u2019s dramatic. So there are, even at the model layer, orthogonal approaches to do. If I called my friend Josh Tenenbaum at MIT, he\u2019d say the big contribution is going to be probabilistic programming. Humans think probabilistically; it\u2019s different than pattern matching. That\u2019s a major element. So I don\u2019t think we are anywhere near done with fundamental techniques. We are exploiting the transformer model more and more, but there are other models to be done. Everybody\u2019s scared to invest in anything other than transformer models. We\u2019re not. I\u2019m very focused on, you know, esoteric things. In fact, Symbolica is some esoteric math called category theory, which most mathematicians haven\u2019t heard of. So it was a pretty big bet we placed probably 15, 18 months ago. I think it\u2019s silly to invest in the cloud, people who are buying GPUs to build clouds. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to lose to Amazon and its scale and efficiency. Yeah, they are all doing custom chips, so they don\u2019t have to pay the Nvidia tax. Over a couple of years, they\u2019re all getting AMD. Sam: Because they\u2019re gonna lose to Amazon. Vinod: At the next level up, the applications, there\u2019s huge opportunity. One of my big forecasts is [that] almost all expertise will be free. So whether you\u2019re talking about a primary care doctor, a teacher, a structural engineer, an oncologist, there are so many areas of expertise, hundreds if not thousands, each will be a very successful venture. We recently invested in building a structural engineer. Of course, we invest in something like Devin that\u2019s very popular. Everybody knows about it. They\u2019re building an AI programmer. They\u2019re not building tools for programmers like Copilot. They\u2019re building a programmer. But we just invest in building a structural engineer. But how many structural engineers are there and how much do we spend on structural engineering? And you take a building structure and give it to a structural engineer, you get something back in two months and you get one variation. You can get five variations within five hours from an AI structural engineer and save yourselves multiple months on a construction project. That\u2019s a great example of a niche that could be a multi tens of billion dollars niche. Sam: Can I push you on that, though? Because I get, I believe what you\u2019re saying, and I agree that if you could actually write down everything that a structural engineer does, all of a sudden it becomes very possible to create a synthetic structural engineer that\u2019s faster and better. Here\u2019s my question to you: Is that actually a defensible business or can anyone access these models because they\u2019re a commodity? Vinod: So my view is all of these will have reliance on some LLMs and specific things related to the domain. The workflow for a structural engineer and how they interact with, say, a design AI engineer that\u2019s running its own AutoCAD are different, and how they interact between the end client and the architect, and the architect will be an AI architect eventually. But this idea that it\u2019ll be one model and does everything is not right. Workflow is different in every area. The nuances\u2014which libraries you import in from AutoCAD, or which catalog do you use to say which steel beams are available, what\u2019s the pricing of that, and how do you compose a structure that\u2019s low cost. So there will be domain-specific specialization in all those areas. An oncologist won\u2019t just take GPT-6 and be an oncologist. There\u2019ll be a lot of specifics. If you\u2019re an AI oncologist, you know there\u2019s tests that can say after 20 different chemotherapy drugs, this one will affect your cancer the most. It\u2019s not done today because it\u2019s too expensive. And most oncologists don\u2019t have the breadth of knowledge. But just this week, somebody called me, they had a cancer thing and they wanted to say which chemotherapy drug they should take. Now, I\u2019m not a chemotherapy expert, but I referred them to one of our companies that run the test and test all 20 drugs against one of your tumor samples. And we can predict with incredible accuracy which drug will be most effective before you go through the whole chemotherapy regimen. Hugely valuable. Sam: I guess the question is, where\u2019s the edge, right? There clearly is [an] edge somewhere, but if the answer is at the extremes, I would go so far as to say that there probably won\u2019t be a great market in a general, you know, family doctor as a potential application, because the reality is it\u2019s too easy to write down all the things that a general physician knows and then too easy to process. So even though you might have an ER doctor who\u2019s a general physician that\u2019s digital, it\u2019s going to be a very hard market to win as a business in, right? Whereas the specialties may be different, right? Vinod: I disagree, actually. I think the specialties will become embedded in the generic. And the general, like primary care and mental health therapy, are two examples that I think will be larger businesses because there\u2019s other aspects than just the knowledge aspect. Jessica: Dave, what\u2019s on your mind with all of this? I know you\u2019re closely looking at startups in the space and I want to hear your headlines on Apple, too. I think you were one of the first people on this pod to bring up watching what they\u2019re doing by integrating chips with small language models. And I feel like a lot of the features we saw embedded into Apple Mail and so forth were kind of in your crystal ball. Dave: I\u2019ve been saying for a while that I think that Apple will be the one to bring the small models to market in a way that makes it very real for consumers and developers. And I guess one of the headlines that I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about is that Apple kind of, or not kind of, they really showed that they have the trifecta down there of the ability to build technology, the ability to build platforms and the ability to build products all at once. Most of the big tech companies can only do two of the three or one of the three. And so I think it\u2019s impressive that, you know, they\u2019re really bringing the full breadth of their real technology capabilities to bear here. And they\u2019re not just doing it in a way that is just talking about the technology, which is a lot [of] what we\u2019ve seen over the last year. And they\u2019re also not just doing it by bringing great things to consumers, though they did that. I think what\u2019s most impressive is the amount of developer tools and platforms that they dropped on the market yesterday. And there\u2019s a lot of esoteric things there, but I think developers and entrepreneurs are quite excited to have a bunch of new tools with very direct impact on some of these vertical businesses like Vinod\u2019s talking about, and a bunch of new goodies to do great new work. And at the same time, the one thing that I was disappointed about is that you cannot access these local models directly. It\u2019s something that a lot of folks aren\u2019t talking about. They\u2019ve put a pretty intense wrapper around it, at least on the developer front. You can use their Swift programming language and a bunch of components that show up in the [user interface] and manifest these models into your applications. But to access the models directly as a developer, that\u2019s not something you can do yet. And so I think that actually is something that there isn\u2019t a whole lot of nuance in the coverage around right now, because as a developer, like you guys are saying, you\u2019re either going to choose to go to open AI, pay the tax to use that API. Or I think what a lot of developers thought was going to happen with this launch was that they were going to get to use these local models for, you know, highly specific use cases for free. And it doesn\u2019t appear that that\u2019s true yet today. And so I think that\u2019s, like, a very interesting nuance about what was announced yesterday that not a whole lot of people are covering. But I don\u2019t know, other than that, I guess those are some initial thoughts on at least the Apple side of things. Jessica: By the way, I like how civil we\u2019re being, we\u2019re never this civil on the pod. Sam: Vinod has a calming effect on us, but\u2026don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m gonna amp it up. So here\u2019s my amp it up question. You might\u2019ve guessed, or maybe not, when Brit was referring to the AI skeptic as an investor, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m a huge believer that the big companies are going to make an incredible amount of money on this technology. But I think what you are seeing in the investment market is what I call a bunch of what I\u2019ll call not real venture capitalists, but asset managers plowing money into AI because it\u2019s easy to plow money into AI. And then you\u2019re seeing\u2014and I give you a lot of credit for this, Vinod, because\u2026I consider you a real venture capitalist and I know you actually deploy a lot of your own money, right? Unlike a lot of these other firms\u2026you actually care about returns because it\u2019s actually your money as opposed to other people\u2019s money. Only real capitalists. Vinod: By the way, since I started the firm 20 years ago, I\u2019ve never taken a dollar in fees. Dave: Only real venture capitalists on the \u201cMore or Less\u201d pod. Sam: I have a lot of respect is you\u2019re a DPI guy, not an AUM guy, and like, but you actually invest across the spectrum, right? And my kind of thing has been at the extreme of the seed investing. I think most seed investors getting into AI are playing a fool\u2019s errand, right? Because it\u2019s not a place where one to $3 million really can move the needle in terms of value, right? In terms of what the game is. So to me\u2026it\u2019s clearly a place the big guys win. You can argue about the middle, maybe, and I\u2019d love to hear what\u2014I mean, you obviously have a different opinion than me there. And then at the seed, it\u2019s a disaster, right? From a VC perspective. I\u2019m curious if you, like, I assume you think I\u2019m wrong, but I\u2019d be curious what your take is. Vinod: Well, let me give you some very specific examples. I was pretty excited earlier in the podcast about Symbolica. They came with a ridiculous set of claims in January or February of 2023. And I said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll give you a $2 million seed. And if you prove this out, then we can talk more.\u201d They came back in March of this year, not very long ago, and said, \u201cHere\u2019s the results that I promised.\u201d I said, \u201cDon\u2019t go out. I\u2019ll write you a $15 million check tomorrow,\u201d which we did. So we just went ahead and did the financing. We didn\u2019t wait for outside pricing. We didn\u2019t wait for others to weigh in. I didn\u2019t care about anybody else\u2019s opinion. We bet on it. So that\u2019s sort of the large small seed turning into a larger investment into something larger. By the way, we have a lot of robotic seed still. The real tiny ones that\u2019ll grow, but take Hedral, the structural engineer I was talking about. It\u2019s a seed. It\u2019s never gonna take 50 million or a hundred million. It\u2019s gonna be a seed that grows into a profitable business if that works. Sam: Fair enough. Vinod: So I do think there\u2019s room for seed, but following what everybody else is doing is a bad strategy. Anytime somebody leaves DeepMind, give them $2 million, that\u2019s a bad strategy. Sam: Yes. Dave: We aggressively agree on that point. Sam: On this we agree. Brit: Finally, we got one. We got one, Sam. Vinod: We spend an incredible amount of time thinking about which business plan will be railroaded by GPT-5, GPT-6, Sora 2, Sora 3. And we have pretty good access. We\u2019re reasonably good at predicting what will be railroaded and what won\u2019t be, and what will be good partnerships. Sam: So then to push a step further with your point, though, about\u2026in your seed practice, right? Where in theory, at least abstractly, if not practically, we\u2019re all investors and all mildly competitive in the seed practice. How do you think about pricing discipline? \u2019Cause from my perspective, one of the reasons why seed is so bad in AI is because that person spinning out a DeepMind raising their seed, not only are they probably gonna fail, but it\u2019s gonna be so ridiculously overpriced that there\u2019s no way to ever make money on it. And so\u2026from an investor mindset perspective, where do you get that edge to find the reasonably priced AI seeds? Vinod: So I think one has to spend a lot of time thinking about first, what will be railroaded by the big models? What will become a feature in those models and get obsolete? And we debate that a lot. We have a lot of internal technical expertise in those areas and good contacts. So, but I would guess that 80% of the investments we\u2019ve made in seed are below 25 million posts. And occasionally we\u2019ll step up to something like Devin with zero revenue and say, \u201cWe have a certain belief system and we\u2019ll pony up.\u201d I\u2019d say 80% or 90% of the billion-dollar valuations, maybe more, we pass on. But there is 10% or 20% that we will do. We did do Replit. We did do Devin. We\u2019ll occasionally look at high valuations. And then sometimes we\u2019ll invest just for relationship purposes, in which case we\u2019ll make a small token investment. Sam: Yeah. Well, that was going to be my question on the kind of high valuations is, are you doing it as an investor? Are you doing it in an ecosystem perspective? Because that I understand, right. Vinod: So Devin and Replit were definitely investments. We\u2019ve done others that are ecosystem and relationship investment. We know somebody really well, the valuation got out of hand, we do a token amount and that\u2019s OK. And we do a fair amount of that too. Sam: Fair enough. Jessica: Are valuations getting more out of hand or less out of hand? Vinod: If I look at the last three months, I think they\u2019re starting to stabilize. They haven\u2019t started getting to rational, but we are pretty picky. So, you know, I look at what percentage of our applicable investments are below $25 million pre- or post. And it\u2019s [a] fairly large percentage, but we are bringing something to the party. So when a structural engineering startup comes or a music startup comes, we\u2019ll add a lot to the thinking and help evolve the plan. So that\u2019s why I say I\u2019m not in the investing business, I\u2019m in the venture assistance business. Brit: Vinod, I was just going to ask, how are you using AI in your everyday life and within Khosla? And do you see the future of the sort of AI machine-learning\u2013enabled venture firm existing? Vinod: You know, so obviously the most obvious thing, the biggest uses is ChatGPT for me and my Full Self Driving on my Tesla. It\u2019s amazing the number of times I just say go and let it drive. It is like totally, you know, the other night I landed at 3 a.m. Dave: It really is amazing. Vinod: I was, like, I\u2019m too tired. I\u2019m not going to be a safe driver. I just said, \u201cTake me home.\u201d And that was wonderful. So those are major uses and both those many, many times a day, typically. Sam: What do you do at ChatGPT daily? I\u2019m curious. Vinod: I can go to my ChatGPT and tell you what my last. Brit: Yeah, this is good. I want to know. Give us your last three prompts. Jessica: This is great. This is a new segment. Sam: This is better than\u2014have you seen on social media they sometimes do the what\u2019s on your discover page? This is even worse, which is what\u2019s in your ChatGPT window. This should be a new question we ask every Fifth Wheel on \u201cMore or Less,\u201d your last three prompts. Vinod: So just this morning I heard that, you know, the Coney Island hot-dog\u2013eating contest that Nathan\u2019s banned Joey Chestnut from competing because he keeps winning every time. And so\u2026Joey\u2019s been talking to one of our companies, Impossible Foods, that just introduced a hot dog. I immediately went and said, \u201cWho\u2019s the creative agency for people we could partner with?\u201d Sam: There\u2019s a value-add investor. Vinod: I said, \u201cLet\u2019s hold our own contest.\u201d This is sort of not even there. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll do it.\u2026And I was talking to the CEO and I said, \u201cWho can we do it with?\u201d I said, \u201cYou know, Athletic Brewing company is the fastest-growing non, right?\u201d And\u2026so I pulled up\u2026 Jessica: We love Athletic Brewing. Love it. Sam: Yeah, we\u2019re long Athletic Brewing\u2026 Brit: Yeah, we\u2019re big fans. Dave: That\u2019s all you can drink at Sam and Jess\u2019s house. Jessica: That\u2019s the only thing we provide. Vinod: \u2026their agency. And that was, like, to me a big deal to find immediately while I\u2019m talking to the CEO what that is. So that was one. Sam: That\u2019s classic Vinod because it\u2019s a classic hot dog, not [a] hot dog use case for AI. Jessica: Programmer joke. Sam: There you go. Hot dog versus but does it know the Impossible? Does it know the Impossible Hot Dog? Is that a hot dog or not a hot dog? It\u2019s, like, [a] very deep meta question of AI. Dave: But back to Vinod\u2019s ChatGPT; we want to know what he\u2019s using it for. Vinod: So Sunday I was watching the cricket match with my son, the India-Pakistan cricket match, big deal in India. My family was watching it in India. We were conversing, and ChatGPT helped me say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the right run rate in the first six or eight innings or over of the cricket match?\u201d I had probably 10 queries related to cricket because I don\u2019t watch it every day. And that was really valuable. I probably had 10 or 15 queries with ChatGPT. So\u2026 Sam: That\u2019s really funny because you\u2019ve got Vinod who\u2019s legitimately, you know, probably one of the premier AI investors and his queries are about hot dogs and cricket. And, you know, I\u2019m, like, probably the ultimate skeptic on this stuff. And I\u2026have to admit that I actually very successfully used ChatGPT for, to basically in one shot, write me scripts in the last 24 hours to pull out all of the emails out of my entire Google dump of my calendar, and an entire dump of my email, of my entire inbox. So I\u2019m the one running technical queries here to work despite my\u2026 Vinod: I was also planning my spring garden, and I said, I want plants that grow in Zone 9A. I want the height of each plant because I was layering them. I want some to flower in the spring, some in early summer, some late summer, some in the fall. Literally, I had it lay out 20 plants and give me all this information, watering zone, climate zone, height, shade, no shade. It just laid out a table for me. ChatGPT did stunningly [what] would have taken me three or four hours. Sam: So do you believe then that the garden, the exterior garden designer as a job, is that a vertical market you would invest in or is that going to get taken by the general model? Vinod: Well, I do all my garden designing myself. I don\u2019t hire a designer. So for me, I\u2019ve taken them out already, and ChatGPT saved me a lot of time. Sam: No, fair enough. So anyone who\u2019s thinking of anyone listening\u2026the N of zero of people who are professional gardeners who listen to our podcast, beware. Brit: Shout-out to Dave. He had this use case like a year ago, and we laid out our whole garden the exact same way. So I wonder how many people are, yeah, just Sam, you\u2019re way off on what you\u2019re using GPT for. Jessica: Hey guys, we grew a strawberry over in Hillsborough and we\u2019re declaring that a victory. The deer didn\u2019t eat it. I\u2019m retiring. Sam: We talk about organic farming. We grew a strawberry, but we\u2019re having someone FedEx it to us. That was our solution for eating the strawberry. Jessica: That\u2019s not true. We\u2019re going to drive it in a car. OK. Brit: All right, all right, all right. Let\u2019s pass it back to Dave. Dave: I was just saying that I had the same thing where I was trying to lay out our front garden like a Japanese zen garden. I wanted different colors to change every month of the year and it nailed it. It\u2019s amazing. Vinod: I\u2019ve designed colors by month, by height of plant, so I can layer them, by amount of watering, by shade or no shade. It\u2019s just totally amazing. I guarantee you my garden is flowering like you wouldn\u2019t believe right now. Brit: Photo to prove this is true. Jessica: I\u2019m sure this is doable, but I want to pivot from strawberries to IP for a second\u2026 Vinod: Can I stay on strawberries for just a second? We are using AI to professionally grow strawberries, and we grow this special variety of Korean strawberries that sell for, like, five times the price of regular. OK. We have a greenhouse that\u2019s fully automated, including picking the strawberries, which would be hard to do by hand. Sam: Stay on strawberries. Vinod: And they sell at, like, five times the price in every New York restaurant. Prices them at, like, five bucks a strawberry or something. But there are these special incredible varieties hand tailored with our AI and robotics. No humans in this greenhouse. Brit: OK, I love this. Sam: But where\u2019s the edge in this in the 10 years? I get why you can do this for now, but in 10 years, aren\u2019t these strawberries gonna be a commodity? Brit: Everything\u2019s [a] commodity in Sam\u2019s world. Sam: Isn\u2019t the price on high-end strawberries gonna collapse because of robotics plus AI? Where\u2019s the edge? Vinod: Right. Brit: Venture is over and everything\u2019s commodity and the incumbents win. That\u2019s Sam\u2019s thesis. Sam: Isn\u2019t this, won\u2019t Monsanto be growing these strawberries in five years? Vinod: No, because they can\u2019t keep up. Sam: Ha ha ha! Jessica: I remember reading in The Information Weekend a story on this. And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy are we writing about robot-powered strawberry farms?\u201d But I guess this is a thing. So I\u2019m glad to know we\u2019re on trend. But I do want to keep us going because we have one more topic after this, AI. But obviously there\u2019s been a lot of attention played to the large language and foundation models striking deals with content owners. I think less so training, more [retrieval-augmented generation] and more incorporating information. Have these models behaved sort of lawfully to date as they have been building themselves? And what does the business model for not just content owners\u2014like, but you\u2019re talking about doctors and expertise\u2014but for creators of that expertise? Vinod: Look, I had this conversation, I did another podcast for The Wall Street Journal this morning, and the whole discussion topic was, \u201cIs AI going to be hugely deflationary?\u201d which I have said. It is going to be hugely deflationary in that what we are talking about is a lot of things approaching zero in cost because the labor content is out in all these things. Sam: Of course it is. Vinod: Maybe there\u2019s still a bit of land rent left and capex left, but it will be a hugely deflationary economy. If you take a million doctors and reduce them to just 200,000 and 80% has gone, then you\u2019re talking about $250 billion less spent on healthcare. That\u2019s deflationary. So if most of the content is AI generated, most of the music is AI generated, it\u2019s all deflationary, even though consumption will go up a lot in many of these areas. It\u2019s very hard to predict what the model does. So I think it\u2019s very unpredictable where we will go on these fronts. Jessica: So content business beware is sort of what I\u2019m hearing. Sam: Well, but no, here\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been playing with in my head, which is rather than paying all of these rights holders, quote unquote, why wouldn\u2019t someone just hire, like, 10,000 smart people to just talk to the AI all day long? Like, it seems like a more efficient\u2014or even a thousand, to hire like a thousand smart people and say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to license shit from anyone. I\u2019m just going to, like, basically\u2026every day I\u2019m going to pay a thousand people full-time salaries.\u201d Dave: Isn\u2019t that just Meta? And they don\u2019t even have to pay people; people just give it to them for free. Sam: Well, indirectly, well, that\u2019s obviously\u2014the content pump that is Meta has always been a really interesting one. I mean, I do believe that, like, there\u2019s the problem is\u2026you know, all these things are a reflection of their interface. The medium is the message. So I\u2019m just saying, like, why wouldn\u2019t you? Dave: Or maybe more accurately YouTube, Sam. Like, YouTube is this. Vinod: So Sam, the thing to keep in mind is in this deflationary economy where there\u2019s plenty of everything, what is valuable? Sam: Directionally, but I just feel like if you told me there are a thousand people that were paid every day to talk to an LLM for six hours a day about what\u2019s going on, what they\u2019ve learned, almost like an Oracle style, you know\u2026 Vinod: I don\u2019t think Taylor Swift is about music. It\u2019s about a phenomena and an experience for 15-year-old girls. It\u2019s a phenomena. It\u2019s an experience. Sam: It\u2019s a cult. It\u2019s a cult. Jessica: [It\u2019s] 41-year-old girls, but yeah. Yeah, you\u2019ve got some Swifties here, but yeah. Brit: Or 38-year-old girls, but yeah, keep going. Yeah. Vinod: I do think the nature of human experience will value things differently. Why have we gone from really well-manufactured great goods and paid three times as much or something that\u2019s handcrafted and poorly done? Because it\u2019s human experience we value and different people value different things. So how all this gets reorganized into a set of values? Very hard to predict. I\u2019m sort of saying the only thing we can say is it\u2019ll change dramatically. I don\u2019t think we can say how it will change. Sam: Vinod, you\u2019re pitching my creator fund where we invest in people and cults rather than technology as kind of the tip of the spear for the future of the economy. So I get it. I\u2019m with you. It\u2019ll be interesting. Jessica: The other thing that\u2019s been consuming the Valley at the moment is obviously we have the presidential election, and you\u2019ve been very outspoken with your views of what\u2019s at stake. And I think you were maybe falsely accused of calling the hosts of the \u201cAll In\u201d pod MAGA Trump extremists\u2026 Vinod: Look, there\u2019s been a constituency in Silicon Valley, sort of Peter Thiel and his cohorts. Jessica: Why are we seeing very prominent figures in Silicon Valley pivot hard for Trump? The Valley fundraiser that was hosted raised $14 million, Fox News reported, so\u2026 [Correction: It was $12 million.] Vinod: And I\u2019m not going to call them MAGA extremists. My test for a MAGA extremist is, do they believe the election was stolen and January 6 was justified? You can have a different libertarian view and not be a MAGA extremist. I think Peter Thiel and David Sacks and all sort of belong to this less regulation, leave people alone [school]. Every person gets rewarded according to their capabilities. But it\u2019s a small group of people in that cohort able to write large checks. But I think that\u2019s really different than MAGA extremists who\u2014you know, if the test for a [vice president] is, \u201cDo you believe the election was stolen?\u201d that\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs in this country. Biden is not a perfect candidate, but the question I ask people is, \u201cDo you want to have your kids have the values that Trump has?\u201d If the answer is yes, that\u2019s a different question. Not in a million years would I want my kids to have that value, whether he\u2019s talking denigrating women or immigrants or whoever disagrees with him and makes up facts and is willing to say, as a presidential candidate, I never said lock her up. Like, there\u2019s hundreds of examples. That\u2019s very different than saying, \u201cI want less regulation\u201d or \u201cI want lower taxes.\u201d Those are what I call Republicans. That\u2019s why I got accused of saying\u2014which I did say\u2014there\u2019s Democrats, there\u2019s Republicans and then assholes. Sam: You know what, I can promise you this: If Trump had a venture firm, they\u2019d take huge fees. Jessica: We\u2019re also in this moment where Washington has taken on tech regulation. What do you think about how the administration has done? Vinod: If you look at the AI executive order, it was very bipartisan and agreed on. I spent a lot of time with the Hill [and] Valley Forum, both this year and a year ago. Almost every meeting I\u2019ve been to, half have been Republicans and [the] other have been Democrats. I do think policy has been reasonable and balanced. I think the Europeans, for example, have been sure they\u2019ll never participate in tech again. You know, they keep shooting themselves in the foot. There\u2019s always a degree of regulatory capture. And I do think that\u2019s somewhat true. But look, Disney was the one who extended copyrights. If you remember the late \u201990s copyright law, you know, beyond any reasonable measure of social good. That\u2019s just extended because we can\u2019t. I would like regulation that says no publication can publish an article where the headline isn\u2019t written by the writer. Headlines are written for clickbait. How can you be honest to let somebody who\u2019s not dealt with the story write the headline? Every major newspaper does it. Dave: I love that. Jessica: We could do a whole podcast on headlines. I mean, but this is a good example, actually. Like, today I wrote three headlines. I didn\u2019t actually like any of them. I put them into ChatGPT to\u2026unblock my headline writing. I didn\u2019t actually like ChatGPT\u2019s headlines either. Right. But like, that\u2019s surely not a\u2014that\u2019s like using spell check. Sam: With one of the headlines, did ChatGPT tell you to write it about strawberries? Jessica: No, but anyway, I could totally digress on that. Vinod: But you know The New York Times doesn\u2019t let the person doing the story write the headline. That\u2019s dishonest. Jessica: That\u2019s what the reporters say so that you call them back the next time. I\u2019ll give you the sideline on this. This is the old trick in the book. So you think we\u2019re in an OK and measured place on tech regulation. Sam: Do you think Biden is going to win? Vinod: No way of predicting. I do believe the only people who matter are the 5% in the middle, and they will be influenced by a recency bias of what happens after Labor Day. Between Labor Day and the election, there\u2019ll be a set of events, and they will bias things one way or another, whether it\u2019s an inflation announcement on the economy or an immigration incident or something else. Sam: Yeah, for what I mean, this is, I know we need to wrap it. I will say this, which is\u2026one of the people in our lives who\u2026works on our team, you know, made the point to me, which I think was right. She\u2019s, like, \u201cLook, in my community, Sam, no one cares or really understands any of these issues. But they really want to buy houses and they feel like they can\u2019t buy houses right now. And they like Trump not because of anything, but they think there\u2019s a higher likelihood to be able to buy a house.\u201d And it\u2019s just that simple. I think that\u2019s a lot of the 5%, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out. Vinod: No, I do think the 5% is a more thoughtful group. That\u2019s why they are undecided. They\u2019re in the middle, they\u2019re undecided, they see the costs and benefits. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the person who wants to buy a house. They\u2019re already decided where they are. Jessica: Can I add\u2014and Vinod, just to end, thank you so much. We covered a lot of ground and we\u2019re grateful. We\u2019ll never be this nice to each other again. Sam: And we were so nice because you were on the podcast. Brit: We\u2019re not usually this nice. Sam: I\u2019m not sure how this episode will perform. We\u2019ll see what the headline is, but you know, it\u2019s certainly the nicest we\u2019ve ever been. Dave: Yeah. Jessica: Well, but I just want to end by, like, what besides gardening, besides AI, besides robotics, besides saving the democratic process, like, what else? Sometimes I think we\u2019re too tunnel vision in Silicon Valley. Is there anything else you think we should be paying attention to or? Vinod: So an issue I worry a lot about is equality, inequality. In the U.S. I worry about inequality. In India I worry about ethnic strife. Leaving a community of Muslims behind is such a bad idea. Brit: Good garden pun, Jess. Vinod: It is the one thing that can slow up a rapidly growing economy. Now in different parts of the world, there are different issues. I think Europe is dealing with going too far dealing with DEI extremists. So they have extremists on the right now, and it will bounce between those extremes. Clearly just as they\u2019re MAGA extremists, there\u2019s DEI extremists. Sam: Amen. Vinod: But society bounces between extremes, and hopefully we can find a moderating influence. Sam: That\u2019s usually how it works, Vinod, is usually the moderating influence wins, not the bouncing between extremes. That\u2019s my experience of history, at least. Jessica: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re joking or not, Sam, but that\u2019s fine. OK. I don\u2019t have time to correct him. Thank you for joining us, gang. It was great to see you for another week. A big thanks to everyone for listening to the Back Channel.

        "heading": "Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang Is on Top of the World. So Why Is He Worried?",
        "author_name": "Anissa Gardizy",
        "publish_date": "Jun 18, 2024, 6:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "Around Christmas last year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called a series of meetings with company executives to discuss a growing concern: whether Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers were going to run out of data center space to install its artificial intelligence chips, which could hurt sales, according to someone who attended the meetings. Huang told colleagues he was worried cloud server providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft, which collectively have been buying about half of Nvidia\u2019s AI server chips in recent quarters, weren\u2019t moving fast enough to set up new data centers and power sources to accommodate the chips they had ordered, known as graphics processing units. After the meetings, Nvidia managers stepped up their pace of asking cloud providers whether they had enough space and electricity to accommodate their orders, according to an employee at Nvidia and several customers and data center operators. \u201cNvidia will not ship GPUs unless the customer can certify that they have data center capacity in which to place those GPUs,\u201d said Raul Martynek, CEO of DataBank, a data center provider whose clients include cloud providers. Huang has become a business rock star and the chief cheerleader of an AI boom that has propelled his microchip firm\u2019s once-in-a-generation growth and profits, lifting its value to the same $3 trillion level enjoyed by both Microsoft and Apple. But behind the glamour and well-deserved victory laps, Huang and his colleagues have also focused on countering the next threat to the business\u2014the likelihood that demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips will eventually slow down. To guard against that possibility, Nvidia has begun selling more software to AI developers and a year ago even set up its own server rental business, DGX Cloud. That move put it directly into competition with its biggest customers\u2014cloud providers such as Microsoft and AWS. Bizarrely enough, DGX Cloud operates on clusters of Nvidia-powered servers that it leases from those cloud providers. Nvidia then rents the servers to its own customers at a higher cost, promising them better computing performance. The move has created tensions within the industry. AWS, the biggest cloud provider, initially resisted letting Nvidia carve out its own rival business within AWS data centers. But after all of AWS\u2019 smaller rivals agreed to Nvidia\u2019s terms, AWS relented, saying it would offer DGX cloud with a newer Nvidia AI chip that other cloud providers didn't have yet. AWS also may have been concerned about upsetting a critical supplier at a time when its chips were hard to come by. AWS spokesperson Patrick Neighorn said that suggestion was speculative and incorrect. While Huang manages the new software and cloud efforts, he remains conscious of one factor that could affect sales: the fact that big tech companies buying his chips are making a large investment with an uncertain return. Microsoft, Meta, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI and others are using chips to train experimental new AI models, which do not immediately generate revenue. When Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the uncertainty about revenue in late April, the company\u2019s stock dropped sharply as investors expressed their dissatisfaction with the situation. It\u2019s conceivable investor pressure could prompt some of these companies to pull back on their chip purchases. With these issues in mind, Huang has been carefully managing how Nvidia allocates chips so no one company amasses too many of them, colleagues and customers say. He\u2019s also tried to influence how customers assemble GPUs in their data centers, pushing them to follow server-rack designs Nvidia thinks will lead to better computing performance. But following Nvidia\u2019s suggestions would make it harder for customers to shift to competing chips if they wanted to do so later, according to people at Nvidia and with some of its customers. This has led to periodic stand-offs with a key customer, Microsoft, over how the cloud provider planned to install Nvidia\u2019s forthcoming chips, said a person who has been involved in the talks. Nvidia also is looking to squeeze as much revenue as it can from the cables, racks and other hardware that connects the servers housing its chips, possibly at the expense of server manufacturers such as Dell that have long made servers with Nvidia chips. \u2018All of the Leverage\u2019 Nvidia\u2019s revenue from selling software and cloud services is tiny compared to its core server chip business. In August last year, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the new businesses already were on pace to generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually, and three months later she said that they would finish 2023 on pace to generate more than $1 billion annually, meaning they now contribute about 1% of Nvidia\u2019s total revenue. In contrast, its core server chip business generated $47.5 billion last year. In May, Nvidia disclosed that it had committed to spend nearly $9 billion on renting cloud servers from its top customers, mainly for internal research and development but also to boost its cloud server rental business. Some customers and former employees believe that business could eventually insulate Nvidia from an inevitable chip downturn and make it more difficult for customers who are renting its servers to pursue alternative chips. The cloud and software products are \u201cunderappreciated by the analysts and technology community\u201d as a business that could generate tens of billions of dollars a year in revenue, said Sasha Ostojic, a former Nvidia executive who is now a partner at venture firm Playground Global. \u201cNvidia has all of the leverage\u201d it needs to grow services that complement its chips, he said. Last fall, Nvidia even considered leasing its own data centers for DGX Cloud, according to a person who was involved in those discussions. Such a move would have cut out the cloud providers entirely. Nvidia also recently hired a senior Meta Platforms executive, Alexis Black Bjorlin, to run the cloud business, though it isn\u2019t clear whether Nvidia plans to move ahead with its own data centers for DGX Cloud. As Nvidia takes these steps, its salespeople are going to great lengths to understand what customers are doing with Nvidia\u2019s chips. Among the questions they\u2019re asking cloud providers lately is who their customers are and what kind of commitments they are signing to rent those servers. The answers could help Nvidia plan ahead for sales and could also help it learn about prospective customers for its own cloud server rental business. On top of being a potentially lucrative revenue stream, DGX Cloud has become a way for Nvidia to help some of its customers transition to its newer-generation chips. For example, software maker ServiceNow, which has historically bought Nvidia servers for its own data centers, now also rents these servers from Nvidia directly. Last year, when demand for GPUs was \u201cso high, I said, \u2018Hey, Jensen, I may need more [servers],\u2019\u201d said C.J. Desai, ServiceNow\u2019s president. Huang told him: \u201cThat\u2019s totally fine, but you should be able to burst the capacity into DGX Cloud.\u201d Desai said ServiceNow\u2019s AI ambitions are \u201cvery dependent\u201d on Nvidia\u2019s products, including software introduced earlier this year that helps companies run AI efficiently in their apps. Desai declined to discuss how much his company is spending on the products, but said the amount has been growing and ServiceNow has turned down offers from rival cloud and chip firms because its engineers strongly prefer Nvidia\u2019s \u201cfull stack.\u201d An Nvidia spokesperson declined to make Huang available for an interview for this article. \u201cWe prove our value to customers every day. Nvidia offers customers the lowest total cost of ownership, exceptional performance, and innovations at every layer of the stack\u2014from chips to systems to software and algorithms,\u201d the spokesperson said. Huang\u2019s moves reflect his paranoia as a founder who has survived multiple moments of near doom during the company\u2019s history, including after it went public in 1999. The Christmastime meetings last year, for instance, could merely be part of the formula that has carried the company to great heights\u2014turning its GPUs into the lifeblood of OpenAI, biotech and pharmaceutical firms, quant trading firms and scores of other AI developers. \u201cThere\u2019s no complacency at Nvidia,\u201d said Jeff Herbst, a venture capitalist who spent two decades at Nvidia leading business development and acquisitions until 2021. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really know whether times are good or times are bad from the tone or the tenor of the meetings.\u201d \u2018Taylor Swift for Tech\u2019 Nvidia got its start 31 years ago selling GPUs for PC gaming systems. Huang laid the foundation for Nvidia\u2019s recent ascent in 2006 by launching Compute Unified Device Architecture, a programming language that taps into computing power provided by graphics chips. CUDA saved developers time by automating the process of building applications that harnessed the chips. In recent years CUDA has become a major factor in Nvidia\u2019s sales: Millions of programmers don\u2019t want to bother learning how to program with rival chips. Nvidia sales began soaring in the 2010s, after AI developers such as Google began utilizing the chips to train large machine-learning models known as deep neural networks. Those AI models helped companies tailor websites and advertisements to individual customers, as well as boosting the accuracy of facial recognition and voice assistants\u2019 ability to recognize people\u2019s voices. Huang has also had misses, including an audacious effort to develop software, not just chips, for self-driving cars, which involved hiring a substantial team of engineers. The plan didn\u2019t work out. But the company got a boost in 2019 following its $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, which gave it a stronger foothold in corporate data centers\u2014locations where its AI chips have increasingly ended up. \u201cHe wants to revolutionize health care, robotics, manufacturing, and in order to do that, he thinks, \u2018What do I need to do now to enable that?\u2019\u201d said Umesh Padval, a venture capitalist who was on the board of Mellanox when Nvidia bought it. OpenAI\u2019s launch of ChatGPT, built using Nvidia chips in Microsoft data centers, sparked a nearly unprecedented boom for the chipmaker. Nearly every major technology firm and countless other developers scrambled for GPUs to develop their own conversational AI and models that generate images and video based on descriptions of what people want to see. Nvidia also has provided capital to scores of those developers, including Mistral, Cohere, Runway, Wayve, Figure and Perplexity. Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization has risen eight times to $3.2 trillion since ChatGPT\u2019s launch, and on June 5 Nvidia briefly overtook Apple as the world\u2019s second most valuable public company. At Computex, the tech industry conference in Taipei the first week of June, throngs of press chased Huang around town. In an indication of Huang\u2019s stardom, a \u201cJensen Huang food map\u201d illustrating eateries patronized by the black-leather-jacketed executive was hailed online as the hippest Taipei gourmet guide. \u201cHe\u2019s like Taylor Swift, but for tech,\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Instagram after posting a photo of himself with Huang in March. Though the 61-year-old Huang has soaked up the limelight, he has been managing tricky relationships with companies like Microsoft that are buying Nvidia\u2019s chips while at the same time trying to lessen their reliance on those chips. Microsoft, AWS and other cloud providers have experienced a resurgence of demand for traditional computing workloads, not just AI, so they can\u2019t afford to expand their data centers only to accommodate Nvidia chips, according to two people who work for one of the major cloud providers, as well as executives of several data center operators. Don\u2019t Get \u2018Sunned\u2019 There is an inherent vulnerability in the business of selling chips on a one-off basis: As fast as sales have been rising, they could drop as demand inevitably cools off. For Nvidia, a future without a steady new profit stream might not be pretty: As numerous commentators have pointed out, in 2000, Cisco Systems suddenly became the world\u2019s most valuable company from selling routers at the height of the dot-com bubble, when telecom built new data centers, only to watch those centers go unused as internet-based revenue failed to materialize the way technology executives and investors thought it would. Cisco hasn\u2019t recovered from the sales dropoff it experienced as its hardware became a widely available commodity. Privately, Huang has told colleagues Nvidia must make sure it doesn\u2019t end up like companies such as Cisco or Sun Microsystems, referring to their quick rise and eventual fall. Sun became a juggernaut in server and computer hardware in the 1990s, but after the bubble burst, the company didn\u2019t capitalize on the burgeoning software market, which Microsoft and others captured. \u201cHe tries to remind people not to get \u2018Sunned,\u2019\u201d said one Nvidia employee who has heard him say it. Over the past few months, Nvidia has launched several software products it hopes will diversify its business from hardware. On an earnings call in February, Huang described the business, Nvidia AI Enterprise, as an \u201coperating system for artificial intelligence\u201d that customers would use to train and run AI. Nvidia charges $4,500 per GPU per year for access to the software. \u201cMy guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company\u2026will run on Nvidia AI Enterprise,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd so this is going to likely be a very significant business over time.\u201d Nvidia has said design software maker Adobe and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike are among the customers for the system. \u201cHe is not selling chips\u2014he is selling GPUs, software and systems for modern data centers,\u201d Padval said. \u201cPeople think it is just a GPU company, but it is much more than that.\u201d To be sure, there\u2019s no imminent risk to Nvidia\u2019s hardware sales. The company has generated $40 billion in free cash flow in the nine months that ended in April thanks to its unrivaled technology, and it says demand for the next flagship chips, due out later this year, are through the roof. Even if the software business doesn\u2019t grow as quickly as Nvidia hopes, it could drive more loyalty to the company\u2019s chips and shield its core business from cheaper competitors down the line\u2014including the AI chips each of the major cloud providers is trying to sell as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s. \u201cIf you\u2019re Nvidia, what you really want is this very powerful flywheel of better software services that keep customers in your orbit,\u201d said Aaron Levie, CEO of storage firm Box, which rents Nvidia GPUs and resells Nvidia\u2019s software for running AI to its own customers. \u201cI think that [Huang]\u2019s running that playbook quite well.\u201d As he tries to build new software businesses, Huang is attempting to maximize the growth of hardware sales while ensuring no single customer gets leverage over Nvidia. That might explain last week\u2019s announcement that Oracle, a relatively small cloud server provider, would obtain a large number of Nvidia chips and start renting them out to Microsoft and OpenAI by early next year. Microsoft would have preferred to purchase those chips directly, though one person with knowledge of the deal said it might have struggled to find space and power for that many new chips. Huang also has maintained a special relationship with CoreWeave, another small cloud provider whose revenue last year soared to hundreds of millions of dollars, up from $25 million in 2022, after it got generous allotments of Nvidia GPUs at the expense of bigger cloud providers. Microsoft also had to rent GPU server capacity from CoreWeave to meet its needs. Tussling With Microsoft In another effort to generate more hardware revenue, Nvidia is trying to have more influence over how its largest customers buy and install its GPUs. Typically, large cloud providers build their own customer server racks, which they use across their global data centers and for various kinds of chips. But when Nvidia approached customers about its next flagship chip, the GB200, it tried to convince them to buy the rack exactly as it had designed it, according to several people who have been involved in the talks. Microsoft and Nvidia feuded over the issue for several weeks this year. Andrew Bell, a vice president at Nvidia, asked counterparts at Microsoft to buy a server rack design that was a few inches different in measurement from the racks Microsoft uses in its data centers, according to someone who was involved in the talks. Such a change would hinder Microsoft\u2019s ability to easily switch between different AI chips. Bell said customers who agreed to buy Nvidia\u2019s server rack design could be first in line to receive its new chips, but Microsoft executives demurred. Microsoft executives had already felt pressured to buy Nvidia\u2019s networking cables, which connect Nvidia servers to each other, because they believed  Nvidia would prioritize such purchases over those that involved only its GPUs, according to a former Microsoft executive who was involved in it. Nvidia networking chips and cables accounted for roughly a third of the money Microsoft was spending on Nvidia products as of early 2023, this person said. The dispute over the server rack design eventually reached the desks of Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott and CEO Satya Nadella, said one of the people who was involved. In the end, Nvidia backed down and agreed to let Microsoft design its own custom racks for the GB200 chips. (Google and AWS are also expected to produce custom racks for GB200s, according to two Nvidia employees.) But Nvidia may still end up making more money from the GB200 racks smaller customers buy. In a change from prior years, Nvidia this year plans to design and procure the materials for servers and racks that hold GB200 chips before handing them off to the server manufacturers that build and ultimately sell them, according to two Nvidia employees who have been involved in the plan. The change would hurt server makers Dell, HPE and Supermicro, which have predominantly designed such hardware in the past. Those companies generate a higher margin from the racks they design than from using Nvidia\u2019s designs, according to a manager at a major server assembler. (Spokespeople and executives from Dell and Supermicro didn\u2019t respond to written requests for comment. A spokesperson from HPE declined to comment. ) Driving a Ferrari in the City Another issue looms for the GPU business. While the biggest technology companies have the expertise to handle Nvidia\u2019s most advanced chips, which require special cooling and other conditions, many startups, multinationals, governments and academic buyers do not, according to some of these customers as well as the companies that do business with them. So as Nvidia flagship H100 chips have become easier to find this year following a prolonged shortage last year, less-sophisticated buyers haven\u2019t been using them the way they are intended\u2014essentially, it\u2019s like they\u2019re driving a Ferrari on slow city streets. That means as Nvidia chips become more expensive, some of these customers may not want to upgrade. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that oftentimes you don\u2019t need the latest generation of Nvidia GPU to get great performance,\u201d said Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, which operates a cloud service. Aiming to head off such concerns, Nvidia\u2019s Kress said in May that purchases of GPUs by governments or government-backed companies would lead to sales in the \u201chigh-single-digit billions\u201d this year, implying that the customer segment had plenty of steam left. Still, the price to rent Nvidia\u2019s H100 chips in the cloud has fallen nearly 30% in the past year, and that could indicate a slowdown is coming, said Dylan Patel, chief analyst at chip research firm SemiAnalysis, which also monitors cloud provider prices. Compared to last year, companies can also more easily rent the chips without committing to multiyear deals with cloud providers, he said.

        "body_content": "EssilorLuxottica might not be a household name in the U.S. But the eyeglass giant, maker of Meta Platforms\u2019 smart Ray-Ban glasses as well as dozens of other eyewear brands, is suddenly a company tech firms want to buddy up with. Rocco Basilico, the 34-year-old Italian head of EssilorLuxottica\u2019s wearables business, revealed in an interview that the company had been getting approaches from some big tech companies interested in \u201csmart eyewear.\u201d He said EssilorLuxottica had \u201ctalked\u201d with some of the tech giants but the \u201conly ongoing partnership with big tech is the relationship that we have with Meta.\u201d As for other deals, \u201cthere is nothing concrete,\u201d he said. Tech firms\u2019 recent interest in EssilorLuxottica comes as several, including Apple and Google, contemplate ways of incorporating AI into wearable devices, from earbuds to eyeglasses. Meta has already taken that step, incorporating its AI assistant into the latest version of its smart Ray-Bans. Basilico declined to comment on the status of EssilorLuxottica\u2019s deal with Meta but said \u201cthe intention is to work for many years together.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether the Meta deal limits the European company\u2019s ability to work with other tech firms. People working in the tech industry say EssilorLuxottica is appealing as a potential partner because it can handle the manufacturing and distribution of glasses, as well as design and prescription lenses. Aside from its deal with Meta, the company\u2019s Luxottica eyewear arm\u2014before it merged with French optical lens firm Essilor in 2018\u2014previously worked with Google and Intel on eyeglass projects. The European company is a slightly odd fit in the world of Silicon Valley. Its bread-and-butter business is designing, making and selling eyeglasses and sunglasses. It owns eyewear brands including Oakley, Ray-Ban and Oliver Peoples, as well as eyewear store chains such as LensCrafters and Sunglass Hut. But Basilico made it clear the company is keen to expand in smart glasses. EssilorLuxottica spent \u20ac600 million on research and development related to smart glasses in 2023 (total operating expenses were \u20ac12.8 billion, while revenue was \u20ac25 billion). Last year, the company acquired an Israeli startup called Nuance Hearing as part of a plan to develop a product that blends eyeglasses with hearing-aid technology. \u201cSmart eyewear\u2014and even more with this new wave of AI\u2014they\u2019re going to become part of our life,\u201d Basilico said, speaking over the phone on a pair of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses while walking around his office in West Hollywood. \u201cAs a leading company, we couldn\u2019t just stay out of this game, this race.\u201d Even before AI increased tech company interest in smart glasses, EssilorLuxottica executives had concerns about potential competition. Multiple former Meta employees said staff from EssilorLuxottica told staff at Meta they were worried about the risk of Apple disrupting the smart glasses market as it had done with watches. Basilico said the company views the uptick in interest in smart glasses as a positive, adding, \u201cWe keep an eye on all competitors equally.\u201d Apple has reportedly explored the possibility of developing smart glasses with audio and AI features. Meanwhile, Amazon also sells smart glasses that incorporate its Alexa voice assistant. Basilico, a stepson of the late EssilorLuxottica chair Leonardo Del Vecchio, likes to cultivate an image of EssilorLuxottica as an innovator that wants to push beyond the company\u2019s traditional business. He was a key figure in brokering the initial deal with Meta, and he has appeared in promotional videos alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Still, while the company set up a dedicated manufacturing facility in China to make Meta\u2019s smart glasses, it has so far not built out technical teams in-house to develop the smart technology. Mostly it has relied on partnerships with tech companies. And despite Basilico\u2019s enthusiasm, questions persist about the public appetite for smart glasses\u2014and whether that appetite is anywhere close to the ambitions of the companies making those devices. When Meta and EssilorLuxottica released the first version of the Ray-Ban smart glasses in 2021, the devices didn\u2019t gain much traction with users. A 2023 Wall Street Journal report, citing an internal Meta document, said that less than 10% of the glasses purchased since the product\u2019s launch were actively being used by the people who bought them. \u201cI will not say that it was not a success,\u201d Basilico said of the first iteration of the glasses. \u201cIt was just the first trial of two big companies working together.\u201d The second version, which was recently updated to incorporate Meta\u2019s AI assistant, has been performing well, Basilico said, though he declined to give sales figures. A current Meta employee said customers have been subject to long wait times because demand for the glasses has been higher than anticipated. Long View The deal between Meta and EssilorLuxottica began to germinate back in 2018 when Basilico sent Zuckerberg a cold email with a brief pitch. He got a response two days later. In 2019, Zuckerberg flew to Milan to meet with Basilico and Del Vecchio, then chair. The three boarded a helicopter to Agordo, a town north of Venice, and toured Luxottica\u2019s factory there. By the end of the visit, Basilico said, they had reached an informal agreement: The two companies would collaborate on Ray-Ban glasses equipped with cameras and audio features. Though Zuckerberg was energized after the visit, the project was polarizing inside Meta. Andrew \u201cBoz\u201d Bosworth, who leads Meta\u2019s Reality Labs division overseeing hardware, was initially against the idea, and argued the company should instead focus its energies on building augmented reality glasses, The Information previously reported. Zuckerberg felt, however, that AR glasses would take years to be ready and wanted a simpler project in the interim. Once it was underway, EssilorLuxottica gave Meta \u201cboundaries\u201d when it came to the design of the glasses, according to Basilico. \u201cI think we were very firm with Meta about not compromising on style, dimension, weight,\u201d he said. In the past year the smart glasses have become a higher priority inside Meta, particularly after the newest version was updated to include Meta\u2019s AI assistant, and demand grew. Zuckerberg said on Meta\u2019s earnings call in late April that the glasses were \u201csold out in many styles and colors. So we\u2019re working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we can.\u201d The companies have released a new \u201ccat-eye\u201d design, he said, adding that they would offer \u201can increasing diversity of options over time.\u201d \u201cIf we want everyone to be able to use wearable AI, I think eyewear is a bit different from phones or watches in that people are going to want very different designs,\u201d he said. It remains to be seen how deep EssilorLuxottica will get into the smart glasses market. Making simple glasses with plastic frames that sell for hundreds of dollars is a lucrative business. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which require significantly more investment to produce, retail for as low as $299. For many Silicon Valley companies, making AR glasses that overlay digital images and characters on the real world is the ultimate goal. Apple is betting big on AR, and the company aims to one day replace the iPhone with lightweight glasses, The Information previously reported. However, the technical hurdles involved in creating AR displays, and making such glasses usable for long periods, are immense: Apple and Meta have both scaled back work on AR glasses in recent years and pushed out their timelines for release as a result. EssilorLuxottica is also feeling out the possibilities with AR. This January, it announced it was leading a new project named Popular, which is funded by the European Commission and involves 10 partners from around Europe, with the goal of building prototypes for AR glasses. Basilico said EssilorLuxottica was interested in AR, but he declined to give details. \u201cI still think it\u2019s early on,\u201d he said, adding that he hasn\u2019t yet seen a \u201cbreakthrough technology.\u201d Sylvia Varnham O'Regan is a reporter for The Information, covering social media companies.

        "heading": "A New (and Better) Approach to Measuring LLMs\u2019 Intelligence Has Arrived",
        "author_name": "Stephanie Palazzolo",
        "publish_date": "Jun 20, 2024, 7:45am PDT",
        "body_content": "Finally, there\u2019s good news from the never-ending quest to evaluate how good a large language model is.  LMSYS, an organization that benchmarks LLMs, released findings last month on how the performance of LLMs changed between normal queries and harder ones that require more reasoning capabilities. LMSYS uses \u201cElo rankings,\u201d a measure of relative performance\u2014so you\u2019d expect the performance metrics to remain the same in both cases.  Instead, it found that many models\u2014including Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, Cohere's Command R+ and Meta Platforms' Llama 3\u2014saw a marked decline in performance when moving from normal to hard prompts. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus were among the few that maintained their performance. Check out the bottom of their blog post here for examples of these \u201chard\u201d questions, like coding problems. (Gemini Ultra wasn\u2019t included in this analysis because it\u2019s still not widely available to developers through an application programming interface.) The decline in performance from so many LLMs could be a sign that LLMs still aren\u2019t very good at complex reasoning today, said Ion Stoica, a Berkeley computer science professor who also runs LMSYS, noting that OpenAI and Anthropic might have developed special techniques to give models some of those skills. (Stoica is also a cofounder of AI startup Anyscale and enterprise software firm Databricks). OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s advantage might be the use of synthetic data, or data that\u2019s generated by other AI models to fill in gaps in training data, he said. (Remember Q*?) OpenAI and Anthropic aren\u2019t particularly open about their training data, but you can see an example of what synthetic data can do to boost LLM reasoning in this paper from Meta, in which researchers gave an LLM three example prompt-response pairs and then asked the LLM to generate a fourth example. As simple as that sounds, showing an LLM more examples of complex question-answer pairs can be extremely helpful in improving its reasoning capabilities, Stoica said. (Unlimited training data hack unlocked!) Some AI founders said some models\u2019 decline in performance answering hard prompts could suggest the models are being trained to ace LMSYS evaluations. Think of it like a student who memorizes test questions before taking the test and isn\u2019t able to answer different or more complex questions. As more non-English speaking countries push to develop their own LLMs in their local languages, more LLM evaluations may start to break out the models\u2019 performance in non-English languages. That\u2019s a change LMSYS has made. Though more than 60% of the conversations users have with models on LMSYS are in English, a solid chunk are in Chinese and Russian, at 11% and 8%, respectively, Stoica said.  Overall, however, the last six months have seen open-weight models approach the performance of closed-weight ones, which makes comparing them more difficult, Stoica said. (To be fair, he did add that OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o was a significant step up in performance.) Soon, developers choosing which LLM to use may have to look at more subjective measures, such as how funny, entertaining, casual or articulate an LLM\u2019s responses are, he said. We can already see this at LLM companies like xAI, with its \u201canti-woke\u201d Grok model, and OpenAI, whose choice of an \u201coverly flirty\u201d voice with GPT-4o may have to do more with psychology than you think. Here\u2019s what else is going on\u2026 On Wednesday, the best papers at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference, or CVPR, were announced. These included papers highlighting a new approach to modeling movement from a single still picture; a dataset of human feedback to improve image generation; a fix for image generation errors that occur when creating new photos of the same item at different angles or distances; and a vision foundation model for the tree of life.

        "heading": "OpenAI CEO Says Company Could Become Benefit Corporation Akin to Rivals Anthropic, xAI",
        "author_name": "Aaron Holmes",
        "publish_date": "Jun 14, 2024, 5:09pm PDT",
        "body_content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently told some shareholders that the artificial intelligence developer is considering changing its governance structure to a for-profit business that OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit board doesn\u2019t control, according to a person who heard the comments. One scenario Altman said the board is considering is a for-profit benefit corporation, which rivals such as Anthropic and xAI are using, this person said. Such a change could open the door to an eventual initial public offering of OpenAI, which currently sports a private valuation of $86 billion, and may give Altman an opportunity to take a stake in the fast-growing company, a move some investors have been pushing. The restructuring discussions are fluid, and Altman and his fellow directors could ultimately decide to take a different approach. Altman\u2019s comments were part of longer discussions about overhauling OpenAI\u2019s structure while still maintaining a connection to the original nonprofit he cofounded. For shareholders including Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in the unit, drama involving the nonprofit board and Altman last fall exposed the current structure\u2019s fragility. The board fired Altman, sparking an employee revolt inside the for-profit unit that ended when Altman was rehired. Benefit corporations are legally protected from minority shareholders who might otherwise sue the company for making decisions that don\u2019t prioritize shareholder returns. The new entity could also maintain a mission similar to that of the current OpenAI nonprofit\u2014AI for the benefit of humanity\u2014while giving investors a chance to more quickly realize a return on the $14 billion or so in capital they\u2019ve put in. Even so, some current investors say there is little pressure on the company to go public since it can continue to allow existing employees and others to sell their shares through regular secondary-share offerings, such as those done by SpaceX and Stripe. OpenAI conducted two such offerings for employees over the last year in which they collectively cashed out more than $800 million, said a person with knowledge of the deals. In a statement, a spokesperson for OpenAI said, \u201cWe remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone and as we\u2019ve previously shared we\u2019re working with our board to ensure that we\u2019re best positioned to succeed in our mission.\u201d They added: \u201cThe nonprofit is core to our mission and will continue to exist.\u201d Microsoft Execs Push For-Profit Option Some senior Microsoft executives involved in the company\u2019s relationship with OpenAI have for years favored converting OpenAI into a full-fledged for-profit. Such a structure could give the software giant more influence over OpenAI in the form of a seat on its board as well as shareholder voting rights, according to one of those executives. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. In an unusual arrangement, the nonprofit, established in 2015 as a research lab, oversees the for-profit, set up in 2019. The for-profit has promised to pay Microsoft and other investors a share of any profits it generates up to a certain cap that will increase year after year. (Microsoft gets 75% of OpenAI\u2019s profits until the capital investment is paid back, and 49% of subsequent profits up to a certain cap.) No outside investors hold a seat on the nonprofit\u2019s eight-person board, although Microsoft has a nonvoting observer position. A new structure theoretically could remove profit caps for shareholders. Altman didn\u2019t take equity in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit arm when he started it, as he wished to limit the number of board directors with shares. Now he could end up with a significant equity package. Investors have privately said they prefer that he have such a package so he isn\u2019t as incentivized to focus on other projects and investments in other AI companies. Such a change in structure could also make it easier for Altman to attract the amount of capital he has said the company might need\u2014up to $100 billion. The discussions come as the company accelerates its revenue growth. The ChatGPT maker has surpassed $3.4 billion in annualized revenue, a measure of the past month\u2019s revenue multiplied by 12, more than doubling the number from about six months ago. Aside from Microsoft, the investors who have put money directly into OpenAI include Reid Hoffman's foundation, Khosla Ventures, Y Combinator (which Altman previously ran), Y Combinator partner Paul Buchheit and the University of Michigan. Firms such as Thrive Capital, Sequoia Capital and Founders Fund have purchased shares from earlier investors or employees over the years. The nonprofit has a stake in the for-profit unit as well. Before Microsoft became an investor, the nonprofit contributed more capital than each of the other shareholders, according to a person with knowledge of the deal. To end the nonprofit\u2019s control over the new benefit corporation, the nonprofit would likely need to sell at least part of its ownership interest, according to Jonathan Storper, a partner at San Francisco\u2013based law firm Hanson Bridgett who helped draft the California benefit corporation law in 2012. Finding buyers for the shares isn\u2019t likely to be difficult. Smaller investors have clamored to buy shares in OpenAI and its rivals, often through special purpose vehicles set up to acquire them from existing investors. Kate Clark contributed to this article.

        "heading": "Apple Aims to Cut Headcount on Some iPhone Assembly Lines by Up to 50%",
        "author_name": "Wayne Ma",
        "publish_date": "Jun 24, 2024, 6:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "It was the kind of incident Apple executives never want to repeat. In November 2022, at a factory in Zhengzhou, China\u2014the largest plant in the world for making iPhones\u2014police officers in white hazmat suits beat factory workers, who had begun protesting over strict Covid-19 lockdowns and disputes over pay. Video of the episode, which took place at a factory operated by Foxconn, Apple\u2019s largest manufacturing partner, circulated on social media, while the disruptions caused iPhone shortages, leading to a sales decline for the smartphone that holiday season. Soon after, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of operations, Sabih Khan, issued an edict to his organization, instructing managers to reduce the number of workers on iPhone final assembly lines by as much as 50% over the next few years, said two former Apple employees. To accomplish that, Apple began greenlighting automation projects for its assembly lines that it had previously mothballed due to high up-front costs, they said. The efforts resulted in a significant amount of automation handling the final assembly for last year\u2019s iPhone 15, according to three people involved in its manufacturing. Apple\u2019s push for automation could be transformative for the global consumer electronics industry. If Apple can one day more fully automate iPhone production, it would be able to move more of its manufacturing operations from China to countries like Vietnam and India, where experienced manufacturing engineers are harder to come by, according to former Apple manufacturing managers. Reducing its reliance on China has become more important for Apple due to labor disruptions such as those in Zhengzhou, along with growing tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and Taiwan. Automating more of the production of its devices could even eventually help Apple bring more manufacturing back to the U.S., the former Apple managers say\u2014though that likely wouldn\u2019t mean large quantities of factory jobs. Over time, increasing automation could also have far-reaching consequences for China\u2019s manufacturing industry, which contributes millions of workers to Apple\u2019s supply chain each year.  No other consumer electronics brand operating in the country has the scale to absorb these workers if they become unemployed. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment Already Apple appears to have reduced the number of people who work on manufacturing its products in China. Earlier this year, Apple disclosed in an annual report on its supply chain that the total number of employees it monitors at its manufacturing partners for work-hour compliance shrank to more than 1.4 million in 2023 from a peak of more than 1.6 million in 2022. It was the first time that figure shrank year to year in over a decade of Apple publishing the reports. The number of workers fell even as the number of factories Apple monitors in the report increased to over 380 from more than 300 a year earlier. Apple ships roughly 200 million iPhones a year, accounting for more than half its sales. As a result, the majority of the workers in its supply chain are involved in assembling the iPhone and its related components, according to multiple former Apple employees. In the past, Foxconn\u2019s Zhengzhou factory has employed as many as 300,000 people, who work 12-hour shifts, six days a week, earning at least $800 a month. To carry out its automation plans, Apple has begun acquiring machine-learning startups to help it replace people who inspect products on its assembly lines. Earlier this year, it bought Canadian startup DarwinAI, which uses computer vision to inspect components like printed circuit boards for defects. The startup also made small machine learning models that can run on iPhones. If iPhones could test themselves, Apple wouldn\u2019t need to purchase testing equipment at a massive scale. That could make it faster and cheaper to test and calibrate the devices coming off the assembly line in factories, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. And last year, Apple acquired another startup,  Palo Alto, Calif.\u2013based Drishti, that helps it analyze video footage of its assembly lines to identify bottlenecks and production problems in real time, the person said. Bloomberg earlier reported on the DarwinAI deal; Apple\u2019s acquisition of Drishti hasn\u2019t been previously reported. Rising Labor Costs For a device as high tech as the iPhone, putting each one together has long been an intensely manual process. In Zhengzhou, for example, workers sit shoulder to shoulder, welding, soldering, screwing and snapping iPhone components into place across more than 100 assembly lines. The lines can each be up to five football fields long from one end to the other, according to multiple people who work in iPhone assembly. Each line can have more than 1,000 workers and produce between 300 and 600 iPhones an hour. Within the facility, there are separate areas known as subassembly lines where workers prep individual modules such as the main logic board, speakers, receivers, buttons, cameras, wireless charging coils, microphones and chassis for assembly into completed products, the people said. That often involves attaching metal brackets and routing flexible printed circuit boards around the components before they can be plugged into the main logic board. For years, Apple has dabbled in automation projects for making the iPhone\u2014with mixed results, as The Information reported in 2020. Originally, rising labor costs in China, a desire to increase the consistency of its products and the growing difficulty of recruiting workers to monotonous factory jobs prompted those efforts, said multiple former Apple employees who worked in operations. But other forces were at play too. Each year, iPhones become more and more difficult to assemble as they become more sophisticated. High turnover at the factories that assemble iPhones in China meant Apple and its manufacturing partners had to break down the assembly of the iPhone into simpler tasks to make it easier for inexperienced workers to complete them. But that meant total headcount at iPhone factories continued to rise as Apple added more stations on assembly lines to accomplish those simpler tasks, former Apple employees said. In 2016, Apple conducted a study of the time it took to assemble iPhones and discovered that manual labor comprised just a quarter of the process, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The remaining time consisted of transporting components and materials within the factory or simply waiting for other stations to become ready. Apple executives realized that there was lots of room to automate more of the iPhone\u2019s assembly and reduce bottlenecks on the line, which could increase the line\u2019s productivity while also reducing headcount. Apple\u2019s early efforts to automate parts of its manufacturing process began with products that had lower sales volumes than the iPhone, such as MacBooks, iPads and Apple Watches. The company deemed automating some of the production of those devices less risky and capital intensive than it would be for the iPhone, according to former Apple employees who worked in its operations group. In contrast, senior Apple executives were far more cautious about automating iPhone production, concerned that the risks of failure were too high, those former employees said. In internal meetings at Apple, managers often discussed a cautionary tale: Tesla\u2019s efforts to heavily automate the production of its Model 3 sedan at a factory in Fremont, Calif., which turned out to be a disastrous move. The electric automaker eventually made more of the process manual to speed up production. Another topic in those discussions was the aversion Apple CEO Tim Cook and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams have for fully automated assembly lines, born out of their experience at IBM in the 1990s, where the duo worked previously. Apple also found it difficult to justify the cost of machinery that might only be used for a single year before the iPhone goes through a design refresh, which would render that equipment obsolete. Other industries, such as automobile manufacturing, can spread the cost of automated equipment over a decade or more as they tend to make the same parts for longer periods of time. Apple\u2019s mindset on the costs of automation began to change during the pandemic, though. The supply disruptions, prompted partly by China\u2019s brutal Covid-19 lockdowns, convinced executives that automating more of Apple\u2019s production was worth the cost, multiple former employees said. Stubborn Screws The leader of Apple\u2019s iPhone automation efforts is Peter Thompson, an Apple vice president and 16-year veteran of the company, who first cut his teeth as a vehicle engineer at Ford, according to five former Apple employees who have worked with him. Thompson is known for his ability to execute and drill deep into the details. His recent projects for the company include developing a semi-automated factory in the U.S., which performs personalized engravings on Apple products. Thompson took on the project, which included a $100 million investment by Apple, after he bought Apple products for his family one Christmas, only to discover with embarrassment that the engravings had been done incorrectly, said a person who spoke to him. Over the past year, Thompson\u2019s team has successfully automated parts of the iPhone\u2019s assembly, working closely with manufacturing partners such as Foxconn, Luxshare Precision and Pegatron. Those successes include machines that install metal brackets and flexible printed circuit boards onto components without human aid, said multiple people with direct knowledge of the effort. These and similar efforts have allowed Apple and its partners to eliminate positions for thousands of workers in China, according to people who work in Apple\u2019s supply chain. For some processes, they have reduced headcount by as much as 30%, according to one employee at an iPhone manufacturing partner. Still, Apple has run into some hitches. In some cases, it has pressured its manufacturing partners to pay for automation equipment so it can avoid the expense itself, said multiple people familiar with its supplier relationships. The machines can add up to hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenditures each year given their complexity. Some of those manufacturers don\u2019t want to buy the equipment because of how specialized it is for iPhone production, which limits their ability to use it to make devices for other clients. They also worry they won\u2019t see a return on their investment in the equipment if Apple changes the design of the iPhone too much in its next models. Apple typically wins in those discussions because of its ability to play one supplier off another. And some steps in the production process have proved stubbornly resistant to automation. This year, Apple sought to build on some of its automation successes by using machines to install the iPhone\u2019s buttons, receiver, speaker and main logic board into its chassis, according to three people who worked in Apple\u2019s supply chain. But the machines stumbled in properly fastening those components, which have to be carefully screwed into position at odd angles, the people said. Late in the development of the iPhone 16\u2014the latest model of the device, due out in the fall\u2014Apple canceled plans to automate these processes because of the high rate of defects, two of the people said. The decision meant Apple and its partners will have to delay their headcount reduction targets for at least another year, they said. Correction: An earlier version of this story referred to drone footage showing a deserted Foxconn factory in Nanning, China. That factory didn't previously make Apple devices.

        "body_content": "In March, a group of VIPs piled into Qasr Al Sarab, a luxury resort two hours\u2019 drive from Abu Dhabi, for an invite-only event co-hosted by Mubadala Investment Co., a $300 billion sovereign wealth fund based in the United Arab Emirates. It was the same hotel where, two years earlier, cast members of \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d had gotten their beauty sleep when they weren\u2019t shooting the sci-fi epic in the vast Emirati desert. Instead of Hollywood royalty, the cast of the March event consisted of Rohit Sipahimalani, chief investment officer of Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Temasek; former SoftBank executive Marcelo Claure; Barry Sternlicht, the billionaire CEO of Starwood Capital Group; Lux Capital co-founder Josh Wolfe; General Catalyst co-founder David Fialkow; and Jason Calacanis, host of the \u201cAll-In\u201d podcast. Attendees took turns holding a falcon, riding sand boards and camels, and zipping around a Formula One track in Abu Dhabi, according to one attendee. \u201cIt brought a lot of great people to Abu Dhabi so they could see the transformation that\u2019s happening,\u201d said Ibrahim Ajami, Mubadala\u2019s head of venture capital investments and its public face, in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly becoming a place where you\u2019re not just flying in and presenting to the large sovereign wealth funds\u2014you\u2019re thinking about, \u2018What are the market opportunities for me here? What are the opportunities to build a business here?\u2019\u201d The event was a show of muscle for the venture arm of Mubadala (pronounced Moo-BAH-da-la), which is trying to shed its reputation as merely a writer of checks for the funds of other investors, especially prominent Silicon Valley VC firms. For Mubadala\u2019s next act, Ajami is seeking to milk his tech connections to put more money directly into startups. At the same time, Mubadala is increasingly using its clout to encourage Western companies and investors to deepen their ties to the UAE\u2019s tech ecosystem, part of the country\u2019s broader push to diversify its economy away from oil. Those energy resources\u2014and the promise of lower costs for running power-hungry data centers\u2014are also an important part of Mubadala\u2019s pitch for bringing more founders to the region. For Ajami, 49, the goal is for Mubadala\u2014a term that means \u201cexchange\u201d in Arabic\u2014to one day be mentioned in the same breath as Sand Hill Road\u2019s most vaunted investment firms. \u201cThe way founders speak about Sequoia\u2014why not, 20 years from now, won\u2019t they speak that way about Mubadala?\u201d asked Ajami. Ajami has a ways to go before he gets Mubadala there. Mubadala has stumbled badly in Europe as it has tried to employ a strategy similar to the one it used to break into the U.S. The companies it has backed in Europe have performed so poorly that Mubadala has put Jonno Elliott\u2014who joined the firm in 2022 after leading VC investments at Virgin Management Ltd.\u2014in charge of salvaging its portfolio of companies from the region, according to a person who spoke to Elliott. Among some European investors and founders, it has developed a reputation for aggressive tactics that could impact its ability to invest in top European companies in the future. A Mubadala spokesperson said Elliott has \u201cstepped in to assist companies in overcoming challenges when his expertise was needed.\u201d And while plenty of tech investors speak highly of Mubadala, many of them are eager to curry favor with the deep-pocketed firm so it continues to invest in their funds, especially in the current dismal fundraising environment for VC firms. Privately, after singing the praises of Mubadala as a limited partner, many venture capitalists have also said its direct investments in startups don\u2019t carry the weight of other investors\u2019 bets. Sovereign wealth funds just don\u2019t have the track record of picking winners that VC firms do, those critics say. Still, Mubadala has had some notable successes. Ajami and his lieutenants have helped it buy shares in buzzy companies like SpaceX, Waymo, Klarna, Brex, Chime, pharmaceuticals company Recursion and AI infrastructure company Crusoe Energy Systems, among others. Mubadala Capital, the VC and private equity arm of the sovereign wealth fund, oversees a $24 billion pool of capital with 180 employees spread across several offices, including in London, New York and San Francisco, which hosts a tech team they first established in 2017. That team typically writes checks between $20 million and $50 million for companies in their Series B to D funding stages. Mubadala is also continuing to plow money into other VC funds. Its portfolio includes Altimeter Capital Management, Greenoaks Capital, Iconiq Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, 8VC, Marcelo Claure\u2019s Bicycle Capital, DCVC, Haun Ventures, Arch Venture Partners, Clocktower Group, Radical Ventures and a handful of emerging managers, like a new $30 million seed fund called Nebular, according to several people familiar with these funds. Some prominent tech investors say Mubadala has helped shake the stereotype of sovereign wealth funds as little more than the writers of blank checks for startups. \u201cMubadala emerged in the leadership pack in such a short period of time,\u201d said Brad Gerstner, Altimeter\u2019s founder. \u201cThey were unknown seven years ago, and there was a view generally held that all sovereign money was passive and nonstrategic.\u201d  More recently, Mubadala has been employing a well-worn Silicon Valley playbook to invest directly in more startups: meeting hundreds of founders, often multiple times, to determine the best choice, Ajami says. Often, the introductions to those founders come from the network of venture capitalists Mubadala has backed. Still, Mubadala has something traditional tech investors do not, the firm\u2019s supporters argue. \u201cSilicon Valley firms have a problem when it comes to global mindset,\u201d said Melissa Guzy, co-founder of Singapore-based VC firm Arbor Ventures. \u201cThey are very narrow-minded. They think everything happens in the U.S. and that it happens in Silicon Valley. That\u2019s not always true.\u201d Mubadala\u2019s ties to oil companies across the Middle East, for instance, has been of use to Crusoe, which powers its AI data centers using waste gas from oil production. Meanwhile, the generative AI boom has helped propel Mubadala and other sovereign wealth funds into the limelight as much-sought-after investors, due to their plentiful cash reserves and the AI startups\u2019 insatiable thirst for cash. Mubadala and Abu Dhabi AI firm G42 recently formed MGX, an AI investment fund expected to eventually manage $100 billion in assets. MGX has been in talks to invest in a new Sam Altman\u2013led chip business, the Financial Times reported. \u201cAbu Dhabi is going from a place that was the last call to now the first call,\u201d said Steve Drobny, founder of alternative asset manager Clocktower and a co-host of the recent desert shindig, adding that \u201cIbrahim is squarely in the Silicon Valley inner circle.\u201d \u201cIf you think about the three fundamental pillars of what\u2019s happening in technologies like energy, infrastructure and intelligence\u2014we are at the center of energy, and we have an opportunity to become the center of infrastructure and intelligence,\u201d Ajami said. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where we can really cement ourselves as leaders in this industry.\u201d \u2018Super Entrepreneurial\u2019 Ajami\u2019s interest in the tech business started in 1996, when he saw Marc Andreessen on the cover of Time magazine seated on a throne under the banner \u201cThe Golden Geeks.\u201d Andreessen\u2019s web browser company, Netscape, had gone public the year prior, making him an \u201cinstantaire,\u201d Time wrote. After graduating from Northeastern University in 1999, the Lebanese-born, Abu Dhabi\u2013raised Ajami made a beeline to Silicon Valley. He spent two years working in tech, including for the now-defunct electronics company Packard Bell NEC, while devouring pages of the business magazine Fast Company. In 2004, after completing his master\u2019s in business at the University of Southern California, he headed back home to Abu Dhabi. Two years later, he joined Mubadala shortly after the UAE government formed it to generate returns from the country\u2019s petro fortunes while reducing its reliance on oil by developing other parts of its economy. He worked in a variety of roles, including as a key figure in the formation of GlobalFoundries, a chip manufacturer Mubadala and semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices formed in 2009. A few years later, in 2017, Mubadala put Ajami in charge of opening an office in San Francisco to spearhead an effort to do more tech investing. He was eager to do it, despite the grueling flights he made from Abu Dhabi to San Francisco at least once a month. To manage the long travel days, he consumed a regimen of organic green tea, almonds, melatonin and magnesium citrate. During their first year on the ground in San Francisco, he and a small team based there scouted for investments from unglamorous surroundings: a downtown WeWork office on Montgomery Street. Their conference rooms were so tightly packed that Ajami, Alaa Halawa, head of Mubadala\u2019s healthcare investing, and Ayman AlAbdallah, another early partner, knocked knees when sitting in them. Their printer broke often, founders\u2019 dogs crowded the office and startup employees sharing the space with Mubadala would strike an ear-piercing gong every time they made a sale. \u201cIt was frankly super entrepreneurial,\u201d said AlAbdallah. \u201cIt served us very well.\u201d As they tried to crack into the elite networks of tech and VC, the Mubadala crew embraced a scrappy mindset similar to that of the startup founders around them. Ajami once crashed an invite-only event in downtown Los Angeles in hopes of mingling with attendees, including venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya. After groveling to the host of the party, he was eventually allowed in. \u201cEvery single one of us is just a very ambitious individual,\u201d said Mubadala partner Shaun Lee. As a prelude to gaining direct access to companies, Mubadala first got its foot in the door with VC firms; it has invested in about 30 of them since 2017. In 2022, Ajami met Sebastian Siemiatkowski, a co-founder and the CEO of Swedish fintech company Klarna, through Marc Stad, founder of Dragoneer Investment Group and an early Klarna investor (Mubadala had invested in a Dragoneer fund). Later, in July 2022, that connection led to Mubadala\u2019s direct investment in Klarna after the startup dramatically reset its valuation from $45 billion to $6.7 billion amid a broad downturn in stocks. That allowed Mubadala to get a piece of the fintech at a more attractive price. It wrote a $150 million check as part of the $800 million round. Similarly, another VC firm Mubadala had invested in, DCVC, introduced Halawa to Chris Gibson, a co-founder and the CEO of Recursion. The pharmaceutical company had struggled to attract established Sand Hill Road investors, just as Mubadala was trying to establish its credibility in tech. The two parties took a gamble on each other. In late 2017, Recursion raised money from Mubadala at a valuation of $268 million. In 2021, Recursion went public at a valuation of $5 billion. \u201cWe were building something that was new enough and different enough that, frankly, we weren\u2019t palatable to the best funds,\u201d said Gibson, adding that investors were turned off by the company\u2019s decision to headquarter in Salt Lake City rather than the San Francisco Bay Area. \u201cWe found investors that were less constrained by that dogma.\u201d Missteps It hasn\u2019t always been smooth for Mubadala as it has tried to build a name for itself in tech. One of Ajami\u2019s first deals in Silicon Valley was leading a $60 million investment in San Francisco\u2013based logistics company Turvo in 2018. The next year, Ajami and other board members accused the CEO, Eric Gilmore, of spending over $75,000 in company funds at strip clubs, according to a lawsuit Gilmore filed against Turvo, in which he accused the Turvo board of not following proper procedure when they fired him in 2019. Even before the board made its discovery, Ajami said, he had developed misgivings about Gilmore. \u201cThat was a mistake,\u201d Ajami said. \u201cThere was something in my gut that just didn\u2019t feel right.\u201d Gilmore didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. In another early black eye, in 2017, Mubadala contributed $15 billion to Vision Fund, the gargantuan SoftBank fund that came to be associated with some of the biggest flameouts of the past decade, including WeWork and construction startup Katerra. More recently, it's been trying to sell off or turn around several lackluster European investments. Among them are electric scooter company Tier, which recently merged with another scooter company, Dott, in a deal that the Mubadala partner Elliott influenced, according to a person who spoke to Elliott. Another is Huboo, a fulfillment service for e-commerce companies, which Mubadala first backed in 2021 at a $420 million valuation, according to PitchBook. The company has since raised funds at a much lower valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter. Earlier this year, Huboo\u2019s CEO stepped down. In some cases, Mubadala has clashed with the leaders of its European startups, who have then left their companies. For example, it is trying to sell the core assets of Wefox, a European insurance company that Mubadala valued at $4.5 billion in 2022, to The Ardonagh Group at a price under $600 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. Wefox\u2019s founders and some earlier investors are against the sale, the person said. Ardonagh is backed by another Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. In March, Wefox co-founder and CEO Julian Teicke stepped down. Ajami is on Wefox\u2019s board of directors. \u201cTo frame our tactics as aggressive is a mischaracterization,\u201d Ajami said in an emailed statement. \u201cIf aggressive means trying to make businesses stronger and more efficient by rolling up our sleeves, driving restructuring to improve profitability and long-term business success\u2014then we have a different view on the term aggressive.\u201d The sovereign wealth fund has also butted heads with the management of the Turkish delivery company Getir over its direction, according to Bloomberg, which earlier reported on Mubadala\u2019s efforts to revive Wefox. Getir investors are expected to vote soon on a new board; it\u2019s possible Getir CEO Nazim Salur will be removed from his position soon after, per Bloomberg. Getir didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Mubadala didn\u2019t comment directly on its relationship with the company. Even one of the VC funds Mubadala chose to back hasn\u2019t gone as planned: Stride VC founder Fred Destin said late last year that his London-based firm had paused fundraising for its next fund. Another challenge was the unease of some founders with raising money from Middle Eastern sovereign funds due to the region's autocratic regimes, according to several investors. Those concerns reached a fever pitch in 2018 after the Saudi Arabian government\u2019s 2018 killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Ajami said the Khashoggi affair didn\u2019t cause any issues for Mubadala. \u201cPeople knew that we were [representing] the UAE. I think it was quite distinctly different,\u201d he said. Founders that have raised money from Mubadala agree. \u201cPeople sometimes broadly paint the Middle East with a single brush,\u201d said Crusoe co-founder and CEO Chase Lochmiller. A bigger issue for Mubadala, Ajami said, has been combatting the notion that it\u2019s a passive purveyor of funding. Mubadala has worked hard to alter the \u201cperspective about sovereign wealth funds that we\u2019re just slow and bureaucratic,\u201d Ajami said. They\u2019ve also reiterated to founders their preference for investing earlier rather than writing giant checks just before an exit. \u201cIt\u2019s an uphill battle to educate the market,\u201d said Mubadala\u2019s Lee. Homegrown Mubadala has moved up, in more ways than one, from its days of sharing a WeWork space. Today, it operates out of an office on the 55th floor of the Salesforce Tower with floor-to-ceiling windows and sweeping views of San Francisco. Although Ajami frequently visits the San Francisco office, he spends most of his time in London and Abu Dhabi. While most sovereign wealth fund investors tend to keep a low public profile, Ajami has become a power user of X, the service previously known as Twitter, where he frequently posts his thoughts on everything from his appearance at an event hosted by Calacanis to lines of poetry from Rumi, the 13th-century Sufi mystic. \u201cBeing in the Bay Area just means I need to level up\u2014every single time,\u201d he wrote in one X post in early June. Mubadala\u2019s partners also say it\u2019s easier for them to gain access to the best deals now that many in tech have heard of the firm (even though many continue to mispronounce its name). It hasn\u2019t hurt that diplomatic ties between the U.S. and the UAE have grown tighter over the years, say investors. As tensions with China intensify, concerns among U.S. political and business leaders over the human rights records of Gulf countries have taken a back seat, they say. \u201cThere is an accelerating view that the GCC\u2014the gulf countries, inclusive of the UAE and Saudi\u2014are on the side of modernity,\u201d said Altimeter\u2019s Gerstner, who pointed to those governments\u2019 recent support of Israel as a factor that may have increased the willingness of U.S. investors to accept capital from the region. One other factor: Raising money from pension funds, university endowments and other limited partners in the U.S. has gotten far more challenging for VCs over the past two years, leading many of them to cut the size of their funds. Even some tech investors who have long avoided raising money from the Middle East based on their concerns about the region\u2019s autocratic regimes are changing their tune. In the case of Lux Capital\u2019s Wolfe, he said his March trip to the Mubadala event in the UAE changed his perspective, and he would now welcome Middle Eastern investors as limited partners. \u201cWhen you have this mix of talent, tech, capital and trust, the most important currency, you have the recipe to become a major tech mecca,\u201d Wolfe said. A spokesperson for Lux said the firm hadn\u2019t raised money from \u201csovereign wealth funds in the past because we\u2019ve always had oversubscribed funds from U.S. institutional LPs,\u201d adding that if it were to raise money from sovereign funds, that would depend on whether they are a \u201cstrategic ally and have good diplomatic standing with the U.S.\u201d Some U.S. investors say they prefer working with Mubadala over its biggest competitor in the Middle East\u2014Saudi Arabia\u2019s $900 billion sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund\u2014because Mubadala doesn\u2019t put as much pressure on venture capitalists and founders to invest in the UAE. The Information has previously reported that PIF has asked founders and investors to establish a presence in Riyadh or to invest in companies based there in exchange for funding. A PIF spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Instead, Mubadala has taken more of a carrot approach, rather than brandishing a stick, to attract outsiders to investment in Abu Dhabi. In late May, Ajami arranged a spontaneous dinner in Abu Dhabi\u2019s Al Maryah Island at Cafe Milano, a restaurant inside the Four Seasons Hotel, to help sell a cryptocurrency founder on domiciling their business there. Al Maryah Island is home to Abu Dhabi Global Market, a financial free zone established in 2015 to attract foreign investment. The artificial island has aspirations of becoming a mini Silicon Valley. It\u2019s home to Hub71, a Mubadala-backed startup accelerator Ajami helped create; the Rosewood Abu Dhabi, a sibling hotel to the Sand Hill Road location where venture capitalists frequently cut deals; and a branch of Barry\u2019s Bootcamp, the fitness franchise favored by San Francisco techies. A range of tech celebrities has been sighted there recently, including WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann and Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong. At the May dinner, crypto investor Katie Haun, founder of Haun Ventures and a former Andreessen Horowitz general partner, discussed the benefits of starting a crypto company in Abu Dhabi with representatives of the UAE government, local founders and investors. \u201cIn the face of the regulatory uncertainty, some founders even in the U.S. are looking for other global hubs,\u201d explained Haun. \u201cOne of the things that I think a lot of folks don\u2019t realize is that the UAE is a rather young country.\u2026It\u2019s very digitally forward.\u201d Now that getting American techies to venture onto Abu Dhabi soil poses less of a challenge, a priority for Mubadala is proving its competitiveness with the top VC firms. \u201cFrom a look and feel, it was very important not to just be perceived as channeling sovereign money,\u201d said Mubadala\u2019s Halawa. \u201cWe can stand on our own two feet and deliver what other firms can deliver in Silicon Valley.\u201d Kate Clark is deputy bureau chief responsible for venture capital coverage at The Information.

        "heading": "The Electric: One Creditor Stands Above Others in Fisker\u2019s Bankruptcy",
        "author_name": "Steve LeVine",
        "publish_date": "Jun 20, 2024, 4:30am PDT",
        "body_content": "Its cash reserves dwindling, electric vehicle maker Fisker last year obtained $510 million in funding from Heights Capital Management, a San Francisco\u2013based investor in distressed assets. But when Fisker missed a November deadline for a securities filing, Heights gained the rights to all the company\u2019s assets. Fisker filed for bankruptcy protection late Monday and said it plans to sell its equipment, patents and unsold new EVs. Much of the proceeds will go to Heights, a unit of Susquehanna International Group, which is also an investor in China\u2019s ByteDance, parent of TikTok. Fisker reported nearly $1 billion in inventory, property and equipment as of Dec. 31, 2023, its most recent securities filing.  The bankruptcy petition is the latest by Western EV and battery makers amid an industry slowdown and a reckoning among investors who have soured on the sector. It also underscores the value of raising cash when you can\u2014and the perils of raising it when you, and the industry as a whole, are already in trouble.  Among EV developers, Electric Last Mile Solutions, Lordstown Motors and Proterra have closed or declared bankruptcy; so too has battery developer Ionic Materials. Others are teetering, including Michigan battery maker Our Next Energy, which has been in turmoil since last December, when a big investor withdrew from a Series C fundraise.  A Fisker spokesperson said the company had no comment beyond its press release, but would post more documents on its claims agent\u2019s website in the coming days. Heights investment manager Martin Kobinger did not respond to an email. Fisker went public in October 2020 amid wild enthusiasm for EV makers, raising $1 billion in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company at a valuation of $2.9 billion. Its shares peaked at $28.50 in February 2021 when it struck a tentative deal for its EVs to be manufactured by Foxconn Technology Group, which assembles the iPhone for Apple. But investors soon began to lose their fervor for the industry, not long after Fisker introduced the Ocean, its first EV, which it hoped would compete with Tesla\u2019s Model Y crossover SUV. With 20/20 hindsight, Fisker should have begun raising a bundle of cash in the early months of 2022. It had more than $700 million in cash on hand and orders for 65,000 Oceans, which might have seemed like a lot, especially since the company did not have to spend billions to build factories and was instead farming out the manufacturing of its EVs. But it was spending heavily to develop its future EVs and to keep inventory, and it burned through $650 million, half its cash pile, in 2022.  In 2023, delivery and sales of the Ocean were slower than expected\u2014Fisker delivered just 4,929, an eighth of its original projection for the year. Halfway through 2023, the company had just $522 million in cash and needed to raise more. But by then, the EV slowdown was palpable, and investor interest in money-losing EV companies had waned along with it. By September, Fisker had signed for $510 million in two convertible notes with Heights Capital; after fees, Fisker reaped a much-needed $450 million in cash. But just two months later, the deal looked much less attractive: Under a chaotic management in which two chief accountants left in quick succession, the company was late filing its third-quarter earnings, blaming \u201cmaterial weakness in internal controls,\u201d among other failings. Heights agreed not to force a default, as it could have, which would have required Fisker to repay the full $510 million. But it still came down hard\u2014in a negotiated agreement, Heights forced Fisker to secure the debt with \u201call of the existing and future assets of the company.\u201d The reprieve didn\u2019t seem to matter. In February, Fisker issued a \u201cgoing concern\u201d warning that it might not survive the year, and its share price plunged 35%. Heights began to convert its debt to shares and sell them in the open market, eventually reaching about $330 million in sales, according to a calculation by Bloomberg. With the dilution, Fisker\u2019s shares plunged in price. In March, the company seemed on the verge of obtaining a miraculous investment by Nissan, which had fallen behind in the EV game, but that last hope fell through, in part over concern about Fisker\u2019s arrangement with Heights, according to a former Fisker executive. Late in March, Fisker missed an interest payment to Heights. Its share price was now 9 cents, and the New York Stock Exchange delisted the company. On Monday, Fisker filed with the federal bankruptcy court in Delaware for protection from its creditors while it reorganizes. But there is likely to be no escape from Heights.

        "heading": "Stability AI Gets New CEO and a Bailout From Investor Group Led By Sean Parker",
        "author_name": "Stephanie Palazzolo",
        "publish_date": "Jun 21, 2024, 11:39am PDT",
        "body_content": "Stability AI, a startup that rode the boom in generative artificial intelligence to a $1 billion valuation before experiencing financial trouble and employee defections, has a new CEO. Prem Akkaraju, former CEO of visual effects company Weta Digital, will step into the role, according to a person involved in the decision. The 51-year-old Akkaraju is part of a group of investors including former Facebook President Sean Parker that has stepped in to save Stability with a cash infusion that could result in a lower valuation for the firm, which develops products that use Stable Diffusion, an open-source AI image generator. The new funding will likely shrink the stakes of some existing investors, who have collectively contributed more than $100 million. Parker, who is better known for co-founding Napster, will also join Stability as chairman of its board of directors, said the person who was involved. A Stability spokesperson declined to comment. The new funding is likely a welcome sight for a company that generated less than $5 million in revenue and lost more than $30 million in the first quarter. Stability also currently owes close to $100 million in outstanding bills to cloud computing providers and others. Stability sells memberships to customers to use image-generating models for commercial purposes, such as to create digital ads. The new executives could theoretically give the embattled startup stronger ties to media and entertainment companies that might purchase its image and video-generating software. The U.K.-based Stability became a well-known brand within the generative AI industry even before OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022. Stability leveraged its brand to strike a partnership that year with Amazon Web Services to help sell its AI image product to cloud customers, though the competition in that field has intensified since then. In February, Stability sold off its image creation and editing tool Clipdrop to Jasper, another early riser in generative AI whose growth slowed due to competition from ChatGPT. And in March, Stability\u2019s first CEO, Emad Mostaque, stepped down after facing questions about his claims about the startup\u2019s technology, his management of the company, and his professional background. The startup has around 170 employees, according to LinkedIn. Company executives have told potential buyers in the past that Stability has between 70 and 90 researchers and engineers that would be valuable to a buyer. By taking new money from the investor group involving Parker and Akkaraju, Stability is restructuring its cap table, otherwise known as a recapitalization, according to the person who is involved. Investors who lead a recapitalization typically get preferential terms, such as the right to get money back before other investors in the event of a sale or liquidation. And the new investors often get a substantial stake because they put in capital after lowering the company\u2019s valuation. As a result, existing investors\u2019 stakes fall in value and may shrink substantially on a percentage basis if they don\u2019t contribute more capital. It isn\u2019t clear if any existing investors will put in more capital, but none of them are selling their stakes as part of the recapitalization, the person said. Before Parker and Akkaraju\u2019s group stepped in, Stability had raised at least $101 million from investors including Coatue Management and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

        "heading": "Apple Suspends Work on Next Vision Pro, Focused on Releasing Cheaper Model in Late 2025",
        "author_name": "Wayne Ma",
        "publish_date": "Jun 18, 2024, 8:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "Apple has told at least one supplier that it has suspended work on its next high-end Vision headset, an employee at a manufacturer that makes key components for the Vision Pro said. The pullback comes as analysts and supply chain partners have flagged slowing sales of the $3,500 device. The company is still working on releasing a more affordable Vision product with fewer features before the end of 2025, the person involved in its supply chain and a person involved in the manufacturing of the headsets said. Apple originally planned to divide its Vision line into two models, similar to the standard and Pro versions of the iPhone, according to people involved in its supply chain and former Apple employees who worked on the devices. Apple\u2019s decision to halt work on the next version of its high-end headset is the latest example of the company reshuffling priorities. Apple has ramped up work on AI-powered features while paring back money-losing projects like its self-driving car, which it canceled earlier this year after spending nearly a decade on development. Augmented reality is one of Apple\u2019s biggest bets. The company aims to eventually replace the iPhone with lightweight glasses, and the Vision Pro is the first step in building consumer and developer interest in that effort. Although it\u2019s possible that Apple could resume work on a high-end Vision product down the road, suspending development of the next high-end headset for now could have repercussions for the rest of the AR and virtual reality industry, which views the headset as a litmus test of consumer appetite for a premium device. Meta Platforms, for instance, started work in November on a new high-end headset, internally code-named La Jolla, according to multiple current and former Meta employees, five months after Apple announced the Vision Pro. Before that, in January 2023, Meta had axed plans to build a more expensive Quest headset after it saw weak sales of its $1,500 Quest Pro. A Meta spokesperson didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. After the Vision Pro\u2019s U.S. launch in February, independent reviewers criticized its lack of content, poor comfort and limited use cases, while bloggers and columnists have flagged examples of owners that have stopped using the device because of these issues. The device is set for an international launch in countries including China, Japan, Australia and major European countries at the end of June, and Apple earlier this month announced a new version of the Vision Pro operating system to address user complaints and rejuvenate interest in the device. Even with a looming international launch, one supplier that makes components for the Vision Pro cut production by half in May after receiving a forecast from Apple predicting weaker demand through August. The supplier, which has no competitors, made parts for about 460,000 Vision Pros as of April, one of its employees said, and planned to make enough parts for another 100,000 headsets between May and August. The numbers suggest that Apple has at most produced about half a million units this year and doesn\u2019t expect to make significantly more than that through August. Apple had been deprioritizing the successor to the high-end Vision Pro for the past year, over time assigning fewer employees to work on the second-generation model, according to one person who worked on the device until earlier this year. Within Apple, the focus last year shifted to reducing the cost of the first-generation model\u2019s components, although development did start on an upgraded Vision Pro display, the person said. Cutting Costs, Shedding Weight Apple began work in 2022 on a cheaper Vision product, internally code-named N109, The Information previously reported. The company\u2019s aim is to make this version as affordable as a high-end iPhone, which retails for up to $1,600. At the time it started the work, Apple aimed to release the more affordable product at the end of 2024. As of earlier this year, Apple still didn\u2019t have a firm prototype of N109, according to a person involved in its manufacturing. And the company has been struggling to find ways to cut the model\u2019s cost without losing too many key features, which means the product could likely slip beyond its revised release date for the end of 2025. One issue is that Apple wants the more affordable model to keep the Vision Pro\u2019s ultra-high-end displays, which are among the most expensive components in the device, according to the person who worked on it and the people involved in its manufacturing and supply chain. Apple had been working with a Chinese company, Seeya Technology, to produce cheaper displays by next year that could supplant those of Sony, which until now has been the sole supplier of displays for the Vision Pro, those three people said. The person involved in its manufacturing said Seeya has so far struggled to meet Apple\u2019s standards and the effort might fail. MacRumors reported on some of the cheaper model\u2019s features last year, saying it would keep its high-end displays but include fewer cameras, a simpler headband and smaller speakers. Apple is also trying to make N109 at least one-third lighter than the Vision Pro, according to the person involved in its supply chain. Some users have complained that the Vision Pro, which can weigh as much as 650 grams or 1.43 pounds, is too heavy to wear comfortably for long periods of time.

        "author_name": "Brigid Mander",
        "publish_date": "Jun 22, 2024, 6:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "Modern technology is everywhere, often in various forms of screen time. That makes it a popular scapegoat for the increasing, collective loss of our human connection to the natural world. It\u2019s not just that time spent using technology has replaced time in nature, it\u2019s also that for many nature is farther away: Over half the world\u2019s population now lives in urban settings, a figure that rises to around 80% in high-income regions such as North America, Japan and Western Europe. As this disconnect from nature spreads, we are also learning that spending time in nature is integral to our overall health and happiness. Studies have shown that even simple acts like a walk in a city park and observing birds and wildlife provide a greater sense of connection and well-being. Luckily, on the flip side of our world of modern technology are incredible tech-driven programs that can help bridge this disconnect. When Sean Taylor, chief scientist at Motif Analytics, a data startup, wants to venture outside and away from his West Oakland home, he reaches for AllTrails. (The app has lately seen its popularity greatly expand past its cult following\u2014so much so that Apple has recently moved to copy-cat it.) \u201cIf I want to find a beautiful place to walk or hike, there are so many options with tons of details, photos, and reviews,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cWithout AllTrails, I'd probably never overcome the activation energy to get to some of these places.\u201d Natalie Down, an environment technology and communications consultant who lives in Half Moon Bay, Calif., enjoys the Merlin Bird ID app from Cornell University, which lives up to its namesake, she said. \u201cOne of the things I love about Merlin was the ability to have it on in the background, listen to the birds and then magically \u2026 watch the app identify the birds.\u201d Beside enriching lives one at a time, conservationists hope some of these apps will move people to care about the natural habitats of plants and animals and how they enrich our own lives. After all, it usually holds true that what\u2019s good for us and what\u2019s good for the rest of nature are the same thing. This app from Cornell University\u2019s Lab of Ornithology can identify over 10,000 species of birds by image or by birdsong. Users can download a bird data pack for their home area or a travel location for the most accurate identifications; you can also enter photos or record sounds in the app. Each sound or image presented brings up information like name, habitat, migration range and other interesting facts about the birds, which you can save in a \u201clife list.\u201d (Recently, the app helped me confirm a bird near our house in Wyoming as a northern flicker, a type of woodpecker with beautiful, leopard-like coloring, as well as identify the melodious song of the Western meadowlark in a sagebrush meadow.) User data from citizen scientists helps Cornell and other researchers around the world monitor birds for habitat conservation and policy recommendations. All in all, it\u2019s a comprehensive, well-designed app. It\u2019s an easy and delightful way to enrich your daily life and engage children with these little ambassadors of nature, whether on vacation in Costa Rica or peering into the branches of a sidewalk tree on Manhattan\u2019s West Side Highway. (Free) There\u2019s a reason AllTrails is one of the most popular apps for finding the perfect trail for running, hiking, cycling, or pushing a stroller\u2014just about anywhere. You can filter by location and difficulty (easy, moderate, hard), so you aren\u2019t wasting time or feeling apprehensive about over- or under-committing yourself. As a search engine, it accesses hundreds of thousands of trails around the globe with images, difficulty ratings, whether dogs are allowed and reviews from fellow trail users (but in-house AllTrails experts vet public input to maintain the app\u2019s reliability). Many users such as Shobeir Shobeiri, a senior director at Mintegral, an ad tech outfit, use AllTrails to filter allowed trail uses. \u201cI use AllTrails because I love finding dog-friendly trails,\u201d said Shobeiri, of Sonoma, Calif., who says it\u2019s a great way to find beach outings and other walks where he and his pooch are welcomed. The free version is great and offers all the basic trail information and route recording features. The paid version allows you to download maps for offline use, track your route with wrong turn alerts and access its National Park guides. (A basic free version and a premium version at $35.99 annually.) OnX offers comprehensive geospatial mapping for various types of outdoor activities, including hunting, off-roading, hiking and rock climbing. It benefits from a well-designed\u2014and quite user-friendly\u2014app interface that makes it a pleasure to explore its comprehensive terrain and land ownership maps, which allow you to plan routes and understand public land rules; you\u2019ll know if your routes run through a national forest, federal wilderness or even private land. OnX also includes important reminders such as notifications about critical wintering wildlife areas, which are seasonally closed to human use on otherwise public land\u2014a great reminder to respect our fellow creatures out there. (Later this year, you can use OnX\u2019s winter mode, in which you\u2019ll find popular resort ski runs as well as backcountry trailheads\u2014known ascent and descent routes\u2014with slope angles, past avalanche events and runout zones to avoid.) Download offline maps for areas with spotty or no cell service. (A free basic version, as well as a $9 premium and $30 elite version.) This nature identification app is a wonderful tool for families and children. It highlights the natural world\u2019s existence in even the most urban spots\u2014including the tiniest forms of flora or fauna. See a funny mushroom or moss growing next to a patio? Or a little frog at a pond? The app uses your phone\u2019s camera with image recognition technology and data from iNaturalist, the California Academy of Sciences and National Geographic to analyze images and identify amphibians, fungi, wildlife and plants. The information collected when using Seek is not shared with the public, making it an ideal app for kids to use. My only warning: The app tends to be so fascinating, your average moving speed is likely to plummet. (Free) Stargazing has been a font of wonder, storytelling and mythology for humans for millennia. Even though many people now live in cities where light pollution dims or obscures the twinkling celestial bodies that awed our ancestors, we know more about them than ever. Two straightforward apps offer great tools for beginner astronomers of all ages. Night Sky is an excellent option for iOS users. Point your phone at the sky, and the app fills in details about the constellations and galaxies above. It has an augmented reality feature that offers labels you can tap on for information about what\u2019s above, and that can adjust for light pollution. The app works on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Vision Pro (you may remember it appeared on a list of our favorite Vision Pro apps).($5.99 a month or $39.99 annually.) Also consider Stellarium, which works with iOS and Android (with a free version, as well as a $19.99 premium version), and offers amateur stargazers an impressively comprehensive catalog of objects in the night sky with an easy-to-use interface.

        "heading": "OpenAI\u2019s Japanese Rival Gets $1 Billion Valuation From Silicon Valley Investors",
        "author_name": "Stephanie Palazzolo",
        "publish_date": "Jun 14, 2024, 11:51am PDT",
        "body_content": "In their hunt for artificial intelligence investments, U.S. venture capitalists are looking past Silicon Valley at foreign AI startups, betting that locally developed large-language models will outperform imports from the U.S. The latest to win their affections is Sakana AI, a Tokyo-based large-language model developer. Founded last year by alumni of Google\u2019s DeepMind, Sakana is raising around $100 million in a new financing co-led by New Enterprise Associates and existing investors Lux Capital and Khosla Ventures, according to three people with direct knowledge of the deal. The round values the company, which does not yet generate revenue, at approximately $1 billion, the people said. The funding has not closed and the terms could change. Sakana cofounders David Ha and Llion Jones did not respond to a request for comment. Sakana\u2019s new funding comes on the heels of a breakthrough announced in March, when it released research showing how to develop large-language models for less money, as well as an LLM that solves math problems in Japanese and models that can generate and understand images and text in Japanese. It has released some of its models as open-source software, but not a product that consumers can access similar to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. It\u2019s still unclear how the company will make money. U.S. AI developers are already establishing a presence in Japan. In April, OpenAI announced that it opened up an office in Tokyo as a way to expand Asia operations. It also hired Tadao Nagasaki as president of OpenAI Japan and gave local businesses access to a model that is optimized for the Japanese language. The new funding for Sakana comes amid a rash of investment interest for AI startups developing models focused on specific geographies. Earlier this month, the Paris-based AI startup Mistral, which has styled itself as the \u201cOpenAI of Europe,\u201d raised $650 million at a $6 billion valuation from U.S. investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and General Catalyst, for instance. Nikkei Asia earlier reported Sakana was in talks with the U.S. VC investors for a $1 billion round. \u2018DeepMind of Japan\u2019 Sakana was founded last year by Ha and Jones, who co-authored the Google research paper that outlined the transformer model architecture that underlies today\u2019s most popular LLMs like OpenAI\u2019s GPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Ha previously told The Information that he intended to build a \u201cDeepMind of Japan.\u201d \u201cIf we had started Sakana AI in the Bay Area, it would have been a strategic blunder, because we would have looked more like everyone else and it would have been very hard to differentiate,\u201d Ha said. In January, Sakana raised a $30 million seed round led by Lux Capital and included a mix of Japanese investors, including Sony Group and NTT Group as well as Japan-focused venture firms such as Geodesic. The round valued the company at $200 million, according to two of the people with direct knowledge. Sakana also has received a boost from the Japanese government, which chose Sakana as one of a handful of companies and labs to receive grants to gain access to a large amount of computing power. The startup is also part of a growing number of upstarts looking to challenge the traditional transformer architecture. Transformers, which are particularly capital and compute-intensive to train and run, are notorious for producing errors known as hallucinations, which make them difficult to use in high-stakes business settings. Recent research has also suggested that as transformer models get better, they will require increasingly more training data\u2014and, therefore, capital\u2014to eke extra performance out of them. Instead, Sakana is building foundation models inspired by concepts found in nature. (Its name is derived from a Japanese word \u201cmeant to invoke the idea of a school of fish coming together and forming a coherent entity from simple rules,\u201d a reference to the company\u2019s unique approach to building \u201cnature-inspired intelligence.\u201d) For example, the company has experimented with \u201cmodel merging,\u201d in which researchers combine two or more models trained for different purposes to create a single model that exhibits the strengths of the original model without needing additional training\u2014a similar concept to evolution in nature.

        "author_name": "Ann Gehan",
        "publish_date": "Jun 19, 2024, 9:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "Beauty startup investors began this year with high hopes. In December, personal care giant Unilever said it was buying hair care brand K18, a star on TikTok since its 2020 launch. The industry took that as a sign that trendy brands had a fresh shot at selling to big conglomerates, which had mostly paused acquisitions after a deal binge in 2021. At least five beauty startups have hired advisers to explore a sale since the start of the year, four bankers working with sellers told me. But the big buyers have mostly remained cautious, especially regarding young brands without long track records. That has left investors, founders and bankers who gathered at a beauty industry deal conference in New York this week anxious for more deals to materialize. \u201cThings are a little colder,\u201d said Richard Henry, a partner at Sandbridge Capital, which has invested in brands including Ilia Beauty and Youth To The People. And many buyers are still focusing on the brands they shelled out for a few years ago, as opposed to hunting for new deals. \u201cThere\u2019s so much digestion now,\u201d he said. Investors have poured $8 billion into beauty, skin care and hair care startups since 2018, according to PitchBook, and beauty brands have been resilient compared to other consumer startups that struggled once the e-commerce slowdown started in late 2021. Many were able to find customers cheaply using TikTok marketing and celebrity promotion, and then build on that popularity by expanding into stores like Sephora. After a wave of acquisitions by big beauty companies in 2021 and early 2022, beauty dealmaking was fairly quiet until the K18 deal and a handful of other acquisitions, including skin care brands Naturium and Dr. Dennis Gross, announced late last year. K18 stood out for how quickly it was able to go from launch to acquisition, although in general big beauty conglomerates have gotten choosier about paying up for trendy brands. \u201cWe\u2019re not in season one of the beauty M&A game anymore,\u201d said Kevin Kim, a director at investment bank Raymond James, speaking onstage. \u201cI think the lessons learned from earlier seasons are kind of informing buyers, whether they\u2019re private equity, or especially strategics, on what really works and what they want.\u201d Two of the brands that could be in play are Selena Gomez\u2019s four-year-old Rare Beauty and Glossier, a brand backed by Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital and valued at $1.8 billion in 2021. Glossier, founded in 2014, won over tech investors during the direct-to-consumer boom of the 2010s but has been trying to reignite sales growth more recently. The company hired Morgan Stanley to explore options including a sale, Puck and WWD reported in March. And Rare Beauty is reportedly exploring options including a sale. But many of the bankers and investors I spoke to this week were skeptical that either brand would get a deal done anytime soon, mainly because of their hefty price tags and uncertainty around future sales growth. Makeup, known as \u201ccolor\u201d in industry lingo, has also seen waning acquirer interest as a category compared to other beauty products like skin care and hair products, as makeup sales have slowed industrywide and as more big beauty companies are developing their own brands in-house. \u201cThere are fewer buyers today in color,\u201d Sasha Radic, a managing director at Jefferies focused on beauty and wellness deals, said on a panel. \u201cHow do you as a brand show that you are built to last? How are you creating loyalty? How are you driving replenishment?\u201d The multiples buyers are willing to pay have also been shrinking, adding to the hurdles for getting deals done. K18, generally seen as a high-water mark for recent deal activity, sold in December for around $700 million, or around six times its 2023 sales, The Information previously reported. Now sellers will likely need to accept multiples of between four and five times annual sales, bankers and investors said. What Buyers Want Some beauty conglomerates have had to pull back on high-dollar deals after sales of their existing brands started to decline. Est\u00e9e Lauder, for example, has returned its focus to brands it already owns after paying $2.2 billion for skin care company Deciem in 2021 and buying Tom Ford in 2022 in a deal valued at $2.8 billion. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s group president for acquisitions, Carol Hamilton, said the company is taking a more conservative approach to growing its portfolio. \u201cI think it\u2019s like having a child,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cYou really should space them out and take care of them.\u201d Companies are prioritizing smaller deals valued at less than $1 billion, bankers and corporate development executives said. Large strategic buyers are also more focused on acquisitions that can offer a compelling pitch for reliable, long-term sales growth or add capabilities a company doesn\u2019t already have, bankers said. Hamilton, the L\u2019Or\u00e9al executive, said she\u2019s looking to strike the right balance between capturing trends in buzzy products like clinical skin care and adding brands to the company\u2019s lineup that can win over picky customers in the long run for its core hair care and makeup businesses. L\u2019Oreal last year bought body and skin care brand Aesop in a deal valued at $2.5 billion. Hamilton said Aesop, founded in 1987, stood out because of its long track record and because it had nearly 400 bricks-and-mortar stores, something most existing L\u2019Or\u00e9al brands don\u2019t have. \u201cIt gives us a weapon to become better at that,\u201d she said.

        "heading": "Some Advertisers Are Bargain Hunting on X. It May Not Be Enough",
        "author_name": "Erin Woo",
        "publish_date": "Jun 18, 2024, 11:42am PDT",
        "body_content": "Elon Musk\u2019s X, formerly known as Twitter, has lost so many big-name advertisers that it\u2019s starting to look attractive\u2014at least for smaller marketers focused more on luring new customers than burnishing their brand name. But even that may not be enough to turn around X\u2019s much-shrunken ad business. One advertiser who is seeing good results on X is Sean Frank, CEO of wallet maker Ridge, who says ads he has been running on X have generated results similar to those for ads he runs on Meta Platforms\u2019 Instagram and Facebook, albeit on a smaller scale in terms of audience and spending. But when he mentions those results to other advertisers, most aren\u2019t interested. According to Frank, they say the work involved in moving to X\u2019s ad systems isn\u2019t justified given the smaller potential base of customers they can reach compared with Meta\u2019s properties. Frank\u2019s experience encapsulates the dilemma for X and its CEO, Linda Yaccarino, as the ad veteran endeavors to turn around its beleaguered business. A collapse in demand has pushed ad prices on X to bargain-basement levels, opening the doors for price-conscious advertisers more concerned with signing up new customers than with X\u2019s controversial reputation. But with 550 million monthly active users globally, compared to Meta Platform\u2019s roughly 4 billion, X may not have enough scale for even those smaller advertisers. That\u2019s an issue for Yaccarino and Musk, both of whom are appearing this week at the Cannes Lions advertising festival. Once a $4.5 billion a year business, X\u2019s ad revenue fell in the U.S. by more than half in the year after Elon Musk bought the company. Marketers fled in the wake of Musk\u2019s loosening of content moderation restrictions, a situation aggravated by the air of chaos that surrounded X as he laid off more than 75% of its staff. Musk\u2019s hostile comments about advertisers further turned marketers off. More than 500 of Twitter\u2019s top advertisers had stopped spending on the platform by January 2023, and daily revenue had dropped by 40%, The Information reported at the time. Before Musk bought the company, the vast majority of its ad revenue came from brand advertisers. But that part of its business has evaporated. One indication of that is X\u2019s share of national advertising spending, which dropped to 2% among major social media platforms in the year through April 2024, down from 7% the previous year and 12% the year before that, according to Guideline, which collects invoicing data from all major ad-holding companies and other top independent firms. National ad spending on X has dropped 65% since May 2023 compared to the previous year, Guideline reported, despite increases on all other social media platforms tracked. Guideline\u2019s month-by-month data on national advertising show a continued decline after Yaccarino, a longtime head of ad sales at NBCUniversal, joined the company midway through last year. X\u2019s share of ad spending on social media platforms fell from 3.7% in May 2023 to 0.7% in April 2024. \u201cLinda always was very popular, with lots of friends, lots of colleagues and allies in the industry,\u201d said Randall Rothenberg, former CEO of the Interactive Advertising Bureau. \u201cShe was very good at running sales for NBC, but none of that really makes a difference when it comes to large-scale investment decisions by major brands.\u201d Yaccarino has had limited success in bringing back some big-name advertisers. Ad executive Monique Pintarelli told employees last week that 65% of advertisers have returned to the platform, according to a person who attended the meeting. But the Guideline numbers suggest they\u2019re not spending as much as they used to. Yaccarino spoke to employees at meetings last week but didn\u2019t specify the current rate of ad revenue. However, Pintarelli said that \"performance\" advertisers\u2014whose goal is to sell products rather than raise brand awareness\u2014now account for most of X\u2019s ad revenue, according to two people who attended the meeting. (The Verge and The New York Times previously reported on the all-hands meetings.) That\u2019s a hopeful sign. Those kinds of advertisers, primarily small- to medium-size businesses, make up the vast majority of Meta\u2019s advertising, for instance. If X can hold onto those marketers, it would be able to rebuild its ad business. But X is up against powerful incumbents in Meta as well as Google. Those companies have built sophisticated ad-targeting systems and reach billions of monthly active users. X\u2019s ad targeting has historically been much weaker, said Leesha Bush, vice president of digital marketing at the ad agency Outcast. X has gone out of its way to try to lure small advertisers. Over the past year, the company has offered a cornucopia of promotions to lure new advertisers; one current deal offers $500 in ad credit when a brand spends its first $250 on the platform. (The fine print on the offer notes that these credits are not redeemable for cash.) X\u2019s main advantage is that it\u2019s cheap, said Kevin Simonson, who co-founded a marketing agency and now consults for brands, agencies and private equity firms. For his clients, X\u2019s cost per thousand viewers tends to be the lowest among competitors Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok and Snap, but its performance is also the worst. \u201cThe conversation is, \u2018Twitter ads are so cheap right now that I\u2019m going to test it,\u2019\u201d Simonson said. That could mean X\u2019s revenue is less durable, he added. Brand budgets are typically more difficult to score but can lead to larger contracts, Simonson said. Budgets for performance advertisers come and go depending on whether companies are seeing returns on their investment. The flip side is that brand advertisers are more likely to flee when faced with a brand safety risk like Musk\u2019s behavior, whereas performance advertisers just want to sell products. Frank, at the Ridge wallet company, increased his company\u2019s advertising on X this year in the face of inconsistent performance on Meta. Frank estimates that he will spend about $5 million on X this year, representing roughly 5% of his advertising budget\u2014still a small enough amount that he lumps X in with Snap, Reddit, TikTok and TV ads as a \u201ctertiary network,\u201d not a primary ad outlet. But, Frank said, none of Musk\u2019s behavior has given him pause thus far. \u201cWe never thought about pausing advertising because of that,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI would pull advertising if results went down.\u201d Erin Woo is a San Francisco-based reporter covering Twitter, TikTok and Snap for The Information.

        "body_content": "Call me crazy, but a product that has to carry a health warning label seems like it might have a bit of a problem attracting customers. And yet that\u2019s the situation social media platforms\u2014such as Meta Platforms\u2019 Instagram and Facebook, Snap\u2019s Snapchat and TikTok\u2014 might be in if the surgeon general has his way. As he opined in this New York Times op-ed on Monday, labels need to state that \u201csocial media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents.\u201d While TikTok has bigger problems\u2014it might be banned in the U.S. before this warning label ever comes about\u2014the idea isn\u2019t good news for Meta or Snap. And yet both companies\u2019 stocks rose on Monday. In other words, investors don\u2019t care. That\u2019s probably a mistake. Yes, the danger social media poses to young people is a constant theme in the news media and in Washington. (Remember that Senate hearing from January, when Sen. Josh Hawley excoriated Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg over this issue? Under prompting from Hawley, Zuckerberg stood up and apologized to parents in the hearing room whose families had been affected by online abuse of some kind.) This issue crops up in the news so often\u2014such as this expos\u00e9 published by The Wall Street Journal over the weekend\u2014that investors can be forgiven if they tune it out. But the surgeon general\u2019s op-ed is the latest sign that something will eventually happen to force social media platforms to take action. A couple of weeks ago, the New York state legislature passed a bill requiring social media to \u201crestrict addictive feeds on their platforms for users under 18.\u201d A similar bill is working its way through the California legislature. Various proposals are before Congress, and they have bipartisan support. And yet the response from Meta, the biggest social media platform, is to pass the buck. The owner of Facebook and Instagram put out a blog post last November acknowledging the challenges that parents face\u2014and suggesting that Congress regulate the app stores, requiring them to get parental approval when under\u201316-year-olds download apps. Good one\u2014push this onto Apple and Google!  To be fair, the best way to solve this issue may involve both the app stores and the social media platforms. But Meta executives need to take some responsibility. The coverage on this issue makes Meta\u2019s properties in particular look like a haven of truly disturbing content for teenagers and kids. How long can Silicon Valley ignore this issue? You can almost hear the baying of the hounds\u2014also known as reporters\u2014at The Washington Post and The New York Times, who smell blood in the drama surrounding Post CEO Will Lewis and his incoming editor, Robert Winnett. Both publications have been aggressively reporting on the alleged misdeeds of the two British journalists a decade or two ago, in incidents involving phone hacking. You get the sense the newspapers won\u2019t give up until Lewis steps down and Winnett backs away from taking the Post job. The Post reporters, at least, should be careful what they wish for. Post owner Jeff Bezos may not care about the negative publicity (it\u2019s not clear too many people outside journalism do). But there is always the possibility that he does\u2014and that he decides this drama (on top of The Post\u2019s losses) is too much for him. Just imagine the consternation if reporters at The Post wake up one day to discover the paper has been sold\u2014to someone much less to their taste than Bezos, someone willing to put in an even more unsavory CEO! Suddenly the questionable ethics of British journalists might not look quite so outrageous.

        "publish_date": "Jun 20, 2024, 4:08pm PDT",
        "body_content": "Cerebras, a developer of artificial intelligence chips that\u2019s trying to wrestle business from Nvidia, has filed confidentially with securities regulators for an initial public offering, according to a person involved in the decision. The startup has also notified Delaware, the state in which it is incorporated, that it is creating preferred shares priced at a deep discount to its last private funding round. The move could make its shares more attractive to private investors ahead of an IPO and those who participate in the public listing. The IPO plans show the eight-year-old company wants to ride a wave of investor enthusiasm over AI hardware sales that have made Nvidia the world\u2019s most valuable company and boosted scores of other stocks. Cerebras will need to show how it plans to get a piece of the market for AI server chips and loosen Nvidia\u2019s grip on it. The startup\u2019s financial results couldn\u2019t be learned. It said in a blog post in December that it had recently reached \u201ccash flow break-even,\u201d without elaborating. Cerebras declined to comment. In early June, Cerebras authorized a share price of $14.66 for around 27 million of new shares, according to a filing shared by Prime Unicorn Index. That is sharply lower than the $27.74 share price from its 2021 Series F funding round that valued it at over $4 billion. The new share authorization suggests Cerebras is valuing itself at around $2.5 billion. It\u2019s not clear whether Cerebras has officially sold the shares or who will own them. It's common for companies to raise capital ahead of an IPO, sometimes to shore up their balance sheet before public investors consider buying the stock. Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., Cerebras previously raised $720 million from investors including Coatue Management, Benchmark and G42, an Abu Dhabi tech conglomerate that has enlisted Cerebras to build three supercomputers for it. Cerebras has hired Citigroup to be the lead bank on its initial public offering, Bloomberg reported in April. Cerebras, founded in 2016, is one of a handful of startups looking to take on Nvidia. The startup offers a chip specialized for training AI models, and has worked with organizations like the Abu Dhabi-based Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence and Abu Dhabi healthcare firm M42 to develop conversational AI, known as large language models, in Arabic or tailored to healthcare applications. (Read more in The Information\u2019s AI Chips Database). Aside from competing with Nvidia, chip developers face challenges such as shortages of chip components and ensuring their chips keep pace with the rapid development of AI software. Nvidia has a built-in advantage with AI developers that have gotten used to writing machine-learning apps with Cuda, an Nvidia software that only works with Nvidia chips. In March, Cerebras unveiled its latest chip, the Wafer Scale Engine 3, which the company claims could train an AI model that\u2019s 10 times the size of the industry\u2019s biggest ones, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 or Google\u2019s Gemini. The company says Mayo Clinic and AstraZeneca are among its customers. The AI stock boom led by Nvidia has extended to other new stocks. For instance, shares of Astera Labs, which sells data center components to the likes of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft, jumped as much as 76% in its public market debut in March and have remained above its IPO price. Secondary market investors have valued Cerebras between between $4.2 billion and $5 billion, according to Caplight, which collects data from broker dealers that handle bids for existing shares.

        "author_name": "Kalley Huang",
        "publish_date": "Jun 24, 2024, 7:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "Read through enough contracts, invoices or purchase orders\u2014any business documents, really\u2014enough times, and your eyes probably glaze over. Ondrej Antos experienced it as a law clerk nearly a decade ago.  When Antos met Nischal Nadhamuni at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2016, the pair went on a three-hour-long walk in Cambridge, Mass., and decided to start a company to tackle the problem. Klarity, their startup, began in 2017 by building document review tools for law firms and pivoted in 2020 to target accounting and compliance teams. Its customers now include public companies such as DoorDash, Moody\u2019s and Zoom. Klarity processes data from documents and reconciles that data against internal records using artificial intelligence technology including computer vision, which recognizes visual data such as images. For example, it could check that a vendor spent an agreed-upon amount and then pay that vendor. As a result, fewer people have to manually read through nearly identical documents and look for differences. It\u2019s an example of how companies can use AI for something more useful than a chatbot. Klarity has a head start in this area over other AI startups that are still in alpha, beta or proof-of-concept stages. That has not only helped Klarity with customers, but with investors. The San Francisco-based company has raised $70 million in a Series B round led by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, with participation from Scale Venture Partners, Tola Capital, Picus Capital, Invus Capital and Y Combinator. Antos declined to share its valuation.  \u201cThey\u2019re solving problems that customers have so much pain around, and there's so much opportunity around,\u201d said Sheila Gulati, Tola Capital\u2019s co-founder and a director on Klarity\u2019s board. \u201cThat practicality is where the real change comes from.\u201d Gross is joining Klarity\u2019s board as a director, and Scale partner Rory O\u2019Driscoll is joining as an observer. Friedman and Gross\u2019s backgrounds in enterprise software and AI made them compelling lead investors. So did their Andromeda Cluster of chips for training and running machine-learning models, which startups backed by Friedman and Gross can use for free, Antos said.  The fresh funding will mostly be used to hire new staff, particularly people working on product and go-to-market strategy, Antos said. The company currently has about 130 employees and is on track to triple that number this year. The generative AI boom has spawned models that are better at understanding text and visual information, making Klarity\u2019s platform more advanced and easier for businesses to implement, Antos said. Its integration time has fallen to two to three months from nine. The company uses its own models, as well as those from other developers including Google and OpenAI, to better understand visual data like tables and to learn the quirks of a company\u2019s documents. For the majority of its customers, Klarity processes 85% to 92% of transactions without human involvement, Antos said. He said the firm is faster and more accurate than traditional business processing outsourcers. \u201cImagine that you have to sit and review 100 invoices per day,\u201d Antos said. \u201cWe\u2019re freeing up people from doing that work, and then they can apply their talents to much better things,\u201d like decision-making and creative work. Here\u2019s what else is going on\u2026 Chinese AI unicorn 01.AI has struck a deal to make its large language model available through Fireworks AI, a U.S. startup that helps developers run and tweak AI models, according to a person with knowledge of the two companies\u2019 partnership. This is the latest example of how China\u2019s top AI startups, facing a fierce price war in their home market, are looking for business opportunities in the U.S.    Fireworks AI, based in Redwood City, Calif., provides developers with access to many models, including Meta\u2019s Llama 3 and Stability AI\u2019s Stable Diffusion 3, through an application programming interface. Now, Fireworks is adding to its offerings 01.AI\u2019s closed-source LLM, Yi-Large, which the Chinese company released last month.  Beijing-based 01.AI, founded last year by former Google China president Kai-Fu Lee, is ramping up its efforts to find global customers. Earlier this month, chip giant Nvidia\u2019s NIM service, which provides enterprise customers worldwide with easy access to AI models, added 01.AI\u2019s Yi-Large to its offerings, The Information reported last week.  Chinese AI startups are trying to expand overseas because competitors in China are undercutting each other\u2019s prices for LLMs and applications in what could be a race to the bottom. Moonshot AI, one of 01.AI\u2019s domestic rivals, has quietly launched two products in the U.S., The Information reported last week.\u2014Juro Osawa See The Information\u2019s Generative AI Database for an exclusive list of private companies and their investors. OpenAI acquired Rockset, which builds search and data analytics tools. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Speak, a language learning app, raised $20 million in a Series B extension round led by Buckley Ventures. The startup is now valued at $500 million. New Computer, a startup developing an AI companion app, raised $3.7 million in pre-seed funding from the OpenAI Fund, Lachy Groom, South Park Commons and other investors. OmniAI, which transforms unstructured enterprise data into a format that data analytics apps and AI can understand, raised a $3.2 million seed round led by FundersClub at a $30 million valuation.

        "author_name": "Abram Brown",
        "publish_date": "Jun 22, 2024, 7:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "Welcome, Weekenders! In this newsletter: Wanted! Investors for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shove millions of dollars into a nascent technology during a time of great mania. Must be comfortable accepting the total absence of any business plan and willing to entrust capital to a person best known publicly for a leading role in one of the most dramatic corporate coups in Silicon Valley history. That\u2019s more or less the proposal put out by Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI co-founder who announced his departure from the startup last month. Free as a bird, he\u2019s starting what he calls Safe Superintelligence Inc.  Sutskever envisions Safe Superintelligence as a pure-minded outfit that\u2019ll focus on artificial intelligence research and developing AI systems as safely as possible. (At OpenAI, he clashed with CEO Sam Altman over whether they were taking the necessary precautions as they built tools like ChatGPT and Dall-E.) And to allow Safe Superintelligence to focus on safety, Sutskever says the company has no intention of prioritizing any commercial products. Without revenue, Safe Superintelligence will need some serious outside capital to afford the rising costs around AI development. Who\u2019s putting up the funds? Sutskever won\u2019t talk about investors or how much Safe Superintelligence has raised. Nonetheless, his co-founder, Daniel Gross, insists investors are the least of their concerns. \u201cOut of all the problems we face, raising capital is not going to be one of them,\u201d Gross, a former Apple AI exec, told Bloomberg. I don\u2019t doubt that\u2019s true. Worries about AI have risen to such a level that I can see Safe Superintelligence attracting plenty of backers. And then there\u2019s the crowd who may dole out money to Sutskever and Gross just to screw with Altman.  Look, if some rich people want to fund Safe Superintelligence with their personal wealth, sure, why not? It\u2019s their money to lose.  But I suspect we could also see venture capitalists wanting to invest their funds in the company. Then it becomes a matter of wagering their limited partners\u2019 capital on a Hail Mary proposal from Sutskever and Gross. If that happens, their limited partners, a group that includes public pension funds, should have some serious qualms about the situation. In theory, they\u2019re expecting venture capitalists to invest in enterprises with at least some semblance of a strategy for generating revenue and profit, right? Sutskever and Gross, meanwhile, seem to have little interest in either.  Yes, plenty of venture capital\u2013backed startups change business models or have only the faintest idea for one. But Sutskever and Gross aren\u2019t scrambling to develop a business plan on the fly. From the very start, they\u2019re insisting the lack of a plan is the plan. For that reason, I\u2019d hope everyone financially contributing to Safe Superintelligence has enough common sense to see their funding as a philanthropic donation, not an investment for economic gain. I\u2019m sure any form of superintelligence would agree with me. Frankly, Abram Brown, editor of The Information\u2019s Weekend section, likes to think of himself as a superintelligence. You can reach him at abe@theinformation.com or find him on X. Jacob Helberg, Palantir adviser and husband of venture capitalist Keith Rabois, describes his relationship with former president Donald Trump as \u201ca true love story.\u201d  \u201cWe just can\u2019t stay away from each other,\u201d he told our Margaux MacColl.  Helberg and Trump certainly are tight, with Helberg assuming a key role as a MAGA link to Silicon Valley. (Trump keenly wants to win back America\u2019s business elites, a group that has largely abandoned him.) At the same time, Helberg, a former Democrat, has managed to keep his appeal and ties to leftist techies, Margaux explains in this week\u2019s Big Read.  \u201cHe has a very simple, disarming style,\u201d said venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, a prominent Silicon Valley Democrat who appeared at a recent conference hosted by Helberg that convened tech and political elites. \u201cHis style helps a lot in getting people together.\u201d Need to plan a hike in the Bavarian Alps? Want to win a debate about whether that\u2019s Lyra or Leo? Figure out what that fungus is? Brigid Mander, a frequent Weekend contributor, has assembled a list of the best apps for venturing out into the great outdoors. Ohhh, darn it, now what fungus did I just step in\u2026 Listening: The Times Goes to the Dogs Let\u2019s be honest: As much as \u201cThe Daily\u201d from The New York Times has ascended to a position as shining North Star for podcasters, it can be dull and dreary and tends to dwell myopically on U.S. politics. But ahhh! A breath of fresh air has arrived in the form of \u201cAnimal,\u201d a spinoff series from \u201cThe Daily\u201d that appears on Sundays.  \u201cAnimal\u201d benefits from a charming host, Sam Anderson, a New York Times Magazine staff writer, and a simple conceit: Each week, Anderson delivers what you might call a spoken essay about a different fauna. So far, he has examined dogs, puffins, manatees and, most recently, ferrets.  In each episode, Anderson displays a real magazine writer\u2019s skill for first-person reportage and setting his stories in unique places. To talk about puffins, for instance, Anderson traveled to a tiny Icelandic village that\u2019s home to a gigantic puffin colony; the village residents spend part of the year rescuing fledgling puffins from their collision with modern life.  As for the ferrets, Anderson journeyed to the Ferret Buckeye Bash, a giant convention of ferret enthusiasts in Columbus, Ohio. The highlight: a competition akin to the Westminster Kennel Club\u2019s annual dog show\u2014except, of course, with ferrets. Playing: Beasties From Below  Anyone who has seen and enjoyed James Cameron\u2019s \u201cThe Abyss\u201d or John Carpenter\u2019s \u201cThe Thing\u201d will find themselves right at home aboard the Beira D oil rig in the North Sea. That rig makes for the exceptionally atmospheric setting for \u201cStill Wakes the Deep,\u201d a new horror videogame from The Chinese Room, a British studio named for a thought experiment that sought to discredit artificial intelligence.  The Chinese Room\u2019s games are big and brainy, and in the case of \u201cStill Wakes the Deep\u201d quite brawny, too, with aging Scottish electrician, Cameron McLeary, as the protagonist. He\u2019s no demigod or advanced soldier, which makes \u201cStill Wakes the Deep\u201d a real challenge: There\u2019s no magic machine gun to get you past the mutated monsters all around.  Watching: A Gifted Grifter\u2019s Return  As much as I wish a trip to the dreamy Italian coast lay in store for me this summer, it very much does not. So I have taken solace in catching up with Netflix\u2019s stellar \u201cRipley,\u201d an adaptation of the Thomas Ripley novels created by author Patricia Highsmith. It might seem challenging for a new Ripley-based series to thoroughly surpass the very well received 1999 film \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d which starred Jude Law and Matt Damon and collected several Oscar nominations. Rest assured, \u201cRipley\u201d does,  having found an ideal actor, Andrew Scott (\u201cFleabag,\u201d \u201cAll of Us Strangers\u201d), to inhabit Highsmith\u2019s murderous huckster\u2014a pretty face hiding subtle cunning.  Quite memorably, \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley\u201d relied on a golden, sunny color palette. Netflix\u2019s \u201cRipley\u201d goes in a completely different direction, relying on exquisite black-and-white photography from Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Elswit (\u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d). Elswit\u2019s framing creates a wealth of small but indelible moments, like an early scene at a bank in which Ripley eyes a stack of checks with the ravenous longing of a starving man arriving at a smorgasbord.

        "heading": "Nvidia Passes Microsoft in Value, Heightening Risks",

        "publish_date": "Jun 18, 2024, 5:00pm PDT",
        "body_content": "Nvidia is No. 1! A 3.5% rally in the artificial intelligence chipmaker\u2019s stock on Tuesday, as most other tech stocks fell, catapulted its market capitalization above that of both Microsoft and Apple for the first time. It ended the day worth $3.34 trillion, while Microsoft was valued at $3.31 trillion and Apple was at $3.29 trillion. Those are big numbers: By comparison, the collective value of all stocks in the U.K., the biggest stock market in Europe, is $3.18 trillion, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Not to be a pessimist, but why does it feel like Nvidia\u2019s relentless rally\u2014the stock is up 174% so far this year, according to Koyfin, while the other big tech stocks are up between 10% and 20%\u2014is a correction waiting to happen? Sure, Nvidia\u2019s stock has risen in line with its revenue, which went up 262% in its fiscal first quarter ended April, reflecting intense demand for its specialized chips. But we published a deep dive into the company today, which pointed out that CEO Jensen Huang is worried. He\u2019s surely conscious that the higher Nvidia rises, the harder it could fall. As the story noted, the big tech companies buying many of his chips are making enormous investments in AI technology with an uncertain return\u2014a reality that could cause them to pull back if business doesn\u2019t end up following their spending.  Huang\u2019s solutions include tactics that seem likely to draw scrutiny from antitrust regulators\u2014and the Justice Department has reportedly already opened an investigation into Nvidia. For instance, Nvidia is competing with the big cloud providers\u2014Amazon, Microsoft and Google\u2014which also happen to be among its biggest customers. Nvidia is renting servers powered by its chips to businesses, operating as a cloud firm itself. Not only that, it is operating those servers on clusters that it leases from the cloud providers themselves! You have to wonder why those cloud firms would agree to that, unless they\u2019re nervous about losing access to Nvidia\u2019s chips.  Another Nvidia tactic: It\u2019s trying to persuade customers to install its chip on server racks it has designed, which could make it harder for those customers to easily switch AI chips. We reported that Nvidia and Microsoft had a bit of a tussle over this issue, although Nvidia eventually backed down. Both these tactics point to Huang\u2019s sense of vulnerability, a feeling that anyone buying Nvidia stock at these levels should share. What goes up, at least at this rate, might also come down. Elon Musk is appearing at the Cannes Lion advertising festival on Wednesday, where he\u2019s likely to pitch the benefits of advertising on his X platform once again. Presumably, he won\u2019t tell advertisers to \u201cgo fuck\u201d themselves as he did last November, in response to a reported advertiser boycott of the platform after he posted comments viewed as antisemitic.  But even if he\u2019s on his best behavior, Musk may face a dubious crowd. As we reported today, X\u2019s share of national ad spending on social media has fallen to less than 1%, compared with 12% a couple of years ago, before he bought the company. The good news is that ad rates have fallen so low some small advertisers are trying X out and finding its returns comparable to what they get on Meta Platforms, only with a smaller-scale audience. The bad news, as our story says, is that other advertisers remain unwilling to even try X out. In fact, for many advertisers, X is now irrelevant. A Musk appearance at Cannes isn\u2019t likely to change that.

        "heading": "Americans Are Impressed with China\u2019s AI",
        "author_name": "Stephanie Palazzolo",
        "publish_date": "Jun 18, 2024, 7:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "American pundits like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt like to say China is behind the U.S. in artificial intelligence by several years. But American AI researchers increasingly tell me that these people underestimate Chinese researchers. Instead, by restricting Chinese access to American tech, the U.S. has pushed the country to forge its own path in AI development (or find workarounds to the U.S. export rules, as in the case of ByteDance). And Chinese developers are catching up. The latest example is an open-weight large language model for generating computer code that came out yesterday. The company behind it, a Chinese quant trading firm called High-Flyer Capital Management, said its model beat OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 Turbo, Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro and Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus on a number of standard, industry evaluations. High-Flyer created the coding model, DeepSeek-Coder-V2, by training a general purpose large language model on 6 trillion tokens of web data, consisting mostly of software code or math problems, in addition to the more than 4 trillion tokens the original model was trained on. (In case you\u2019ve forgotten, \u201ctokens\u201d refers to words or parts of words that AI models ingest.)  The model resolved nearly 13% of the coding errors on SWE-bench, a popular evaluation benchmark for coding models. That figure might not sound so impressive until you consider that GPT-4o\u2014OpenAI\u2019s latest flagship model\u2014can only solve 14.6% of those problems and Devin\u2014a coding model whose developer, Cognition, landed a $2 billion valuation after just six months\u2014can solve 13.86% of errors. Several founders of startups that also develop AI generators of software code told me they were impressed by the DeepSeek model and by other recent Chinese AI model releases, like Alibaba\u2019s Qwen2 general purpose LLM. The DeepSeek model also has a large context window\u2014the amount of information it can accept in a single query\u2014making it especially helpful for software engineers, as it allows the model to remember other relevant parts of a codebase when it answers a coding question, the founders said.  As Hugging Face engineer Philipp Schmid pointed out in a post on X, developers can also optimize\u2014otherwise known as quantize, in industry lingo\u2014the smaller version of DeepSeek-Coder-V2 to create a version that runs locally on devices like laptops. It\u2019s notable that DeepSeek wasn\u2019t created by a traditional AI lab. While we\u2019re not sure why a hedge fund has gotten into the open-weight LLM game, it\u2019s no secret quant firms in the U.S. are very much in the LLM game (see examples here and here). But while High Flyer has been happy to confirm its involvement, U.S. quant firms hide their work because, presumably, they want to make money from it! This isn\u2019t the first time China has impressed the American AI community. The country\u2019s researchers are known for computer vision and publish more papers on the topic than researchers from any other nation, according to research from Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. (It likely helps that the surveillance footage its government collects can be used to improve those researchers\u2019 computer vision and other AI models.) And as some of you noticed two weeks ago, Kuaishou\u2019s AI video model, Kling, turned heads among American AI video makers. China got a late start in conversational AI, but it may not be as far off as some Americans want it to be. Here\u2019s what else is going on\u2026 AI founders today could learn a thing or two from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. This feature from my colleagues Anissa Gardizy and Qianer Liu highlights a trait that has powered much of the executive\u2019s success: his paranoia.  After surviving multiple near-death experiences, Huang is well-practiced at anticipating the next threat coming down the road. Now, his priority is preparing for a possible future where demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips has slowed. That means taking steps like making sure Nvidia\u2019s customers have enough room to install its AI chips, potentially leasing its own data centers directly and diversifying the company\u2019s revenue beyond hardware.  That paranoid energy is what I want from more of today\u2019s AI chip challengers. Many of these startups seem too focused on the model flavor of the month without thinking about how to remain relevant beyond transformer models or LLMs. Maybe they could learn a lesson from the chip giant they\u2019re trying to overthrow. See The Information\u2019s Generative AI Database for an exclusive list of private companies and their investors. Finbourne, a London-based startup that aims to help financial companies use their data more efficiently, raised $70 million in funding co-led by Highland Europe and AXA Venture Partners at a $356 million post-investment valuation. Decagon, which develops AI-powered customer support software, raised $35 million in seed and Series A funding led by Accel, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, A*, Elad Gil and angel investors. CuspAI, a Cambridge, U.K.-based startup that uses AI to develop new materials, raised $30 million in a seed round led by Hoxton Ventures, with participation from Basis Set Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners. SewerAI, which uses AI to spot defects in sewer pipes, raised a $15 million Series B funding round led by Innovius Capital, with participation from Emerald VC, Epic Ventures, Suffolk Ventures, Bentley Systems, Burnt Island Ventures and others. Maxim AI, which helps developers build AI-powered apps, raised $3 million in funding led by Elevation Capital.  Proofs, a startup that aims to speed up software development using AI, raised $2.6 million in pre-seed funding from EarlyBird Digital East, alongside Expeditions Fund, Step Function Ventures, RTP Global and others. 100k+ readers rely on The Information's Creator Economy newsletter for coverage of the creator startups making waves, big tech companies' social media playbooks, and scoops on the sector's biggest hires.

        "heading": "The Very Best Wedding Planners for a Tech Mogul Blowout",
        "author_name": "Julia Black",
        "publish_date": "Jun 15, 2024, 6:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "After 15 years as a high-end wedding planner in California, Ashley Smith often feels like she has seen and heard it all. That\u2019s why she especially enjoys when a tech founder or a venture capitalist calls her up: They often have a vision that challenges her. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2013type clients have seen it all. They go to events often, they travel often, and they have access to social clubs and high-priority access memberships that change their perspective on weddings, travel, fashion and lifestyle decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are generally one to five steps ahead of the curve.\" Smith and the other masters of matrimonial affairs on our list below are familiar with tech world clients and can do everything a Silicon Valley titan might want from a wedding planner: Figure out how to get goods up a mountain with no roads (via helicopter!), source menus from brands like Petrossian, and replace classic spectacles (fireworks) with new-age ones (drone shows). Smith sees her end goal as twofold: \u201cFor the wedding planning process to be fun,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also to make our clients look rad.\u201d A note on hiring a planner and pricing: Regardless of where these planners are located, most of them will be flexible with planning destination weddings. To secure the services of these in-demand planners, you\u2019ll need to book at least a year in advance. Pricing is variable but typically charged as a percentage of the wedding\u2019s full cost. (Their more \u201cmodest\u201d affairs still run in the upper six figures.) Founder and creative director, Sugokuii Events When Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd married oil and gas heir Michael Herd in Positano, Italy, she enlisted Sorenson and the Sugokuii team to produce her chic, nonstop party weekend. The event included custom monograms on everything from couch cushions to guest gift bags and a giant mille-feuille cake prepared live by a team of pastry chefs in front of the Herds\u2019 guests. \u201cEverything we do is pretty much custom-made\u2014whether it\u2019s a napkin or a bar or a sofa,\u201d said Sorenson, who previously spent years working in events for fashion designers like Hugo Boss and Vivienne Westwood. Sugokuii has turned private island beaches into nightclubs and even built an entire venue\u2014complete with a dance floor and a chef\u2019s kitchen\u2014from scratch on the top of Monte Solaro in Capri. (No roads run up Monte Solaro, which looms over Capri at 1,900 feet above sea level, so everything for the wedding had to be transported in 147 helicopter trips; the guests arrived via chairlift.) While she\u2019s planned events in St. Barts and Mexico, Sorenson\u2019s true specialty is Southern Italy, where she spent much of her childhood. Her familiarity with Italy helps her navigate the local vendors who \u201cdon\u2019t really like timelines and don\u2019t really appreciate lots of emails.\u201d Owner, Ashley Smith Events Born in Marin County and based in San Francisco, Ashley Smith takes pride in bringing what she called \u201cthe uniquely Californian spirit of ease and experimentation\u201d to destinations from Puerto Escondido, Mexico, to Lake Como, Italy. A favorite among foodies, Smith will source menus from her clients\u2019 favorite restaurants or celebrity chefs. For instance, when Lance Lin, an Apple public relations director, married Jared Levan, an Impossible Foods brand marketing manager, Smith re-created New York\u2019s Indochine nightclub\u2014down to the leafy wallpaper\u2014inside their Napa, Calif., venue for the after-party. And when Sweetgreen co-founder Nicolas Jammet married Enlisst founder and CEO Holly Liss Jammet on a private Santa Barbara, Calif., ranch, guests snacked on custom items from restaurants like Sqirl, Tartine and Petrossian. CEO, Colin Cowie Lifestyle Among the world\u2019s most famous wedding planners, Cowie has worked with celebrities like J. Lo and Ben Affleck as well as tech heavyweights like DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang, who hired Cowie\u2019s team for a Napa Valley vineyard wedding that featured Chinese lion dancers and a Maroon 5 performance. Cowie, who is based in Miami but also has offices in New York and Los Angeles, has become known for plotting over-the-top spectacles, like arranging for a fleet of ships anchored off the coast of Marblehead, Mass. to send up a cannon-blast salute at a rehearsal dinner. His team especially enjoys working with Silicon Valley clients, who get excited about integrating new technologies into their celebrations. \u201cDrone shows are the new fireworks,\u201d said Cowie, whose team can send 2,000 drones into the sky to create complex light shows. For another recent client, his team took over SFMOMA, projecting video mapping all over the gallery to envelope guests in an immersive experience. With such elaborate spectacles, \u201cyou get to take people on a journey,\u201d he said. Founder, Arelt Events In 2021, heiress Ivy Getty decided to have a City Hall wedding. No, this wasn\u2019t a humble elopement in front of the city clerk: The bride wanted to shut down San Francisco\u2019s City Hall. In fact, she practically took over the city of San Francisco for her three-day affair, including a \u201cBarbarella\u201d-inspired disco DJed by Mark Ronson and a sprawling picnic in the Presidio overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. To execute this level of decadence, Getty turned to designer Stanlee Gatti and wedding planner Jocelyn Arelt. Northern California\u2013based Arelt has planned luxury weddings for a number of venture capitalists in northern California, as well as for California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Jennifer Siebel Newsom on a Montana ranch. But if you do hire Arelt, you can count on getting her full attention: She only takes on a few handpicked events every year so she can stay focused on each client. Founder, JZ Events In 2017, Jennifer Zabinski made Serena Williams\u2019 fairy-tale dreams come true for the tennis star\u2019s New Orleans wedding to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Guests including Beyonc\u00e9 and Kim Kardashian watched Williams walk down the runway-style aisle in a $3.5 million dress, before proceeding to a \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d\u2013themed ball and an after-party featuring an illuminated carousel. In 2018, MPowerHealth founder Scott LaRoque and Alla Kosovo enlisted Zabinski for their five-day wedding extravaganza in Ravello, Italy. Just one part of that pageant involved the wedding party and their guests cruising up the Amalfi Coast in vintage sports cars, a nod to the Mille Miglia motorsport race of the 20th century. Zabinski has also planned opulent bashes at New York\u2019s Natural History Museum and at luxury resorts, including one at Eden Rock in St. Barts where she helped wrangle Aerosmith for a reception performance.

        "body_content": "Mylene Mae has found success with turning short Reels on Instagram into a series of related videos. She\u2019s part of an emerging trend of creators doing so.  Mae, 24, first started posting last April, initially focusing on sharing long-form YouTube videos about her efforts to learn how to code and life as a recent college graduate. On YouTube, she hoped to hit 10,000 subscribers. Instead, she reached about 1,000 before changing course.  \u201cYouTube is really hard,\u201d said Mae, whose given last name is Tu. \u201cSo I pivoted into Instagram.\u201d  At the end of last year, she started posting a series of videos on Reels titled \u201c23 lessons from 2023,\u201d which spanned until April, where she touched on topics like how to effectively set goals or why to think twice before taking someone else\u2019s advice.  \u201cThe hardest thing about getting started is there are so many variables you cannot control, like you don\u2019t know what platform to use or editing tools to use or what style works or which niche,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a series helped me in the beginning, because I could focus on a centralized theme, but I could experiment within that constraint. People knew to expect a life lesson, but the style could change throughout the series.\u201d The sixth video of the series finally went viral, totaling about 3.5 million views. After that, she said her account jumped from 400 followers to 70,000 in the span of about a week. Now, she has nearly 170,000 followers on Instagram. Mae tried reposting those same videos to YouTube Shorts and TikTok, but would only get a few thousand views, a sliver of the attention they received on Instagram. Mae, who is based in Los Angeles, works full-time at a video-editing software startup, but also earns money as a creator, primarily through sponsorships with advertisers such as Adobe and laptop maker Asus.  The highest-profile example of short-form series succeeding came on TikTok, from Reesa Teesa, whose real name is Tareasa Johnson. Earlier this year, she shared a 50-part set of clips in five to ten minute increments on TikTok about her marriage gone wrong.  Mae\u2019s are even shorter, spanning about 40 seconds long. She thinks Instagram has an advantage over TikTok because it has built out a variety of other features that make it easier for creators to connect with fans, not just rack up views, including broadcast channels, which allow creators to chat with top fans in a group message. Meanwhile, direct messaging on TikTok hasn\u2019t taken off.  Up next, she is considering more mini series on different topics, which could be shorter with five videos or another 20-part project. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m playing around with different styles and types of editing,\u201d she said.  Here\u2019s what else is going on\u2026 See The Information\u2019s Creator Economy Database for an exclusive list of private companies and their investors. Omnicom, an ad holding company, partnered with Instacart to make it easier for users to shop ingredients needed for recipes or items for skincare routines from creators on the grocery shopping app.  Universal Music Group announced an agreement with AI music startup SoundLabs. The partnership allows UMG artists and producers to use the startup\u2019s AI feature MicDrop for actions like converting a human voice into instruments from humming a melody or making versions of their voices in different languages.  Pocket FM, an India-based startup offering audio series similar to podcasts as well as a writing service, partnered with ElevenLabs, an AI text to voice startup, so that writers can convert their written work into audio series.  Izea, a publicly-traded influencer marketing company, announced new features including the ability for creators to generate an AI version of their voice and then share that digital voice with their talent managers or brands for sponsorships.  HeyGen, an AI video generation startup, announced it raised $60 million in Series A funding led by Benchmark. The Information first reported about the fundraising efforts in March.  Daydream, an AI-powered search engine for e-commerce founded by Julie Bornstein, raised a $50 million seed round co-led by Forerunner Ventures and Index Ventures. Bornstein previously founded retail app The Yes, which Pinterest later acquired. Daydream will provide personalized shopping results for customers using generative AI. (We wrote about Bornstein as part of The Information\u2019s Free Agent series, tracking executives who have left companies.) Butterflies AI, a new social network for humans and AIs to \u201cco-exist,\u201d launched this week and announced $4.8 million in seed funding led by Coatue Management. The startup was founded by former longtime Snap engineer Vu Tran. Users create \u201cbutterflies,\u201d or AI personas with backstories, opinions and emotions, that automatically create posts that humans and other AIs can interact with.  Gracia AI announced a $1.2 million seed round led by Venture Reality Fund, which the startup will use to launch a YouTube-like platform for professional creators to share virtual reality content. TikTok said the new law forcing a sale or ban of the app in the U.S. should be overturned, according to a court brief on Thursday, the latest update in the legal battle over the app\u2019s future in the country. \u201cNever before has Congress silenced so much speech in a single act,\u201d the brief said, adding that it \u201csets a dangerous precedent allowing the political branches to target a disfavored speech platform and force it to sell or be shut down.\u201d The Texas Ethics Commission voted to require social media influencers to disclose when they are paid for political ads. Last year, The Texas Tribune reported that creators were quietly paid to support impeached Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian will launch a video podcast on X this fall as the platform tries to strike more original content deals. It\u2019s not clear what topics the podcast will focus on, but the deal comes as X has lost major advertisers.  A Touch More, a production company founded by former professional athletes Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe, is partnering with Vox Media to relaunch and expand their sports and pop culture podcast, A Touch More Live. The effort originally started as an Instagram Live series during the pandemic.    John Deere announced that Rex Curtiss, a TikTok creator and recent college graduate, will be its \u201cchief tractor officer,\u201d responsible for developing content for John Deere\u2019s social media accounts. (Read more about John Deere\u2019s strategy with the role here.)  Van Leeuwen Ice Cream is hiring a full-time content creator, based in Brooklyn, to take the ice cream company\u2019s \u201cdigital footprint to the next level,\u201d according to a job posting.

        "body_content": "We\u2019re living in a world of AI-powered news. No, I don\u2019t mean large-language models are writing news reports\u2014just the opposite. In tech business news, at least, AI is the thread that runs through most everything nowadays. Apple\u2019s AI presentation on Monday drove this week\u2019s news cycle, while the other big story of the week, Tesla\u2019s shareholder vote over Elon Musk\u2019s pay, also had AI as a subtext\u2014specifically his involvement in the company\u2019s AI efforts. Despite the ubiquity of AI in news coverage, one point doesn\u2019t get enough scrutiny: Are the advances society is going to get from the new technology worth the cost? By cost, I particularly mean the impact on the power supply. Data center demands for power threaten to suck the energy world dry, setting back efforts to shift away from carbon-emitting power sources. And to what end? Judging from how some tech companies are marketing their AI-powered services, it\u2019s about helping consumers design a menu for a dinner party, plan a vacation or find a photo on their phone. (The idea, of course, is to get consumers to spend money on new devices or AI subscriptions.) Or it\u2019s about helping businesses improve employee productivity, including by cutting jobs (great!). Despite the attention these uses have drawn, the real promise of AI surely is its potential to help solve existential challenges like deadly disease or dangerous drivers. Efforts to utilize the new tech in those directions are underway. Google, for instance, has its AlphaFold project aimed at accelerating cures for diseases. Elon Musk is making AI the centerpiece of his efforts at Tesla to develop fully autonomous driving. Microsoft, meanwhile, is using AI to try to improve cybersecurity, among other things\u2014an effort that can\u2019t come too soon. Data breaches at major companies\u2014including one recently at Snowflake, which affected several of its customers\u2014have become so commonplace that they draw little attention despite the pain they inflict. No one knows the issue better than Microsoft, whose president, Brad Smith, was hauled over the coals about the company\u2019s cybersecurity failings at a congressional hearing on Thursday.  But fighting deadly diseases, solving autonomous driving and even fixing cybersecurity aren\u2019t cheap or quick undertakings. Yet big tech companies are spending tens of billions of dollars to develop AI, so they need a return. The danger is that the need for quick returns from the consumer and business services will skew investments, shortchanging more important needs. Unlike AI startups like Anthropic and OpenAI, big companies aren't governed by nonprofits requiring them to put humanity's interests first. Let\u2019s hope AI\u2019s biggest advances don't end up being trivialities like saving consumers a bit of time while they play with their phones.

        "heading": "With IPOs Off Limits, Software Investors Pin Hopes on PE Buyouts",

        "body_content": "Hi, it\u2019s Akash. I\u2019ve been in Toronto at the Collision Conference, Canada\u2019s annual technology convention. It drew more than 37,800 attendees, along with big names like Vinod Khosla and the country\u2019s own artificial intelligence royalty, Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez, as well as the \u201cgodfather of AI,\u201d Geoffrey Hinton. Last year at this event, AI was still new and novel, and speakers joked at dinners about how many times it would be said on panels. This year, the discussion was more concrete, with most people wrestling with the technology\u2019s real-world uses\u2014to advance self-driving cars, medicine and manufacturing, to name a few areas of potential. Beyond AI, venture capitalists have also been grappling with what is to come of all the enterprise software businesses that raised money during the pandemic funding boom, reaping the benefits of businesses\u2019 lavish software spending budgets, but that now are seeing growth slow. First-quarter results from larger, public software companies like Salesforce, Workday, and MongoDB all showed enterprise customers are continuing to tighten their wallets. Few privately held companies have grown big enough to consider an IPO. Jai Das, co-founder and managing partner of enterprise software\u2013focused Sapphire Ventures, told me in a panel interview that firms need to be generating at least $500 million in annual recurring revenue to be big enough to raise around $500 million and attract interest from large, well-known investors like Fidelity Management or T. Rowe Price.  Since companies can typically expect to sell about 10% of their shares in an offering, that means their market cap should be in the neighborhood of $5 billion based on current valuation multiples, he said. Rubrik, the cybersecurity firm that went public in April, fit this bill almost to a T. It raised roughly $752 million in its offering, generated more than $537 million in revenue last year and currently has a market cap more than $5.3 billion. As for companies that haven\u2019t yet gone public, StubHub\u2019s revenue totaled $1.4 billion in the twelve months ending September 2023, and it is expected to list shares before the end of the summer, The Information reported in April. Neobank Chime generated $1.3 billion in revenue last year, according to Forbes, and it turned profitable in the first quarter of this year, its CEO Chris Britt recently told my colleague Michael Roddan. But many privately held software companies don\u2019t hit the bar of going public. In addition to reaching the $500 million top-line target, Das also said firms should be growing revenue by at least 20% and aim to break even on free cash flow.  \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of companies that meet those criteria, which means there\u2019s not a lot of IPO-able companies,\u201d he said. So what\u2019s a smaller, slow-growing software company to do? Many are looking for homes at larger firms. And in fact, some established software companies are on the hunt for deals.  Earlier this month, Databricks bought data management company Tabular for $1 billion, and Shift4 said it closed its deal to buy point-of-sale technology company Revel Systems for a reported $250 million. Some investors also told me private equity firms have also been canvasing the market for smaller companies generating less than $100 million in annual recurring revenue that they can roll up into portfolio companies they\u2019ve already acquired.  Earlier this year, Permira bought a majority stake in fraud detection company BioCatch, buying out Bain Capital\u2019s and Maverick Venture\u2019s stakes for $1.3 billion. Thoma Bravo-owned Anaplan bought software company Fluence Technologies in April. And Canadian private equity company Constellation Software\u2019s leadership told The Globe and Mail earlier this year it\u2019s now looking on the market for startups of that size. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of musical chairs\u201d between small, slow growing software companies and private-equity owned portfolio companies, said Michael Yang, a senior managing partner at Omers Ventures. From his perspective, many founders of those startups are now realizing \u201cwe\u2019re not all going to make it all to IPO scale. We may not ever be able to get there. We should be more open to dialogue\u2026and selling.\u201d Every weekday, The Briefing helps executives get smarter about the latest in tech, media and finance. Subscribe for free now.

        "body_content": "Most readers of The Information support the U.S.\u2019s pending ban of TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app, though a significant minority oppose the ban scheduled to take effect early next year, according to our latest reader survey. Opinions about the ban divided sharply based on whether a respondent said they use the app. The roughly one-third of respondents who said they use TikTok disapproved of the ban by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Nonusers favored the ban by a slightly larger margin."

        "body_content": "Welcome, Weekenders! In this newsletter: Lately, misinformation researchers have expended a considerable amount of energy sounding the alarm about fake online content manipulated by artificial intelligence. They worry that as AI proliferates, more people with nefarious intentions will produce fake content so sophisticated that we won\u2019t be able to differentiate it from the real stuff.    This issue dominates the current conversation around misinformation to the point where you might think we\u2019ve successfully solved all the issues we had with the older, less sophisticated forms of misinformation that don\u2019t rely on AI. And from time to time, we see glimmers of hope that we have indeed wised up and gained some valuable immunity to misinformation. One example: the recent elections in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi attracted an underwhelming number of votes despite an onslaught of pro-Modi misinformation.  And then there are moments like the one involving a fake cannibal that make me realize futuristic fears of AI are the least of our worries: We\u2019re still falling for the dumbest fake news possible. Of course, I\u2019m talking about the collective online freakout over a story told by dim-witted actor Glen Powell on a fitness podcast: According to Powell, a friend of his sister went on a date with a man who rubbed lotion on her that began breaking down her skin as if he meant to soften her up to eat\u2014all right, let\u2019s stop there. You get the idea.  Enough people believed Powell\u2019s story was true that the actor then had to publicly admit someone had fooled him into believing the tale. The joke\u2019s on us, though, and it underscores just how perilous our relationship with misinformation remains.  Going forward, I\u2019d like to suggest we apply what I\u2019ll call the Powell Test to mostly everything on the internet\u2014whether we suspect it\u2019s possibly manipulated by AI or not. We should stop and ask ourselves: Is this something that beggars belief\u2014something we could imagine hearing a dim-witted actor recount on a podcast? If so, do a touchhhh more research and think a moment more before sharing it. I promise you won\u2019t even need an expensive agent, manager and publicist to put the Powell Test into action. Abram Brown, editor of The Information\u2019s Weekend section, fears this column may qualify him as a hit man. You can reach him at abe@theinformation.com or find him on X. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re very worried that the U.S. is going to run away with it again,\u201d lamented Hermann Hauser, the Austrian co-founder of U.K. semiconductor company Arm.  You can guess what Hauser is talking about. He made the comment to our Julia Black, whose globetrotting reporting brings us this week\u2019s Big Read on the efforts across the planet to develop artificial intelligence to rival America\u2019s and China\u2019s. Companies in countries including Britain, France, Japan and India hope not to repeat the same mistakes as their predecessors\u2014allowing U.S. and Chinese businesses to make off with all the riches, just as they have done in every technological era since the PC became a common household appliance. Those worries have intensified in the run-up to November\u2019s presidential election. \u201cEspecially if Trump becomes president again, he could say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to do whatever we tell you in order to have access to our AI models.\u2019 That would not be a good situation to be in,\u201d Hauser said. High-end wedding planner Ashley Smith enjoys it when a prospective tech founder or venture capitalist client reaches out: She knows they\u2019re going to have standards\u2014demands, you might say\u2014and that\u2019s a pleasant challenge after 15 years in the business. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2013type clients have seen it all. They go to events often, they travel often, and they have access to social clubs and high-priority access memberships that change their perspective on weddings, travel, fashion and lifestyle decisions,\u201d Smith said.  Our Julia does double duty this Weekend. Showing off her reporting versatility, she has compiled this roll of the finest masters of matrimony out there. They know how to make a wedding happen at 1,900 feet above sea level\u2014helicopters, a cable car\u2014and source a menu from a favorite brand, like, say, Petrossian caviar. Listening: Paul Giamatti\u2019s Paranormal Party \u201cHow did we get from facial hair to the existential dread of the desert?\u201d actor Paul Giamatti asked philosopher professor Stephen Asma in a recent and particularly discursive episode of their amusingly strange podcast, \u201cChinwag.\u201d (They call their listeners Wagoners, in case you were wondering.) The show delights in the weird: shipwrecks, spirit trumpets, \u201cDoctor Who\u201d\u2013based conspiracy theories, giant octopuses. At some point, you\u2019ll realize it really wasn\u2019t much of a stretch for Giamatti to play a strange and misfit professor in last year\u2019s \u201cThe Holdovers.\u201d  With Giamatti as a co-host, \u201cChinwag\u201d brings on plenty of famous guests. They too delight in the weird. Jesse Eisenberg recently made an appearance partly to shill for his new film \u201cSasquatch Sunset,\u201d a silent film about a Bigfoot family. Elizabeth Banks has joined Giamatti and Asma, too, discussing life in Hollywood and the big fear dominating there these days: AI. Banks is refusing to take the worry too seriously\u2014not until AI can reliably generate something like \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d which critics lauded for its peculiar absurdist humor. As Banks put it: \u201cIs AI really going to come up with a dildo fight?\u201d Reading: Demand and Supply Shortly after college, Hagan Walker spurned an engineering offer from Tesla and chose instead to head out on his own to establish a toy startup, Glo, in his native Mississippi (of all places!). A couple years passed, and just as Walker finally seemed to be getting someplace by winning a big \u201cSesame Street\u201d deal for light-up Elmos, the pandemic struck\u2014stranding the Elmos thousands of miles away in Ningbo, China, the world\u2019s third-largest container port. Walker had gotten caught up in what Peter Goodman, a veteran New York Times economics reporter, calls The Great Supply Chain Disruption. And Goodman makes Walker a central character in his new book, \u201cHow the World Ran Out of Everything,\u201d using the young entrepreneur\u2019s Elmo dilemma to illustrate the complexities\u2014and inefficiencies\u2014of how goods move across the planet. Goodman has a strong command of his book\u2019s subject matter and a keen interest in its history. He traces the modern supply chain back to Henry Ford and to Toyota\u2019s Taiichi Ohno\u2014who developed the concept of \u201clean manufacturing\u201d with its emphasis on limited warehouse stockpiles\u2014and documents how the globe\u2019s supply lines boomed in the Clinton era and after, becoming ever more interwoven. Such increased globalization, Goodman suggests, forced us to accept a trade-off: \u201cIn exchange for our tacit assent in the often-unsavory terms of global capitalism, we gained convenience and reliability to a degree that was unimaginable mere decades ago.\u201d Then the world\u2019s flow of goods came to a crashing halt in 2020, leaving Walker worried about his ability to get his Elmos under Christmas trees. The crisis presented not just \u201ca curious piece of recent history,\u201d Goodman argues, \u201cbut a preview of the dysfunction that surely lies ahead if we fail to get the machine in order.\u201d Watching: Giant Shark, Deux-Deux, Deux-Deux, Deux-Deux  It doesn\u2019t take a film scholar to know that much of what streams on Netflix is derivative of whatever attracted a decent audience last year. (Hence we get the never-ending versions of European police procedurals set in the woods and featuring creepy murders.) But \u201cUnder Paris\u201d takes that concept to a new level\u2014very obviously planting the 1975 classic \u201cJaws\u201d in the titular city\u2019s catacombs. If that sounds absurd, it is, but it is so absurd as to be entertaining.  Particularly gratifying is seeing the young environmentalist, who tries to \u201csave\u201d the killer giant shark\u2014thereby putting all of Paris at risk\u2014and ends up as its lunch. There are also the obligatory city officials, just as in \u201cJaws,\u201d who are more concerned with not disrupting a coming tourist event than with keeping people safe. \u201cUnder Paris\u201d isn\u2019t a deep film, despite its name, but it is a lot of fun.\u2014Martin Peers Guys, as we\u2019ve been telling you, the hoodie era is over.

        "body_content": "Will Europeans start to regret their governments\u2019 aggressive regulation of U.S. tech? That\u2019s surely going to be a question sparked by Apple\u2019s decision today to withhold a bunch of attractive new technologies\u2014such as its artificial intelligence\u2013powered offerings\u2014from its products in Europe, citing the continental rules on how tech firms operate. Many of the updates Apple unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference a couple of weeks ago won\u2019t show up anytime soon on European iPhones, iPads or Macs. That includes Apple Intelligence, which upgrades what Siri can do, including searching across apps for hard-to-find information, and iPhone Mirroring, which allows you to manipulate what\u2019s on your iPhone screen via your MacBook. According to Bloomberg, Apple blamed its decision on rules imposed by the Digital Markets Act in Europe. Is that a valid excuse? Who knows? In a way, it doesn\u2019t matter.  What\u2019s significant is that a U.S. tech giant is finally responding to the increasingly demanding European rules. It feels it\u2019s like only a matter of time before a U.S. company decides the European market simply isn\u2019t worth the trouble.   The question now is what impact Apple\u2019s decision will have.  Apple doesn\u2019t have the same market power in Europe that it does in the U.S. Data from research firm Canalys suggests Apple has more than half the U.S. smartphone market but only about a third of the European market. It\u2019s possible the new features would have helped lift Apple\u2019s share in Europe, of course. They only work on the latest phones, so they\u2019re expected to drive iPhone upgrades, boosting sales of the device, which have been stagnant lately. But Tim Cook may think taking a stand against European bureaucrat-in-chief Margrethe Vestager is worth the cost of lost iPhone sales. If that\u2019s what Cook is thinking, he should be applauded. There\u2019s ample evidence Europe\u2019s regulations are hurting the continent.  In this piece in The Wall Street Journal in January, columnist Greg Ip argued Europe was falling behind the U.S. and China in tech sectors such as AI and electric vehicles thanks to its rules. Apple\u2019s decision suggests Europeans may soon have to be content with substandard consumer tech services as well. Perhaps Europeans are fine with that. But if they\u2019re not, they know how to fix things.

        "heading": "Databricks Has an Edge on Snowflake\u2014but It May Not Be as Big as Investors Think",
        "author_name": "Anita Ramaswamy",
        "publish_date": "Jun 21, 2024, 6:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "It may not be on the scale of Apple\u2019s rivalry with Google, but the battle between Databricks and Snowflake is one of the most intense in Silicon Valley. Both firms help companies store and manage massive amounts of data\u2014a service that should become more valuable with the rise of generative AI models. Their duel has become so intense that two weeks ago Databricks upstaged Snowflake during the latter\u2019s annual customer conference by announcing the acquisition of Tabular, a company that Snowflake had reportedly also tried to buy. Right now Databricks looks to have the upper hand. Not only is it growing faster, its business seems more suitable to the world of artificial intelligence, which likely helps explain why Snowflake\u2019s stock has dropped 33% so far this year. That has cut Snowflake\u2019s market capitalization to $42 billion, a little under Databricks\u2019 last private valuation of $43 billion, although Databricks\u2019 revenue in the year to January was 75% smaller. In theory, that all bodes well for an initial public offering of Databricks, something that may come next year. And yet investors who are betting that Databricks will steal the data market from Snowflake may be missing the bigger picture. Structured v. Unstructured After all, what appeals to investors most about Databricks is its AI pitch. Databricks has expertise in storing and manipulating a class of data called \u201cunstructured\u201d\u2014such as photos, articles and audio files\u2014which is particularly useful for running generative AI models that create images or videos. Snowflake, in contrast, has historically had an edge in processing structured data, which typically consists of numbers or text stored in a format that\u2019s easy for programmers to parse through. Structured data aren\u2019t as useful in generative AI. But undercutting Databricks\u2019 narrative is the fact that its fastest-growing product is its four-year-old warehouse meant for storing structured data, according to executives at its conference\u2014exactly the data that aren\u2019t so helpful for AI. Another issue investors have to consider is the money Databricks is spending on AI. The company bought MosaicML, which helps companies customize AI models, last year for $1.3 billion. Its recent acquisition of Tabular ran the firm at least another $1 billion, according to CEO Ali Ghodsi. On top of that is Databricks\u2019 outlay on research and development. Chief Financial Officer Dave Conte said last week that R&D expenses were the equivalent of 33% of the company\u2019s sales in each of the last three fiscal years. That\u2019s higher than the comparable metric for Snowflake over that period, which according to Arete Research\u2019s senior analyst, Louis Lardenois, suggests Databricks may be significantly less profitable than Snowflake at a similar scale of revenue. Another risk is that Databricks\u2019 new AI offerings might alienate its partners, who market their services alongside its data storage product. David Menninger, an executive director of software research at ISG, noted that several of Databricks\u2019 newly announced AI products, such as its LakeFlow integration tool and analytics system known as AI/BI, replicate specific services already offered by its partners, including Tableau and dbt Labs. While it\u2019s not clear how much revenue these partners drive to Databricks specifically, Menninger estimated that such arrangements typically drive around one-third of sales for large software firms such as Databricks and Snowflake. Snowflake's Weapon Even if investors want to discount these risks in favor of Databricks\u2019 potential to grow in AI, they shouldn\u2019t rule out Snowflake as a formidable competitor. Its choice in February to appoint former Google executive Sridhar Ramaswamy as CEO, succeeding Frank Slootman, was aimed at jump-starting its work in AI. Since Ramaswamy took the top job, Snowflake has added support on its platform for storing data in new formats and has announced upcoming features, such as ones that let users develop their own AI-powered chatbots. Given Snowflake\u2019s steady stock price decline, though, it seems investors are skeptical. Right now, Snowflake is trading at about 10.6 times analysts\u2019 estimates of next year\u2019s sales, according to data from Koyfin. In comparison, Databricks\u2019 last private valuation implies a multiple of nearly 18 times forward sales. That\u2019s based on the company\u2019s projection that it expects to reach $2.4 billion in annualized revenue during its current fiscal year, which ends in January 2025. There\u2019s another reason for investors to be cautious about Databricks: Its biggest competition isn\u2019t Snowflake but large cloud operators. Companies like Amazon and Microsoft have been selling data management services similar to those from Databricks and Snowflake as an add-on to cloud contracts. Cloud Threat ISG\u2019s Menninger says the cloud firms use these offerings \u201ceffectively as loss leaders\u201d to lure customers to buy computing power\u2014the real moneymaker\u2014from them. And the cloud providers are big in this area. Gartner analyst Aaron Rosenbaum points out that Amazon\u2019s data analytics business alone grew by over $3 billion last year\u2014bigger than the combined revenue of Databricks and Snowflake over that period. Plus, Amazon can upsell its millions of existing customers on new AI tools, while Databricks and Snowflake are still small enough that they need to attract new clients, he added. \u201cThe issue for both [Databricks and Snowflake] is not about who wins versus each other, but about how both fit in versus the cloud service providers,\u201d Rosenbaum said. The good news, according to Menninger, is that companies often want to maintain some independence from their primary cloud provider, which so far has meant Snowflake and Databricks have been able to sign customers. While that implies the cloud firms won\u2019t kill them off, there\u2019s still a chance one will kill the other or both will hurt themselves in the process of trying to get ahead in AI. As Rosenbaum put it: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly clear that Databricks is bringing a lot of innovation. But as someone who started their career at a company that barely exists anymore\u2014Ingres, even though they created the relational database\u2014it is execution that has mattered a lot more in this world than innovation.\u201d Anita Ramaswamy is a financial analysis writer at The Information.

        "heading": "The Electric: Apple\u2019s AI-Infused iPhone Should Worry Next-Gen Battery Developers",
        "author_name": "Steve LeVine",
        "publish_date": "Jun 17, 2024, 4:30am PDT",
        "body_content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook and his lieutenants spoke for two hours last week about the jazzed-up artificial intelligence features they plan to integrate into the newest iPhone. But they left out what ought to be one of the most critical words in the consumer AI revolution: battery. As in, \u201cThis is how we intend to power all these energy-sucking cool programs.\u201d That omission should worry iPhone users, since what benefit are the new functions if you can\u2019t use them freely? It should also concern investors in next-generation battery developers, some of which have promoted their batteries as necessary enablers of AI functions such as those Apple unveiled. But the iPhone maker may have decided it doesn\u2019t need such batteries, betting that advances in chip technology will take care of the added power demands.  The features that Cook and crew introduced June 10 included some that were simple, practical, and not very energy intensive, such as tools to help users edit and summarize emails and other messages. But there were other, more complex AI features. For instance, Apple introduced a new, juiced-up Siri, capable of carrying out household requests such as a search for dinner ingredients, for furniture or for a dress resembling a photo in a magazine. Such requests use many times the battery power of a simple Google search, though how much more is disputed. Apple did not respond to an email. But that its AI upgrade has power problems seemed clear in its announcement that the tools will only work on the latest iPhone 15 Pro; it appears that anything below that model lacks the battery, processing power and memory to handle the new functionality. If you want to use the AI tools, and you don\u2019t already own an iPhone 15 Pro, costing $999 to $1,499, you will have to buy one, a successor model or the latest iPad or laptop. Among next-gen battery companies that have sold themselves as an answer to such AI woes is Enovix, a Fremont, Calif.\u2013based startup that is filled with veterans of the chip industry. Enovix, backed by Cypress Semiconductor founder T.J. Rodgers, is attempting to scale up production of a silicon anode that it says can boost the energy output of an electronic device up to 50%. Enovix declined to comment for this story. But in a post on Medium earlier this year, Enovix CEO Raj Talluri\u2014a former senior executive at Qualcomm and Micron Technology\u2014said the requirement to sell new phones every year pushes manufacturers to keep adding new functionality and applications, such as for video and the camera. These functions in turn demand more power, calling for batteries such as Enovix\u2019s, Talluri claims. Enovix\u2019s anode isn\u2019t currently used in any commercial devices.   Of course, chips are steadily becoming more power efficient\u2014when used for everyday tasks like texting, browsing, shooting photos and telephoning, the latest smartphones can last a full day and longer. And chipmakers claim their advances will solve the AI issue. In a June 3 interview with Bloomberg, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said that when running Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Plus AI assistant, his company\u2019s new Snapdragon X Elite chip uses less than a tenth as much battery energy as traditional chips delivering the same output. Nvidia says its latest Blackwell chip is 25 times more energy efficient than Hopper, its predecessor. Apple\u2019s equivalent is the A17 Pro, the chip in the iPhone 15 Pro.   On a technical level, these chips handle the demands of AI through the incorporation of a relatively new type of processor called a neural processing unit, or NPU. The devices send the usual graphics to traditional graphics and central processing units, dedicating the NPU to AI requests. \u201cYou can have the graphics going on the GPU, and then the AI runs on the NPU,\u201d said Kevin Krewell, a semiconductor industry veteran and an analyst at Tirias Research, a high-tech research firm. \u201cAll those things can happen simultaneously.\u201d In a June 7 note to clients, TD Cowen analyst Gabe Daoud said such high-efficiency chips create \u201cobvious headwinds\u201d for Enovix and makers of other next-generation batteries whose main selling point is their accommodation of AI-infused features. The likelihood, though, is that the advent of new AI features means devices will need both better chips and better batteries. An analogy is what happens when a new highway is built in a traffic-congested area, as author Robert Caro described in \u201cThe Power Broker,\u201d his 1974 biography of Robert Moses, the New York City official who oversaw construction of many of the area\u2019s major highways from the 1930s to the 1960s. \u201cThe more highways were built to alleviate congestion, the more automobiles would pour into them and congest them and thus force the building of more highways,\u201d Caro wrote. So it has been with smartphones and seems likely to continue\u2014regardless of how efficient chips get, consumers will want more features, and smartphone makers will keep adding them. \u201cWhat I have found is that no matter what performance we have today, we\u2019ll want more tomorrow,\u201d said Krewell.  Rick Luebbe, CEO of silicon anode developer Group14 Technologies, said the insatiable appetite for new smartphone functions creates demand for next-gen batteries. \u201cIf a silicon battery can deliver 50% more energy density, that gives the device manufacturer that much more flexibility on the utility they can put into that system, whether or not the efficiency of the device keeps up,\u201d he said. Some of the power issues for next-generation iPhones will not involve AI at all but rather gaming: Apple has made clear that it hopes to wean gamers off consoles and desktop computers and onto the iPhone. The company is promoting the device as \u201cthe best gaming platform in the world.\u201d Last week, Apple executives spent much time showing off the iPhone\u2019s clear resolution, fast response time, \u201cspatial audio\u201d with virtual speakers surrounding a player, and improved special effects involving fire, weather and water. As Pocketgamer.biz pointed out, gamers can now run high-profile games on their iPhones, such as Assassin\u2019s Creed: Mirage, Resident Evil Village and Death Stranding: Director\u2019s Cut. Gaming doesn\u2019t involve AI but is nonetheless a massive battery drain. Krewell equated gamers to electric vehicle drag racers: Many current EVs offer 300 miles of driving range and more, he said, but \u201cif you\u2019re drag-racing the car, you\u2019re not going to get 300 miles of battery life.\u201d Similarly, if an iPhone user is playing some of the most popular games, with their demanding graphics and fast response times, those games will empty the battery. Such users will simply have to have an extra battery pack on hand or accept limits on their game use. No chip or battery innovation is going to give them limitless gaming time. This is where startups like Enovix come in. Silicon anodes seem likely to be available for incorporation in many smartphones in just a couple of years, but Apple and other smartphone developers aren\u2019t talking about them\u2014or really any battery. Why the silence? In part it\u2019s because Apple and its rivals don\u2019t want to call attention to the reality that \u201cAI features make efficiency go down,\u201d said Gene Berdichevsky, CEO of Sila Nanotechnologies, a silicon anode developer.  Krewell said that Apple appears to be betting that at this stage its iPhone users will just try out the device\u2019s AI capability, and not subject it to a beating. He called it \u201ccasual use of AI, which is, you ask, \u2018What\u2019s my schedule for today and what do I have to keep aware of?\u2019 And it runs through a quick list, does a crunch, gives you a result. And that\u2019s probably good for a while.\u201d Even if that\u2019s the case, it seems unlikely that this casual stage will last long: Power AI users will emerge, and gamers will push the devices to their limits. There is no doubt that Apple will need better batteries\u2014but how much better? Will the company need what Enovix is offering? \u201cWith the new [chips] that are less power hungry,\u201d said Cowen\u2019s Daoud, \u201cthe need for a better battery in the consumer world may not materialize to the level previously thought.\u201d \u2014-  Noteworthy  Tesla CEO Elon Musk said battery prices have fallen so low that they are no longer the bottleneck in producing a low-priced Tesla. Investors have pushed Musk, who made his remarks during Tesla\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting Thursday, to deliver a $25,000 EV. Batteries are generally thought to be the single most expensive component in an EV, and so economizing efforts often focus on them. But Musk said that batteries are relatively cheap now. Instead, he called the quest for a low-priced EV a battle of pennies\u2014an EV has 10,000 individual parts, and Tesla needs to squeeze the cost of every one of them. Europe imposed substantial tariffs on Chinese EV imports. The EU slapped provisional tariffs ranging from 27% to 48% on Chinese EVs. The lowest tariffs went to Byd and Geely, the carmakers that cooperated most completely with an EU investigation into Chinese subsidies, the EU said. The highest went to state-owned SAIC Motor, which apparently didn\u2019t cooperate much. A U.S. corruption watchdog opened an investigation into United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who allegedly retaliated against two lieutenants for refusing to approve certain expenditures he sought. The watchdog alleged that the union had dragged its heels in complying with document requests. Fain denied the allegations. Steve LeVine is editor of The Electric. Previously, he worked at Axios, Quartz and Medium, and before that The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.

        "heading": "Trump\u2019s Young Man in Silicon Valley",
        "author_name": "Margaux MacColl",
        "publish_date": "Jun 21, 2024, 9:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "Soon after a Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty of falsifying business records last month, the former president headed uptown to a restaurant, where a dinner party awaited him. Trump, who appeared unfazed by the conviction, walked in with a smile on his face, greeted by about 20 supporters and members of his innermost circle. The crowd included his son Eric, longtime ally and billionaire John Catsimatidis and a more recent addition to the crew, Palantir adviser Jacob Helberg. The group dined on a choice of steak or fish and threw out suggestions for vice president. It was at least the third time Helberg, who has donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s campaign, had been in the same room with the candidate in the last several months. \u201cI believe that conviction was 100% political,\u201d said Helberg, 34, when I met him at the Waldorf Astoria in Washington, a week after the trial. (He declined to discuss the dinner\u2019s details.) In a presidential election year marked by stark division, Helberg has emerged from the sidelines of politics and tech as a rising GOP power broker with a rare ability to flow between different worlds\u2014acting as a link between Silicon Valley and Washington while holding sway with liberals and conservatives alike. For a time, he existed mostly out of the limelight, serving on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a little-known but decades-old group created by Congress to monitor trade between the two countries. As part of that role, he would meet with policymakers like Republican Congressman Steve Scalise every few weeks to push for a ban on TikTok, the hit social media app critics have blasted as a national security threat based on its ties to China. Then in May he vaulted to greater attention when his annual Hill and Valley Forum attracted national headlines for the first time. As its name suggests, the event is a conclave for Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill leaders, and this year it concentrated on artificial intelligence and, naturally, China. Speakers came from both sides of the aisles\u2014senators including Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Cory Booker\u2014while Helberg leveraged his Palantir connections to get CEO Alex Karp on the stage, too. A pre-recorded Trump video closed out the day. The Washington elite liked the event, and it \u201carrived at a crucial time,\u201d when Silicon Valley and Washington must \u201cdevelop consensus about how to encourage innovation while keeping Americans safe,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement to The Information. The powerful in Silicon Valley liked it, too. \u201cJacob saw a gulf between what happens in Silicon Valley and in D.C. and took the initiative to bring these communities together,\u201d said Roelof Botha, managing partner of Sequoia Capital. \u201cHe has a very simple, disarming style,\u201d venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, a prominent Silicon Valley Democrat who appeared at the latest Hill and Valley Forum, said of Helberg. \u201cHis style helps a lot in getting people together,\u201d added Khosla, who said Helberg has a knack for seeing what both parties can agree on\u2014for example, concerns about China. As Trump tries to win a return to the White House, he is attempting to wrestle back support from the business elites\u2014backing that evaporated over the course of two impeachments, an insurrection and a global pandemic. (He even lost Peter Thiel: The billionaire offered hefty support to Trump in his first White House run and funded Trump prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in 2020 but has declined to give anything to GOP candidates this year.) Just a week ago, though, Trump made a rare trip to San Francisco for a pricey fundraiser thrown by \u201cAll In\u201d podcast co-host David Sacks. Helberg attended. \u201cIt was amazing to see that so many people in the Bay Area are now willing to support the president\u2019s election campaign,\u201d Helberg said. Biden still maintains a wide swath of support in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley and other parts of corporate America. He has done his own Bay Area fundraisers and has deployed Hollywood billionaire Jeff Katzenberg to help him collect more money. Nonetheless, Republicans see an opportunity to win more support from tech leaders who are dissatisfied with the Biden administration, and especially with his Federal Trade Commission chair, Lina Khan. Helberg, a onetime Democrat and former Google policy adviser who is married to venture capitalist Keith Rabois, is already playing an increasing role in that GOP courtship of Silicon Valley. And should Trump prevail, he is well positioned to catapult to even greater influence. When Helberg travels from the home he shares with Rabois in Miami to Washington, he prefers to stay at the Waldorf Astoria on Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the White House (a fitting locale considering Trump used to operate a hotel in the same location). I met him there shortly after Trump\u2019s conviction at Helberg\u2019s invitation to see \u201chow the sausage gets made,\u201d as he put it, grinning. We found each other in the hotel\u2019s glass-roofed lobby. Helberg, a can of Celsius energy drink in his hand, politely urged us to go: He didn\u2019t want to be late for a meeting with Rep. Scalise. So we piled into a sleek black SUV and zoomed toward the Capitol Building. There, a Scalise staffer ushered us through a side door, then up a spiral staircase to Scalise\u2019s office, where we found a coterie of young staffers in dark suits spread out on two striped yellow couches. Everyone was angled toward two leather chairs reserved for Scalise and Helberg. A photo of Trump sat on a nearby mantel. The contents of the meetings were off the record, although Helberg is happy to repeat his three main talking points later on the record. First and foremost, he makes it clear that he\u2019s there to represent Trump\u2019s interests, which include concern about how AI can be used to manipulate video and images in deceptive ways. \u201cHe\u2019s concerned about the potential for deep fakes to be exploited,\u201d he said. \u201cHe joked that there were deepfakes of him endorsing a commercial brand that he never endorsed that was completely impossible to differentiate from the real Trump.\u201d Second, Helberg emphasized that if policymakers pushed for immigration reform that allowed more highly skilled workers to stay in the country, they could \u201cactually activate a lot of Silicon Valley.\u201d And third, Helberg is very, very concerned about China-made humanoid robots. He warns anyone who will listen about Unitree Robotics, a Chinese company that has produced a $16,000 humanlike robot. Helberg is particularly struck by how Unitree\u2019s website claims its higher-end $90,000 robot can run as fast as 11 miles per hour. Although the robots are advertised for consumer use, he thinks they could be used for warfare. \u201cYou would have these things fighting in a battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you need a humanoid to run that fast?\u201d After meeting with Scalise, Helberg walks away convinced he can sell Congress on preventing a robot invasion. As we descended a stone staircase, Helberg began to spitball ideas for forestalling such a scenario with his new chief of staff, Jordan Dunn, who was previously communications director for former Rep. Mike Gallagher. (Gallagher in turn has since reportedly taken a plum gig at Palantir.) Maybe they could maneuver a \u201cfederal ban on Chinese humanoids\u201d into the next National Defense Authorization Act, Helberg said, the U.S.\u2019s largest annual defense bill. Between meetings, we left the Capitol\u2019s marbled halls and headed down to its fluorescent-lit canteen. Sitting at a long cafeteria table, Helberg told me about his childhood in Paris, where he lived until moving to Brussels at age 11. His father, a psychiatrist, is American and the son of Holocaust survivors; his mother, a web programmer, is French and the daughter of Resistance fighters. His parents, both Jewish, met in Israel in the 1980s. \u201cThe [stories] of both their families were the product of Jewish persecution, in a way,\u201d he said. Helberg, who holds both French and American citizenship, studied international affairs as a George Washington University undergraduate before enrolling in the SciencesPo Law School in Paris for all of one semester. It took one visit to a large law firm to make Helberg realize he had \u201cno interest in being a career attorney.\u201d So Helberg decided to follow an older sister to Los Angeles. He was there for less than a year before friends in Silicon Valley convinced him to move up north. He was quickly swept into the tech world, briefly co-founding a breast cancer screening startup and working for GeoQuant, a software company that used data to measure geopolitical issues, such as the stability of governments. Along the way, he found Rabois. The two first met in 2015, at TechCrunch\u2019s Crunchies awards. \u201cI thought he was really interesting and pretty mysterious,\u201d Helberg recalled. \u201cI had no idea that he was a ruby-red Republican.\u201d A few dates in, Helberg, then a proud Democrat, praised the Clintons, unaware that Rabois had previously worked with Ken Starr, who, of course, had led Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment. \u201cHe just kind of looked at me, smiled and said, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re really a Clinton groupie,\u2019\u201d Helberg recalled with a laugh. About two years later, Helberg proposed. The two married beside the ocean in St. Barts. In the lead-up to the big day, Helberg filled an entire hotel room with five racks of bespoke suits: \u201cHe owned more clothes than the rest of the group combined,\u201d Delian Asparouhov, a Founders Fund partner and Rabois prot\u00e9g\u00e9, recalled with a laugh. In addition to Asparouhov, other wedding guests included OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, Stripe\u2019s Patrick Collison and Founders Fund founder Peter Thiel. About a year and a half after his fateful meeting with Rabois, Helberg left the startup world for Google in 2016 to work on the company\u2019s global search product and news policy. Joining a big tech company back then \u201cfelt like going to Florence during the Renaissance,\u201d Helberg recalled. But that gleam almost immediately tarnished. Helberg became fascinated and horrified by how foreign governments were exploiting U.S. technology; the world was laser focused on Russian interference in 2016, but Helberg believed the problem was much greater. \u201cRussia was the first mover. Iran and China quickly followed, and today I would argue China\u2019s probably the biggest player,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they have state media outlets that are on all of our platforms, including Twitter and Instagram and so forth.\u201d It was a wake-up call for Helberg, propelling his career toward Washington with stints at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which skews centrist. During our discussion in the cafeteria, as Helberg was narrating the story of his awakening about China, he realized we needed to get going.  We headed to a meeting with Rep. Jay Obernolte, a Republican who heads the House of Representatives\u2019 AI task force, followed by one with Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer\u2019s team. Helberg has been coming to Capitol Hill for such meetings every few weeks for the last three years. Originally, he came to lobby for the TikTok ban. More recently, he has shifted to AI policy, pushing for more AI integration into the military through providers like Palantir, as well as a tougher stance on China, with a goal of stunting the country\u2019s AI capabilities. \u201cLook, some people aren\u2019t huge fans of tariffs, but I think people are basically bought in at this point to the basic idea that China\u2019s a major geopolitical threat,\u201d he said. \u201cSo very few people push back when you say, \u2018We need to decouple from China.\u2019 I get less and less pushback every passing year.\u201d Once Helberg wrapped up his meetings, we finished the day at The Capital Grille, drawing up chairs in the darkly lit steakhouse at a table beneath a stuffed ram\u2019s head. As Helberg began to sit down, he popped up to greet Megan Milam, senior vice president of government relations at Anduril, Palmer Luckey\u2019s defense tech unicorn. A few minutes later, he returned, ordered a steak and recounted the moment that firmly pushed him from seemingly lifelong Democrat to staunch Republican. In 2021, he penned \u201cThe Wires of War,\u201d a Simon & Schuster\u2013published book about foreign adversaries using technology to wage war against the U.S. Republican Kevin McCarthy, then the House\u2019s minority leader, was a fan and displayed it in his office. \u201cHe and I had a very long dinner, actually, in this restaurant,\u201d Helberg said, motioning around the mahogany-lined room, \u201cwhere he basically convinced me to switch parties.\u201d At the time, any notoriety Helberg had in political circles was for throwing money behind Pete Buttigieg\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. But he had become frustrated by the younger generation of Democrats seemingly skewing further and further left, as well as the rise of anti-meritocratic ideology. \u201cI was on the fence at the time, and I told [McCarthy], \u2018Look, I\u2019m concerned that if I switch parties, the Democrats will forever resent me and Republicans won\u2019t trust me,\u201d Helberg said. \u201cHe convinced me to do it and take a leap of faith.\u201d Helberg went all-in on the GOP, working hard to get Republican and Silicon Valley leaders in the same room. That included Palantir\u2019s Karp, whom Helberg had met through a friend when Helberg was still in high school in Brussels. In 2023, Karp, inspired by Helberg\u2019s rising political profile, asked him to come on as a policy adviser. Helberg reports directly to Karp, calling him every other day or so. \u201cI basically help inform the company on how the public policy landscape is changing in D.C. in light of big-picture trends,\u201d Helberg said. He emphasized that Palantir was founded in the wake of 9/11 and capitalized on the government\u2019s laser focus on preventing terror attacks. Now, Helberg said, the government is struggling with the \u201cgreat power competition\u201d with China. His role is to help Karp and the company figure out, \u201cWhat does that mean from a policy standpoint in Washington? What does that mean for Palantir\u2019s strategy?\u201d As my French onion soup arrived, the conversation shifted again to Trump. \u201cA true love story,\u201d Helberg laughed. \u201cWe just can\u2019t stay away from each other.\u201d Trump and Helberg first met in late 2023, at a Mar-a-Lago event hosted by the America First Policy Institute, a right-wing think tank. \u201cI was really blown away with the energy in the room,\u201d Helberg said. \u201cThe events in Mar-a-Lago are just a lot more fun than the traditional cookie-cutter Democratic event.\u201d He liked Trump\u2019s unscripted nature, his charisma and his hawkishness on China. Helberg donated $100,000 in February 2024 to attend a Mar-a-Lago roundtable with other donors; he used his allotted speaking time to advocate for tariffs on China, backing Israel and border security. \u201cHe loves tariffs,\u201d Helberg said. In fact, Helberg said, the former president joked with him that \u201cthe most beautiful words in the English language are tariffs.\u201d The two then had a one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower in New York in April and also saw each other at Formula One\u2019s Miami Grand Prix. In Miami, Helberg attended the race with his husband, Rabois. (Rabois was a major supporter of two other Republican 2024 contenders: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former North Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.) Helberg said his time with Trump has given him an opportunity \u201cto look my friends in the eye and tell them I\u2019ve met the guy, I\u2019ve talked to him, and I really believe that he should be the next leader of our country,\u201d Helberg said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just hard to do that if you\u2019re operating just off\u2026hearsay and TV.\u201d I asked if his Trumpism has put off any friends in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley. \u201cI was prepared to lose friends,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve actually been struck at how little pushback I\u2019ve received. And I think it\u2019s really a sign of the times. There\u2019s something in the air.\u201d Two days later, he was in San Francisco for Sacks\u2019 Trump fundraiser. A week after our day together in Washington, Helberg returned to town to meet with Rep. Scalise yet again. I found him once more holed up at the Waldorf Astoria, prepping for his day on the Hill. I asked what the future held for him. He gave a simple answer: Get Trump elected, no matter what the cost. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take anything off the table, including providing him with more resources or hosting events for him,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever the campaign asks.\u201d An earlier version of this story misspelled billionaire John Catsimatidis's name.

        "author_name": "Stephanie Palazzolo",

        "body_content": "The old adage that you should never get into a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel load doesn\u2019t resonate in the digital age as well as it used to. But there\u2019s no doubt news publishers\u2019 complaints about AI startups pirating their copyrighted material has drawn plenty of coverage.  There may be a solution. A growing number of startups are emerging to try and help publishers, and other content owners, figure out how to maximize the money they can make from licensing their material to AI firms. Firms like New York City-based TollBit and London-based Human Native AI have devised technological solutions to help publishers, which otherwise are stuck negotiating one-off content licensing deals that many in the industry worry will haunt publishers in future years. What gives these startups reason to think they can help publishers make more AI-related money is that AI firms are already spending a lot of money to get data for training their large language models or making sure their LLMs can reference up-to-date information, not always legitimately. For instance, a multi-billion dollar industry of web scraping firms are now selling data they\u2019ve scraped from publishers\u2019 sites to some LLM developers and AI search engines. Human Native and TollBit want to convince AI companies to stop paying scraping firms, and to spend that money paying content owners on a recurring basis, as opposed to the licensing deals now getting done, which often aren\u2019t that generous to content owners. The two are taking different approaches. Human Native AI is building a data marketplace where publishers can upload their content in a form that has been cleaned up and suitable for AI training. AI companies can pay a fee to access the data. Publishers get a recurring subscription fee or a cut of the AI companies\u2019 revenue. Meanwhile, TollBit is more focused on helping publishers and content creators understand when their content is accessed by AI companies\u2019 bots. The startup helps news publishers create a copy of their site that bots are automatically directed to when they need to reference up-to-date information that\u2019s not already contained in an AI model (otherwise known as \u201cretrieval augmented generation.\u201d) The AI companies then pay rights holders a fee every time their bots access their content. These approaches aren\u2019t perfect. With AI startups like Adept developing autonomous agents that can navigate the web like humans do\u2014scrolling, making Google searches and clicking on buttons\u2014it could get more difficult for firms like TollBit to distinguish human site visitors from bots. And while these startups might help facilitate connections between publishers and AI companies or help publishers get paid when AI search engines reference their work to answer questions from users, none of them have a good answer for how much publishers should be charging for the content that\u2019s used during the model training process.  That\u2019s complicated further by contradicting signals from AI firms. Even while OpenAI shells out millions to strike deals with publishers, its CEO Sam Altman has made comments in the past like, \u201cWe actually don\u2019t need to train on [the New York Times\u2019] data\u2026Any one particular training source, it doesn\u2019t move the needle for us that much.\u201d Here\u2019s what else is going on\u2026 It\u2019s not every day that you get an inside look into the mind of one of the earliest backers of OpenAI. Luckily for you, the latest episode of \u201cMore or Less\u201d has exactly that, with an interview with prolific investor Vinod Khosla.

        "body_content": "Within days of taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden reversed a decision by the Trump administration to lift sanctions on one of the most controversial Western mining executives in central Africa. Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler didn\u2019t merit a reprieve, Biden\u2019s State Department said, alleging that in a two-year period he had corruptly siphoned off more than $1.3 billion in mining profits that rightfully belonged to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Last month, though, the Biden administration reportedly offered to let Gertler mostly off the hook\u2014as long as he leaves the DRC and makes way for U.S. companies to mine the nation\u2019s rich reserves of cobalt and copper, metals vital to the electric vehicle and battery industries.  In the deal, Gertler would sell three big DRC cobalt-copper mines to the country\u2019s government for roughly $300 million and pull out of the DRC permanently, opening the door for U.S. or other Western companies to step in. In exchange, the U.S. would loosen sanctions on Gertler, allowing Western banks to work with him without penalty, according to multiple media accounts. The proposal marks a new chapter of the U.S. attempt to erode China\u2019s massive dominance of the EV and battery industries, and illustrates the compromises that the U.S. is prepared to make to compete. It\u2019s not clear how Gertler has responded\u2014he did not reply to an email seeking comment, and Biden administration officials declined to comment. But the proposal highlights the intensifying geopolitical battle over crucial minerals for EVs and batteries:  Combined, the moves suggest that, despite cooling EV sales growth in the U.S., Western industry and government players are acting aggressively to advance difficult and sometimes controversial EV, battery and mining projects. They have to, since China is showing it intends to maintain its wide competitive lead. What a Country Takeover Looks Like China\u2019s push into Morocco looks like a takeover: Over the last year or so, six Chinese companies have outlined plans or signed contracts to invest roughly $10 billion in nickel- and iron-led battery and component gigafactories in the country, according to Rho Motion, a U.K.-based EV industry research firm. Morocco is a choice location because it neighbors Europe and has free-trade agreements with both the U.S. and Europe, positioning the Chinese companies to export to both markets. Though the plants will make both nickel-manganese-cobalt and LFP batteries, Morocco is especially attractive for LFP manufacturers because it has more than 70% of the world\u2019s phosphate, a key ingredient of the battery.  Today, Chinese companies produce virtually all of the world\u2019s LFP batteries. Western automakers are shifting toward LFP because it is cheaper and faces fewer supply chain issues, as we have reported.  That leaves both U.S. and European automakers scrambling to arrange LFP supplies. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any supply chain. This has to be set up,\u201d Sebastian Wolf, chief operating officer for PowerCo, VW\u2019s battery-making subsidiary, said in a June 19 speech in Germany. A cautionary note that not everything involving global mining concerns is as it seems: For months, industry and government hands have taken note of lithium project announcements in Nigeria that appear to involve some of China\u2019s largest companies\u00ad, under the names of Ganfeng Lithium Industry, Tianqi Lithium Industrial and Ningde Era Industrial (the latter\u2019s Chinese characters spell out CATL, the name of the world\u2019s largest battery company). By all appearances it seemed that China was making a run at the market of yet another country. Until it didn\u2019t. Bloomberg reporters, noticing slight idiosyncrasies in the company names (Ganfeng usually calls itself simply Ganfeng Lithium; likewise, Tianqi is usually simply Tianqi Lithium), called the corporate headquarters of all three companies in China. It turned out that Chinese nationals unconnected with any of them had set up these similarly named but unrelated operations in Nigeria. So while it\u2019s true that Chinese companies are aggressively launching lithium processing businesses in Nigeria, they are not the same ones that have cornered so much of the world\u2019s lithium supply elsewhere. Either way, one quality that Morocco and Nigeria share is that, as far as I can tell, they have no active American or European battery or materials companies. That\u2019s basically what the DRC looks like now as well. It holds three-quarters of the world\u2019s cobalt reserves\u201480% of them controlled by Chinese companies. But things didn\u2019t start out that way.  In 1970, the Nixon administration, noting the remarkably high concentration of cobalt, copper and uranium reserves in the DRC\u2019s soil, went to extraordinary lengths to snatch mining rights away from concerns out of Belgium, which had given up colonial control of the country only a decade earlier. After a full-court U.S. diplomatic press that included Nixon himself, the rights went to a U.S. diamond tycoon, Maurice Tempelsman. Though the U.S. was the most influential foreign commercial actor in the country, it would be almost three decades before an American company began mining there at scale. The company to do so was Freeport-McMoRan, which\u2014dazzled by metals visible at the earth\u2019s surface\u2014signed contracts in the late 1990s for majority rights to two major copper-cobalt deposits. A decade later, the company was earning enormous profits from one of the deposits\u2014Tenke Fungurume. In the latter half of the 2010s, however, ill-conceived investments in the oil industry pushed Freeport-McMoRan to the edge of insolvency. To reduce its debt, it sold Tenke Fungurume in 2016 for $2.65 billion; four years later, it sold Kisanfu, its second copper-cobalt property, for $550 million. In both cases, the buyer was China\u2019s CMOC Group. There simply were no other bidders. Another foreigner was poking around in the country, however: Gertler, who had parlayed a friendship with the country\u2019s former leader into large ownership stakes in several local copper-cobalt mines. Today, the DRC and many of its mines face criticism for their use of child labor and loose environmental practices. Still, the U.S.\u2014with batteries finally at the core of its thinking after years of diplomatic negligence\u2014would like back into the DRC.  The DRC itself has made it clear that it would like to be rid of Gertler, along with his legal problems and sweetheart mining deals. In just one incident, New York hedge fund Och-Ziff (now named Sculptor Capital Management) in 2016 paid $412 million in U.S. criminal and civil penalties for its part in an alleged massive bribery scheme involving Gertler in the DRC. The new proposed deal\u2014negotiated by senior administration officials in the State and Treasury Departments and the National Security Council\u2014faces opposition. International groups have urged the administration not to go through with it, as have four members of Congress\u2014two Democrats and two Republicans. But the administration seems to grasp what China did long ago\u2014that competing geopolitically often means working with some people and doing some things that you wouldn\u2019t at home. Otherwise, you don\u2019t get the metals.  --------- Noteworthy Two years late delivering EV batteries, Swedish battery-making startup Northvolt lost a $2.1 billion contract with BMW. The cancellation dealt a considerable blow to the prestige of Northvolt, which, launched by two Tesla veterans in 2017, had racked up $55 billion in orders, putting it in another class from rival startups that have scrounged for business. Now the BMW fiasco raises doubts about the rest of the orders. Toyota\u2014scorned by the rest of the industry for its slow development of EVs\u2014is doubling down on combustion engines. One of its latest products is a combustion engine much smaller than its current version, twinned with a hybrid battery. The outcome is expected to improve driving range by 12%, the Financial Times reported. Toyota may release cars featuring this powertrain around 2027. Prices of most battery metals have plunged 80% or more over the last year or so, but copper has risen 23% since this time in 2023\u2014though probably not for long. An enormous glut of the metal has built up in Chinese warehouses\u2014the biggest since before the pandemic. Already, copper prices have fallen 13% from their peak about a month ago, the FT reported ---  Recommended Newsletter Every weekday, The Briefing helps executives get smarter about the latest in tech, media and finance.

        "body_content": "Artificial intelligence companies increasingly seem to have adopted a product marketing approach modeled on that of cellphone plans. Anyone who uses Verizon should know what I mean: The cellphone firm has long offered an evolving array of plans, each with a slightly different name and offering slightly different options, forcing customers to spend way too much time figuring out which is which. Now the trend has hit AI. Anthropic released today what it describes as its \u201cmost intelligent\u201d large-language model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which joins Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3 Opus as part of the Claude \u201cfamily of models.\u201d  That family is denoted both by number (Claude 3.5 Sonnet replaced Claude 3 Sonnet) and with literary terms to denote functional differences. Haiku is \u201clight & fast\u201d while Sonnet is \u201chard-working\u201d and Opus is \u201cpowerful,\u201d according to Anthropic\u2019s website. Google has a similar approach, as a handy-dandy chart on its website demonstrates. Then there\u2019s OpenAI, which last month released GPT-4o, a name that at first glance looks like a typo.  But no, GPT-4o is OpenAI\u2019s \u201cnew flagship model,\u201d an advance on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We haven\u2019t seen GPT-4.5, by the way: Perhaps OpenAI\u2019s next release will be 4.5p!  There\u2019s plenty of precedent for this kind of thing in other sectors, including in Apple\u2019s hardware selection. While Steve Jobs famously simplified Apple\u2019s product lineup when he returned to the company in 1997, Tim Cook has introduced many different iterations of products. There\u2019s the iPad Pro (in two sizes), the iPad Air (also in two sizes), as well as the regular iPad and the iPad Mini. Apple even has four different versions of the pencil to go with the iPad. Who wins from these multifaceted product selections? Certainly not the customer, who has to wade through a variety of different product descriptions to try to figure out which version is the right one for their needs. Company executives may think offering a million versions of a product is the best way to broaden the market. It surely gives them a chance to upsell: If a customer likes product X but would like a tad more power, for instance, they can pay a few extra dollars to move up into a new tier of service. But offering too complicated a mix of products can turn off customers. That\u2019s likely true for AI firms, even if their customers are mostly developers right now. The best way for an AI startup to compete with bigger firms might be to not overcomplicate things with too many iterations. Otherwise, customers might give up and switch to the brand name they know, like OpenAI.  Sometimes more is less. Nvidia\u2019s reign as the most valuable company is over. Shares of the AI chipmaker fell 3.5% on Thursday, cutting its market cap to $3.2 trillion and putting it once again below Microsoft (worth $3.3 trillion).  As for the No. 2 slot, it\u2019s too close to call. Depending on the data source, Nvidia\u2019s market cap is either $3.217 trillion or $3.214 trillion. Apple is between those numbers, at $3.215 trillion.  Given how close these companies are, Nvidia may take the No. 1 slot again sometime soon.

        "heading": "A Former YC Partner Makes a Big Bet on Rapid Delivery",
        "author_name": "Kate Clark",
        "publish_date": "Jun 18, 2024, 3:05pm PDT",
        "body_content": "The last time I wrote about a startup\u2014outside artificial intelligence\u2014raising money at a higher valuation than in its last round was in May 2022, when blockchain analytics startup Chainalysis raised funds at an $8.6 billion valuation. That\u2019s why I was intrigued to hear about a round that doubled the valuation of Zepto, an Indian rapid-delivery company, in a round co-led by a new venture capital fund. Finally, some variety! The company, a graduate of Y Combinator that is headquartered in Mumbai, is expected to soon announce a new round of $660 million at a valuation of $3.6 billion, including the investment, according to two people involved in the round. The round\u2019s co-leads are DST Global and Avra, a new fund led by Anu Hariharan, a former Y Combinator partner whom Garry Tan laid off shortly after Tan took over the accelerator last year. This is Avra\u2019s first investment since it set out last year to raise $350 million for investing in growth-stage startups. It\u2019s a big bet on rapid delivery, companies that promise to deliver foods and other goods in under 10 minutes. These have been a costly disappointment to investors. Getir and Jokr have shut down their U.S. operations, and Gorillas sold to Getir, after they all racked up significant losses on deliveries and spent millions on big ad campaigns in an attempt to push each other out of the market. Some, like Fridge No More and Buyk, went bankrupt. But the potential for exponential growth in instant delivery in India, the world\u2019s most populous country, has reenergized some investors.  Indian cities are densely populated, making it easier for couriers to deliver to multiple households in quick concession. Also, big-box grocers aren\u2019t popular in India, as they are in suburban U.S. Instead, Indian shoppers also usually shop multiple times per week from mom-and-pop stores. Zepto is betting it can steal market share from these small local stores because of the convenience it offers.  Zepto buys goods in bulk and holds them in one of its 350 dark stores, distribution centers strategically placed across cities in India. Buyers order on the app from a dark store within a 2.5-kilometer distance.  Zepto was founded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, now both 21. Initially, it focused on selling fresh fruits and vegetables. To increase revenue, it\u2019s focusing on expanding its stock of more expensive, nongrocery items, like beauty products and cooking ware, so customers will spend more money on the app. It recently surpassed $1.3 billion in annualized sales, one of the people said. The Economic Times earlier reported on Zepto\u2019s funding talks.  With all the new cash, it plans to dramatically increase its number of dark stores, helping it deliver to more markets across India. The challenge for Zepto will be outpacing larger domestic rivals like Swiggy, Zomato and BigBasket, which also operate rapid-delivery services. Lightspeed Venture Partners, Avenir, Nexus Venture Partners, StepStone Group, Contrary and Glade Brook Capital also participated in Zepto\u2019s new round.  Hariharan will join the company\u2019s board as part of the deal. Last year she started working on Avra shortly after she abruptly lost her job at Y Combinator alongside Ali Rowghani, who also managed Y Combinator\u2019s late-stage fund. Now Hariharan wants to recreate the program she managed at Y Combinator through Avra. Avra offers a 7-week, free program to post\u2013Series A startups with the goal of helping those founders become better CEOs. Hariharan has already completed two batches of the program, graduating companies including AI video startups HeyGen and Runway. It goes to show that no deal story is ever complete without a mention of AI.  Kate Clark is deputy bureau chief responsible for venture capital coverage at The Information.

        "heading": "Europe-U.S. Tech Regulatory Battle Opens New Front",
        "author_name": "Martin Peers",
        "publish_date": "Jun 24, 2024, 5:00pm PDT",
        "body_content": "Students of history will recall the Hundred Years\u2019 War between England and France in the 1300s and 1400s. It feels like we\u2019re in the early stages of a second Hundred Years\u2019 War, this time pitting U.S. tech firms against the European Commission. On Monday, the commission opened a new front in that war by issuing \u201cpreliminary findings\u201d that Apple has breached the Digital Markets Act, one of the newish bits of legislation governing big tech firms in Europe. The decision is just the start of what could be a wave of such rulings against big tech, which should surely bolster guarantees of lifetime employment for European antitrust lawyers.  In addition to Apple, the European Commission said in March it was also investigating Alphabet and Meta Platforms over whether they\u2019re complying with the new law. Meanwhile, it is gathering facts about Amazon\u2019s compliance. For anyone who has lost track of the intricacies of European antitrust law\u2014that would be most sane people\u2014the EU introduced the DMA and a companion Digital Services Act to give the European Commission more power to police U.S. tech firms. The European antitrust czars have been on the trail of U.S. tech for years, of course\u2014they fined Google back in 2017 for antitrust breaches. But as we explained in this 2020 story, that investigation took years to complete and didn\u2019t do enough, in the eyes of some rivals. The Europeans are moving quicker now\u2014the law only came into force in early March (although it was debated for years before that). But it\u2019s still a multistep process: Today\u2019s ruling, for instance, begins a new phase in which Apple gets to defend itself. The penalties of the new law are extraordinarily steep\u2014up to 10% of a company\u2019s global revenue, which in Apple\u2019s case would be $38 billion, rising to 20% \u201cin case of repeated infringements.\u201d It seems hard to believe the commission would apply the full penalty, but when it comes to the Europeans, nothing can be ruled out. It makes sense that the Apple case is the first under the new law: The complaint against the iPhone maker may be the strongest the regulator has against any of the companies. It\u2019s aimed at Apple\u2019s App Store rules, specifically those dictating how developers can tell consumers about ways to pay for stuff they buy in the app without using Apple\u2019s payment method. Apple has been defending these rules for years, in forums around the world\u2014they\u2019re part of the U.S. antitrust suit filed against the company in March, for instance.  Changes Apple unveiled to the App Store rules in January to respond to the Digital Markets Act likely made things worse. While those alterations allowed for alternative app marketplaces, the company simultaneously instituted new fees, which the Europeans today said they were investigating to see if they complied with the law. Apple claims its rules are simply designed to protect user security, although the real reason is surely the money the App Store brings in, which we suspect is far more important to Apple\u2019s bottom line than is apparent from its publicly available financial statements. For that reason, Apple will likely fight this as long as it can.  And for the European regulators, this kind of thing is their raison d\u2019\u00eatre. They won\u2019t back down. Six days ago, Nvidia became the most valuable company by market capitalization, a triumph that lasted all of 24 hours. It turns out that was the peak for the stock, at least for the moment. Last Tuesday, the day of its ascent to top-dog status, Nvidia stock closed at $135.58.  Nvidia stock has fallen every trading day since then, sliding 6.7% on Monday alone to close at $118.11 (and it fell further in after-hours trading).  The 12.8% drop has cut Nvidia\u2019s market cap to $2.9 trillion, down from $3.34 trillion. Now the question is, how far will it fall before it stabilizes?

        "body_content": "Chinese tech companies are facing more scrutiny in the U.S. than ever before. Yet some of China\u2019s artificial intelligence startups are making a rush to grab U.S. customers. The reason: it\u2019s too hard to make any money in China. One example is Beijing-based Moonshot AI, one of China\u2019s most valuable AI startups. Its employees have been working on products that were recently launched in the U.S., including Ohai, an AI role-play chat app available on the Apple and Google mobile app stores, and the website of Noisee, a music video generator, according to an employee and another person briefed on the moves. The U.S. entry by Moonshot, which is on track for a $3 billion valuation, shows how Chinese AI startups are responding to an escalating price war in their domestic market for large-language models and AI applications. Its U.S. efforts haven\u2019t previously been reported. MiniMax, one of Moonshot\u2019s main Chinese rivals, has already expanded in the U.S. with Talkie, an AI chat app. Talkie, which some users have compared to Menlo Park, Calif.\u2013based Character.AI, had 11.4 million monthly active users in the U.S. for iOS and Android combined as of May, nearly triple the figure for April, according to data from digital intelligence platform Similarweb. Moonshot, whose main product in China is a popular AI text chatbot, Kimi, is also working on developing an international version of Kimi for users outside China, the people said. It isn\u2019t yet clear when the startup might launch the overseas chatbot, which may not necessarily have the same name as the Chinese one, according to the people. Moonshot, meanwhile, has hired some employees in the U.S. and continues to recruit more talent there. A Moonshot spokesperson in China didn\u2019t answer questions about Ohai or Noisee. \u201cWe currently have no plans to develop or release any products overseas,\u201d the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The websites of Ohai and Noisee show that both products belong to a Sunnyvale, Calif.\u2013based company, Tranquillitatis. California\u2019s registration documents for Tranquillitatis show its sole director is Yuxin Wu, which is the same name as that of one of Moonshot AI\u2019s co-founders. (Tranquillitatis is the name of a basin on the moon; Moonshot\u2019s Chinese company name, Yue Zhi An Mian, means \u201cthe dark side of the moon.\u201d) Ohai offers users a chance to interact with characters from movies and TV shows such as \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d in a virtual chat with a preset plotline (in one exchange, the user plays an intern who just had an \u201cimpromptu night\u201d with surgical heartthrob Dr. Derek Shepherd and is trying to navigate first day of work). Both products are in beta. Ohai only had about 2,000 monthly active users in the U.S. on Android phones in May, according to Similarweb. Noisee, which doesn\u2019t have a mobile app, had about 34,300 visitors to its website in May. China\u2019s crowded AI market is fueling the international ambitions of Chinese AI startups. Dozens of startups and large tech companies in the country have launched LLMs. Recently they have been undercutting each other\u2019s prices in what could be a race to the bottom. Last month, tech giants Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and ByteDance all lowered the fees they charge customers for use of their LLMs, and earlier this month, Zhipu AI, one of China\u2019s leading AI startups, cut the price for the most affordable version of its LLM to just 0.1 yuan per 1 million tokens, according to local media reports. Moonshot AI, which released the first version of its Kimi chatbot in China in October, only added a paid premium service to it last month. Moonshot is one of the best-funded AI startups in China. Founded last year by several prominent Chinese AI researchers who had studied and worked in the U.S., the startup raised $1 billion from Alibaba and other investors in February. Last month, The Information reported that Moonshot was in talks to raise yet another funding round from investors including WeChat operator Tencent. Moonshot is dipping its toes in the U.S. market at a sensitive time. Chinese-owned internet products that have become popular in the U.S., such as ByteDance\u2019s TikTok, are facing growing scrutiny from American lawmakers due to concerns that China\u2019s government could access U.S. user data or influence online content for propaganda purposes. President Joe Biden signed a new law in April that will ban TikTok if it doesn\u2019t cut ties with ByteDance in a year, and TikTok sued the government to block the law. If Chinese-owned generative AI apps ever become very popular in the U.S., they also could come under scrutiny from the same lawmakers who have supported the TikTok legislation.

        "body_content": "Big brands are really coming around to influencer marketing after years of only dabbling in it, I reported in this story on Friday. The shift is causing even 187-year-old John Deere to rethink its marketing plans.  In April, the company announced it would hire a creator to run its short-form video strategy for a one-year contract that pays $200,000. This new hire, dubbed the first \u201cchief tractor officer,\u201d will also collaborate with influencers, or even other brands. \u201cWe have to be able to grab people\u2019s attention in someone\u2019s feed,\u201d said Jennifer Hartmann, John Deere\u2019s global director of strategic public relations and enterprise social media, in an interview. \u201cWe need to show up in a way that is surprising, that is fresh, with people that are a great fit for our brand.\u201d  John Deere has previously linked up with social-media famous farmers, such as Zach Johnson, better known as Millennial Farmer, who has more than 1 million YouTube subscribers. The creators are a way of introducing the brand to more people ages 18 to 35.  \u201cThe world is becoming less and less rural, [and] much more urban. As kids leave rural areas, they\u2019re becoming more and more disconnected from farming, where their food comes from,\u201d Hartmann said. Part of the goal of the new creator\u2019s role at John Deere is to introduce on social media the way those industries impact people\u2019s day-to-day lives. The company also wants to appeal to viewers with quirky, but less well-known facts about its business, like that its equipment is used at Wrigley Field and at national parks. John Deere expects to announce the hire by the end of this month. Here\u2019s a look at how some other big brands are allocating their budgets: \u2022 Fanta, the fruit-flavored soda brand owned by Coca-Cola, is spending almost half of its budget for the relaunch of its \u201cWanta Fanta\u201d campaign on social media advertising, including a sizable portion for influencer marketing. Rather than reprising the famous jingle from the aughts on traditional television, the company brought it back on TikTok by hiring a group of Gen Z creators in the U.S. to remix, dance to and lip-sync to the song.  \u2022 Jack in the Box for its fiscal year that ended October 1st, increased its social media and creator budget by 52% compared to the previous year. Its current fiscal year is seeing that same spending level, or slightly higher, the company said.  \u2022 Bodyarmor, a sports drink Coca-Cola also owns, has also boosted its spending on social media advertising, including creator partnerships, to about a third of its total budget, up from 15% to 20% two years ago. The increase in the budget has been driven by deals with creators like Dude Perfect.  \u2022 Other long-time TV advertisers, including Priceline and Allstate are now making strategic bets on influencer marketing this year.  \u201cWe\u2019re in a moment now, where there is not a brand who would think: Influencer marketing is not for me,\u201d said Brandon Perlman, the founder and CEO of influencer marketing agency Social Studies. Here\u2019s what else is going on\u2026 \u201cI need you guys to use your influence, and it doesn\u2019t have to be boring. I don\u2019t expect you to have a bunch of charts and graphs,\u201d Former President Barack Obama told 80 creators during a fundraiser for President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign over the weekend in Los Angeles, according to Axios. \u201cI understand folks are swiping or scrolling, and you\u2019ve got to use humor and you\u2019ve got to use other things that are engaging people.\u201d Obama acknowledged that the creators in the room \u201cmay not agree with everything\u201d Biden does, but said the current president \u201cbelieves in the basic things that you believe in.\u201d Creators have been a key strategy in Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, as The Information previously reported. But some of Biden\u2019s recent efforts have fumbled, including a testy exchange over military funding to Israel between him and Jonathan M. Katz, an independent journalist and critic of his administration, at a reception for social media influencers at the White House in April. Katz later posted the moment on TikTok to his more than 70,000 followers. See The Information\u2019s Creator Economy Database for an exclusive list of private companies and their investors. TikTok announced a new tool for marketers to use AI-generated avatars to promote products in their ads. Marketers will be able to choose from a set of stock avatars, based on video of paid human actors, or create their own custom avatars based on a brand spokesperson or creator. The Information first reported on the effort earlier this year.  X is planning to announce plans for longer videos on the social network, as well as deals with content providers at the advertising conference Cannes Lions this week, according to the Financial Times.  Webtoon Entertainment, a digital comics site with 24 million creators and about 170 million active users, is eyeing a valuation of up to $2.67 billion in a U.S. initial public offering. It\u2019s aiming to raise as much as $315 million by offering 15 million shares between $18 and $21 per share.  Amazon is working with ad-buying agency GroupM to make it easier for people to shop for products on Amazon Live\u2019s free, ad supported TV channel. Danone will be the first brand to participate in the new shoppable shows. This fall Danone will sell its Silk\u2019s new dairy-free coffee creamers in videos where creators try and review the product on Amazon\u2019s FAST channel. Viewers can shop for the item on their phone by typing \u201cshop the show\u201d into the search bar of the Amazon Shopping app. They\u2019ll then see products seen on their TV screen and can add them to the cart to purchase.  AfterHour, a social trading app, raised $4.5 million in seed funding co-led by Founders Fund and General Catalyst. Kairos Group, a London-based creative agency and influencer marketing firm, raised an undisclosed amount of new funding from venture capital firm BGF and rebranded to NewGen.  Beacons, best known as a link-in-bio startup, released its second annual list of top creator agencies, which now includes more than 240 companies, up from 125 a year ago.  ICYMI: TikTok launched a video series called Off the Record that features top artists discussing the story behind their new albums. It kicked off last week with Meghan Trainor and other artists. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general, called for a warning label on social media apps in an opinion essay in the New York Times on Monday, which would state that \u201csocial media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency.\u201d  NBCUniversal is bringing 27 creators to the Paris Olympics in July to reach younger audiences. The media company worked with Meta Platforms, sports media company Overtime, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube to develop the program, which it\u2019s calling the Paris Creator Collective. \u201cFrom the athletes to the food to the celebration, creators will offer their communities of fans a truly unique, engaging look,\u201d said Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics, in a statement.  The Free Press, an independent, conservative media company started by former New York Times op-ed writer Bari Weiss, now counts more than 100,000 paying subscribers and nearly 700,000 subscribers total. An annual subscription costs $80 per year. Read our previous reporting on The Free Press.

        "body_content": "Mylene Mae has found success with turning short Reels on Instagram into a series of related videos. She\u2019s part of an emerging trend of creators doing so.  Mae, 24, first started posting last April, initially focusing on sharing long-form YouTube videos about her efforts to learn how to code and life as a recent college graduate. On YouTube, she hoped to hit 10,000 subscribers. Instead, she reached about 1,000 before changing course.  \u201cYouTube is really hard,\u201d said Mae, whose given last name is Tu. \u201cSo I pivoted into Instagram.\u201d  At the end of last year, she started posting a series of videos on Reels titled \u201c23 lessons from 2023,\u201d which spanned until April, where she touched on topics like how to effectively set goals or why to think twice before taking someone else\u2019s advice.  \u201cThe hardest thing about getting started is there are so many variables you cannot control, like you don\u2019t know what platform to use or editing tools to use or what style works or which niche,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a series helped me in the beginning, because I could focus on a centralized theme, but I could experiment within that constraint. People knew to expect a life lesson, but the style could change throughout the series.\u201d The sixth video of the series finally went viral, totaling about 3.5 million views. After that, she said her account jumped from 400 followers to 70,000 in the span of about a week. Now, she has nearly 170,000 followers on Instagram. Mae tried reposting those same videos to YouTube Shorts and TikTok, but would only get a few thousand views, a sliver of the attention they received on Instagram. Mae, who is based in Los Angeles, works full-time at a video-editing software startup, but also earns money as a creator, primarily through sponsorships with advertisers such as Adobe and laptop maker Asus.  The highest-profile example of short-form series succeeding came on TikTok, from Reesa Teesa, whose real name is Tareasa Johnson. Earlier this year, she shared a 50-part set of clips in five to ten minute increments on TikTok about her marriage gone wrong.  Mae\u2019s are even shorter, spanning about 40 seconds long. She thinks Instagram has an advantage over TikTok because it has built out a variety of other features that make it easier for creators to connect with fans, not just rack up views, including broadcast channels, which allow creators to chat with top fans in a group message. Meanwhile, direct messaging on TikTok hasn\u2019t taken off.  Up next, she is considering more mini series on different topics, which could be shorter with five videos or another 20-part project. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m playing around with different styles and types of editing,\u201d she said.  Here\u2019s what else is going on\u2026 See The Information\u2019s Creator Economy Database for an exclusive list of private companies and their investors. Omnicom, an ad holding company, partnered with Instacart to make it easier for users to shop ingredients needed for recipes or items for skincare routines from creators on the grocery shopping app.  Universal Music Group announced an agreement with AI music startup SoundLabs. The partnership allows UMG artists and producers to use the startup\u2019s AI feature MicDrop for actions like converting a human voice into instruments from humming a melody or making versions of their voices in different languages.  Pocket FM, an India-based startup offering audio series similar to podcasts as well as a writing service, partnered with ElevenLabs, an AI text to voice startup, so that writers can convert their written work into audio series.  Izea, a publicly-traded influencer marketing company, announced new features including the ability for creators to generate an AI version of their voice and then share that digital voice with their talent managers or brands for sponsorships.  HeyGen, an AI video generation startup, announced it raised $60 million in Series A funding led by Benchmark. The Information first reported about the fundraising efforts in March.  Daydream, an AI-powered search engine for e-commerce founded by Julie Bornstein, raised a $50 million seed round co-led by Forerunner Ventures and Index Ventures. Bornstein previously founded retail app The Yes, which Pinterest later acquired. Daydream will provide personalized shopping results for customers using generative AI. (We wrote about Bornstein as part of The Information\u2019s Free Agent series, tracking executives who have left companies.) Butterflies AI, a new social network for humans and AIs to \u201cco-exist,\u201d launched this week and announced $4.8 million in seed funding led by Coatue Management. The startup was founded by former longtime Snap engineer Vu Tran. Users create \u201cbutterflies,\u201d or AI personas with backstories, opinions and emotions, that automatically create posts that humans and other AIs can interact with.  Gracia AI announced a $1.2 million seed round led by Venture Reality Fund, which the startup will use to launch a YouTube-like platform for professional creators to share virtual reality content. TikTok said the new law forcing a sale or ban of the app in the U.S. should be overturned, according to a court brief on Thursday, the latest update in the legal battle over the app\u2019s future in the country. \u201cNever before has Congress silenced so much speech in a single act,\u201d the brief said, adding that it \u201csets a dangerous precedent allowing the political branches to target a disfavored speech platform and force it to sell or be shut down.\u201d The Texas Ethics Commission voted to require social media influencers to disclose when they are paid for political ads. Last year, The Texas Tribune reported that creators were quietly paid to support impeached Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian will launch a video podcast on X this fall as the platform tries to strike more original content deals. It\u2019s not clear what topics the podcast will focus on, but the deal comes as X has lost major advertisers.  A Touch More, a production company founded by former professional athletes Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe, is partnering with Vox Media to relaunch and expand their sports and pop culture podcast, A Touch More Live. The effort originally started as an Instagram Live series during the pandemic.    John Deere announced that Rex Curtiss, a TikTok creator and recent college graduate, will be its \u201cchief tractor officer,\u201d responsible for developing content for John Deere\u2019s social media accounts. (Read more about John Deere\u2019s strategy with the role here.)  Van Leeuwen Ice Cream is hiring a full-time content creator, based in Brooklyn, to take the ice cream company\u2019s \u201cdigital footprint to the next level,\u201d according to a job posting. The annual salary range is $70,000 to $80,000 per year, not including a bonus. Thank you for reading the Creator Economy Newsletter!

        "heading": "Trump\u2019s Young Man in Silicon Valley",
        "author_name": "Margaux MacColl",
        "publish_date": "Jun 21, 2024, 9:00am PDT",
        "body_content": "Soon after a Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty of falsifying business records last month, the former president headed uptown to a restaurant, where a dinner party awaited him. Trump, who appeared unfazed by the conviction, walked in with a smile on his face, greeted by about 20 supporters and members of his innermost circle. The crowd included his son Eric, longtime ally and billionaire John Catsimatidis and a more recent addition to the crew, Palantir adviser Jacob Helberg. The group dined on a choice of steak or fish and threw out suggestions for vice president. It was at least the third time Helberg, who has donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s campaign, had been in the same room with the candidate in the last several months. \u201cI believe that conviction was 100% political,\u201d said Helberg, 34, when I met him at the Waldorf Astoria in Washington, a week after the trial. (He declined to discuss the dinner\u2019s details.) In a presidential election year marked by stark division, Helberg has emerged from the sidelines of politics and tech as a rising GOP power broker with a rare ability to flow between different worlds\u2014acting as a link between Silicon Valley and Washington while holding sway with liberals and conservatives alike. For a time, he existed mostly out of the limelight, serving on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a little-known but decades-old group created by Congress to monitor trade between the two countries. As part of that role, he would meet with policymakers like Republican Congressman Steve Scalise every few weeks to push for a ban on TikTok, the hit social media app critics have blasted as a national security threat based on its ties to China. Then in May he vaulted to greater attention when his annual Hill and Valley Forum attracted national headlines for the first time. As its name suggests, the event is a conclave for Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill leaders, and this year it concentrated on artificial intelligence and, naturally, China. Speakers came from both sides of the aisles\u2014senators including Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Cory Booker\u2014while Helberg leveraged his Palantir connections to get CEO Alex Karp on the stage, too. A pre-recorded Trump video closed out the day. The Washington elite liked the event, and it \u201carrived at a crucial time,\u201d when Silicon Valley and Washington must \u201cdevelop consensus about how to encourage innovation while keeping Americans safe,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement to The Information. The powerful in Silicon Valley liked it, too. \u201cJacob saw a gulf between what happens in Silicon Valley and in D.C. and took the initiative to bring these communities together,\u201d said Roelof Botha, managing partner of Sequoia Capital. \u201cHe has a very simple, disarming style,\u201d venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, a prominent Silicon Valley Democrat who appeared at the latest Hill and Valley Forum, said of Helberg. \u201cHis style helps a lot in getting people together,\u201d added Khosla, who said Helberg has a knack for seeing what both parties can agree on\u2014for example, concerns about China. As Trump tries to win a return to the White House, he is attempting to wrestle back support from the business elites\u2014backing that evaporated over the course of two impeachments, an insurrection and a global pandemic. (He even lost Peter Thiel: The billionaire offered hefty support to Trump in his first White House run and funded Trump prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in 2020 but has declined to give anything to GOP candidates this year.) Just a week ago, though, Trump made a rare trip to San Francisco for a pricey fundraiser thrown by \u201cAll In\u201d podcast co-host David Sacks. Helberg attended. \u201cIt was amazing to see that so many people in the Bay Area are now willing to support the president\u2019s election campaign,\u201d Helberg said. Biden still maintains a wide swath of support in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley and other parts of corporate America. He has done his own Bay Area fundraisers and has deployed Hollywood billionaire Jeff Katzenberg to help him collect more money. Nonetheless, Republicans see an opportunity to win more support from tech leaders who are dissatisfied with the Biden administration, and especially with his Federal Trade Commission chair, Lina Khan. Helberg, a onetime Democrat and former Google policy adviser who is married to venture capitalist Keith Rabois, is already playing an increasing role in that GOP courtship of Silicon Valley. And should Trump prevail, he is well positioned to catapult to even greater influence. When Helberg travels from the home he shares with Rabois in Miami to Washington, he prefers to stay at the Waldorf Astoria on Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the White House (a fitting locale considering Trump used to operate a hotel in the same location). I met him there shortly after Trump\u2019s conviction at Helberg\u2019s invitation to see \u201chow the sausage gets made,\u201d as he put it, grinning. We found each other in the hotel\u2019s glass-roofed lobby. Helberg, a can of Celsius energy drink in his hand, politely urged us to go: He didn\u2019t want to be late for a meeting with Rep. Scalise. So we piled into a sleek black SUV and zoomed toward the Capitol Building. There, a Scalise staffer ushered us through a side door, then up a spiral staircase to Scalise\u2019s office, where we found a coterie of young staffers in dark suits spread out on two striped yellow couches. Everyone was angled toward two leather chairs reserved for Scalise and Helberg. A photo of Trump sat on a nearby mantel. The contents of the meetings were off the record, although Helberg is happy to repeat his three main talking points later on the record. First and foremost, he makes it clear that he\u2019s there to represent Trump\u2019s interests, which include concern about how AI can be used to manipulate video and images in deceptive ways. \u201cHe\u2019s concerned about the potential for deep fakes to be exploited,\u201d he said. \u201cHe joked that there were deepfakes of him endorsing a commercial brand that he never endorsed that was completely impossible to differentiate from the real Trump.\u201d Second, Helberg emphasized that if policymakers pushed for immigration reform that allowed more highly skilled workers to stay in the country, they could \u201cactually activate a lot of Silicon Valley.\u201d And third, Helberg is very, very concerned about China-made humanoid robots. He warns anyone who will listen about Unitree Robotics, a Chinese company that has produced a $16,000 humanlike robot. Helberg is particularly struck by how Unitree\u2019s website claims its higher-end $90,000 robot can run as fast as 11 miles per hour. Although the robots are advertised for consumer use, he thinks they could be used for warfare. \u201cYou would have these things fighting in a battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you need a humanoid to run that fast?\u201d After meeting with Scalise, Helberg walks away convinced he can sell Congress on preventing a robot invasion. As we descended a stone staircase, Helberg began to spitball ideas for forestalling such a scenario with his new chief of staff, Jordan Dunn, who was previously communications director for former Rep. Mike Gallagher. (Gallagher in turn has since reportedly taken a plum gig at Palantir.) Maybe they could maneuver a \u201cfederal ban on Chinese humanoids\u201d into the next National Defense Authorization Act, Helberg said, the U.S.\u2019s largest annual defense bill. Between meetings, we left the Capitol\u2019s marbled halls and headed down to its fluorescent-lit canteen. Sitting at a long cafeteria table, Helberg told me about his childhood in Paris, where he lived until moving to Brussels at age 11. His father, a psychiatrist, is American and the son of Holocaust survivors; his mother, a web programmer, is French and the daughter of Resistance fighters. His parents, both Jewish, met in Israel in the 1980s. \u201cThe [stories] of both their families were the product of Jewish persecution, in a way,\u201d he said. Helberg, who holds both French and American citizenship, studied international affairs as a George Washington University undergraduate before enrolling in the SciencesPo Law School in Paris for all of one semester. It took one visit to a large law firm to make Helberg realize he had \u201cno interest in being a career attorney.\u201d So Helberg decided to follow an older sister to Los Angeles. He was there for less than a year before friends in Silicon Valley convinced him to move up north. He was quickly swept into the tech world, briefly co-founding a breast cancer screening startup and working for GeoQuant, a software company that used data to measure geopolitical issues, such as the stability of governments. Along the way, he found Rabois. The two first met in 2015, at TechCrunch\u2019s Crunchies awards. \u201cI thought he was really interesting and pretty mysterious,\u201d Helberg recalled. \u201cI had no idea that he was a ruby-red Republican.\u201d A few dates in, Helberg, then a proud Democrat, praised the Clintons, unaware that Rabois had previously worked with Ken Starr, who, of course, had led Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment. \u201cHe just kind of looked at me, smiled and said, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re really a Clinton groupie,\u2019\u201d Helberg recalled with a laugh. About two years later, Helberg proposed. The two married beside the ocean in St. Barts. In the lead-up to the big day, Helberg filled an entire hotel room with five racks of bespoke suits: \u201cHe owned more clothes than the rest of the group combined,\u201d Delian Asparouhov, a Founders Fund partner and Rabois prot\u00e9g\u00e9, recalled with a laugh. In addition to Asparouhov, other wedding guests included OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, Stripe\u2019s Patrick Collison and Founders Fund founder Peter Thiel. About a year and a half after his fateful meeting with Rabois, Helberg left the startup world for Google in 2016 to work on the company\u2019s global search product and news policy. Joining a big tech company back then \u201cfelt like going to Florence during the Renaissance,\u201d Helberg recalled. But that gleam almost immediately tarnished. Helberg became fascinated and horrified by how foreign governments were exploiting U.S. technology; the world was laser focused on Russian interference in 2016, but Helberg believed the problem was much greater. \u201cRussia was the first mover. Iran and China quickly followed, and today I would argue China\u2019s probably the biggest player,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they have state media outlets that are on all of our platforms, including Twitter and Instagram and so forth.\u201d It was a wake-up call for Helberg, propelling his career toward Washington with stints at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which skews centrist. During our discussion in the cafeteria, as Helberg was narrating the story of his awakening about China, he realized we needed to get going.  We headed to a meeting with Rep. Jay Obernolte, a Republican who heads the House of Representatives\u2019 AI task force, followed by one with Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer\u2019s team. Helberg has been coming to Capitol Hill for such meetings every few weeks for the last three years. Originally, he came to lobby for the TikTok ban. More recently, he has shifted to AI policy, pushing for more AI integration into the military through providers like Palantir, as well as a tougher stance on China, with a goal of stunting the country\u2019s AI capabilities. \u201cLook, some people aren\u2019t huge fans of tariffs, but I think people are basically bought in at this point to the basic idea that China\u2019s a major geopolitical threat,\u201d he said. \u201cSo very few people push back when you say, \u2018We need to decouple from China.\u2019 I get less and less pushback every passing year.\u201d Once Helberg wrapped up his meetings, we finished the day at The Capital Grille, drawing up chairs in the darkly lit steakhouse at a table beneath a stuffed ram\u2019s head. As Helberg began to sit down, he popped up to greet Megan Milam, senior vice president of government relations at Anduril, Palmer Luckey\u2019s defense tech unicorn. A few minutes later, he returned, ordered a steak and recounted the moment that firmly pushed him from seemingly lifelong Democrat to staunch Republican. In 2021, he penned \u201cThe Wires of War,\u201d a Simon & Schuster\u2013published book about foreign adversaries using technology to wage war against the U.S. Republican Kevin McCarthy, then the House\u2019s minority leader, was a fan and displayed it in his office. \u201cHe and I had a very long dinner, actually, in this restaurant,\u201d Helberg said, motioning around the mahogany-lined room, \u201cwhere he basically convinced me to switch parties.\u201d At the time, any notoriety Helberg had in political circles was for throwing money behind Pete Buttigieg\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. But he had become frustrated by the younger generation of Democrats seemingly skewing further and further left, as well as the rise of anti-meritocratic ideology. \u201cI was on the fence at the time, and I told [McCarthy], \u2018Look, I\u2019m concerned that if I switch parties, the Democrats will forever resent me and Republicans won\u2019t trust me,\u201d Helberg said. \u201cHe convinced me to do it and take a leap of faith.\u201d Helberg went all-in on the GOP, working hard to get Republican and Silicon Valley leaders in the same room. That included Palantir\u2019s Karp, whom Helberg had met through a friend when Helberg was still in high school in Brussels. In 2023, Karp, inspired by Helberg\u2019s rising political profile, asked him to come on as a policy adviser. Helberg reports directly to Karp, calling him every other day or so. \u201cI basically help inform the company on how the public policy landscape is changing in D.C. in light of big-picture trends,\u201d Helberg said. He emphasized that Palantir was founded in the wake of 9/11 and capitalized on the government\u2019s laser focus on preventing terror attacks. Now, Helberg said, the government is struggling with the \u201cgreat power competition\u201d with China. His role is to help Karp and the company figure out, \u201cWhat does that mean from a policy standpoint in Washington? What does that mean for Palantir\u2019s strategy?\u201d As my French onion soup arrived, the conversation shifted again to Trump. \u201cA true love story,\u201d Helberg laughed. \u201cWe just can\u2019t stay away from each other.\u201d Trump and Helberg first met in late 2023, at a Mar-a-Lago event hosted by the America First Policy Institute, a right-wing think tank. \u201cI was really blown away with the energy in the room,\u201d Helberg said. \u201cThe events in Mar-a-Lago are just a lot more fun than the traditional cookie-cutter Democratic event.\u201d He liked Trump\u2019s unscripted nature, his charisma and his hawkishness on China. Helberg donated $100,000 in February 2024 to attend a Mar-a-Lago roundtable with other donors; he used his allotted speaking time to advocate for tariffs on China, backing Israel and border security. \u201cHe loves tariffs,\u201d Helberg said. In fact, Helberg said, the former president joked with him that \u201cthe most beautiful words in the English language are tariffs.\u201d The two then had a one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower in New York in April and also saw each other at Formula One\u2019s Miami Grand Prix. In Miami, Helberg attended the race with his husband, Rabois. (Rabois was a major supporter of two other Republican 2024 contenders: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former North Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.) Helberg said his time with Trump has given him an opportunity \u201cto look my friends in the eye and tell them I\u2019ve met the guy, I\u2019ve talked to him, and I really believe that he should be the next leader of our country,\u201d Helberg said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just hard to do that if you\u2019re operating just off\u2026hearsay and TV.\u201d I asked if his Trumpism has put off any friends in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley. \u201cI was prepared to lose friends,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve actually been struck at how little pushback I\u2019ve received. And I think it\u2019s really a sign of the times. There\u2019s something in the air.\u201d Two days later, he was in San Francisco for Sacks\u2019 Trump fundraiser. A week after our day together in Washington, Helberg returned to town to meet with Rep. Scalise yet again. I found him once more holed up at the Waldorf Astoria, prepping for his day on the Hill. I asked what the future held for him. He gave a simple answer: Get Trump elected, no matter what the cost. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take anything off the table, including providing him with more resources or hosting events for him,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever the campaign asks.\u201d An earlier version of this story misspelled billionaire John Catsimatidis's name.

        "heading": "Why 187-Year-Old John Deere Is Hiring a Creator",

        "body_content": "Big brands are really coming around to influencer marketing after years of only dabbling in it, I reported in this story on Friday. The shift is causing even 187-year-old John Deere to rethink its marketing plans.  In April, the company announced it would hire a creator to run its short-form video strategy for a one-year contract that pays $200,000. This new hire, dubbed the first \u201cchief tractor officer,\u201d will also collaborate with influencers, or even other brands. \u201cWe have to be able to grab people\u2019s attention in someone\u2019s feed,\u201d said Jennifer Hartmann, John Deere\u2019s global director of strategic public relations and enterprise social media, in an interview. \u201cWe need to show up in a way that is surprising, that is fresh, with people that are a great fit for our brand.\u201d  John Deere has previously linked up with social-media famous farmers, such as Zach Johnson, better known as Millennial Farmer, who has more than 1 million YouTube subscribers. The creators are a way of introducing the brand to more people ages 18 to 35.  \u201cThe world is becoming less and less rural, [and] much more urban. As kids leave rural areas, they\u2019re becoming more and more disconnected from farming, where their food comes from,\u201d Hartmann said. Part of the goal of the new creator\u2019s role at John Deere is to introduce on social media the way those industries impact people\u2019s day-to-day lives. The company also wants to appeal to viewers with quirky, but less well-known facts about its business, like that its equipment is used at Wrigley Field and at national parks. John Deere expects to announce the hire by the end of this month. Here\u2019s a look at how some other big brands are allocating their budgets: \u2022 Fanta, the fruit-flavored soda brand owned by Coca-Cola, is spending almost half of its budget for the relaunch of its \u201cWanta Fanta\u201d campaign on social media advertising, including a sizable portion for influencer marketing. Rather than reprising the famous jingle from the aughts on traditional television, the company brought it back on TikTok by hiring a group of Gen Z creators in the U.S. to remix, dance to and lip-sync to the song.  \u2022 Jack in the Box for its fiscal year that ended October 1st, increased its social media and creator budget by 52% compared to the previous year. Its current fiscal year is seeing that same spending level, or slightly higher, the company said.  \u2022 Bodyarmor, a sports drink Coca-Cola also owns, has also boosted its spending on social media advertising, including creator partnerships, to about a third of its total budget, up from 15% to 20% two years ago. The increase in the budget has been driven by deals with creators like Dude Perfect.  \u2022 Other long-time TV advertisers, including Priceline and Allstate are now making strategic bets on influencer marketing this year.  \u201cWe\u2019re in a moment now, where there is not a brand who would think: Influencer marketing is not for me,\u201d said Brandon Perlman, the founder and CEO of influencer marketing agency Social Studies. Here\u2019s what else is going on\u2026 \u201cI need you guys to use your influence, and it doesn\u2019t have to be boring. I don\u2019t expect you to have a bunch of charts and graphs,\u201d Former President Barack Obama told 80 creators during a fundraiser for President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign over the weekend in Los Angeles, according to Axios. \u201cI understand folks are swiping or scrolling, and you\u2019ve got to use humor and you\u2019ve got to use other things that are engaging people.\u201d Obama acknowledged that the creators in the room \u201cmay not agree with everything\u201d Biden does, but said the current president \u201cbelieves in the basic things that you believe in.\u201d Creators have been a key strategy in Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, as The Information previously reported. But some of Biden\u2019s recent efforts have fumbled, including a testy exchange over military funding to Israel between him and Jonathan M. Katz, an independent journalist and critic of his administration, at a reception for social media influencers at the White House in April. Katz later posted the moment on TikTok to his more than 70,000 followers. See The Information\u2019s Creator Economy Database for an exclusive list of private companies and their investors. TikTok announced a new tool for marketers to use AI-generated avatars to promote products in their ads. Marketers will be able to choose from a set of stock avatars, based on video of paid human actors, or create their own custom avatars based on a brand spokesperson or creator. The Information first reported on the effort earlier this year.  X is planning to announce plans for longer videos on the social network, as well as deals with content providers at the advertising conference Cannes Lions this week, according to the Financial Times.  Webtoon Entertainment, a digital comics site with 24 million creators and about 170 million active users, is eyeing a valuation of up to $2.67 billion in a U.S. initial public offering. It\u2019s aiming to raise as much as $315 million by offering 15 million shares between $18 and $21 per share.  Amazon is working with ad-buying agency GroupM to make it easier for people to shop for products on Amazon Live\u2019s free, ad supported TV channel. Danone will be the first brand to participate in the new shoppable shows. This fall Danone will sell its Silk\u2019s new dairy-free coffee creamers in videos where creators try and review the product on Amazon\u2019s FAST channel. Viewers can shop for the item on their phone by typing \u201cshop the show\u201d into the search bar of the Amazon Shopping app. They\u2019ll then see products seen on their TV screen and can add them to the cart to purchase.  AfterHour, a social trading app, raised $4.5 million in seed funding co-led by Founders Fund and General Catalyst. Kairos Group, a London-based creative agency and influencer marketing firm, raised an undisclosed amount of new funding from venture capital firm BGF and rebranded to NewGen.  Beacons, best known as a link-in-bio startup, released its second annual list of top creator agencies, which now includes more than 240 companies, up from 125 a year ago.  ICYMI: TikTok launched a video series called Off the Record that features top artists discussing the story behind their new albums. It kicked off last week with Meghan Trainor and other artists. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general, called for a warning label on social media apps in an opinion essay in the New York Times on Monday, which would state that \u201csocial media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency.\u201d  NBCUniversal is bringing 27 creators to the Paris Olympics in July to reach younger audiences. The media company worked with Meta Platforms, sports media company Overtime, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube to develop the program, which it\u2019s calling the Paris Creator Collective. \u201cFrom the athletes to the food to the celebration, creators will offer their communities of fans a truly unique, engaging look,\u201d said Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics, in a statement.  The Free Press, an independent, conservative media company started by former New York Times op-ed writer Bari Weiss, now counts more than 100,000 paying subscribers and nearly 700,000 subscribers total. An annual subscription costs $80 per year. Read our previous reporting on The Free Press.  Harry Daniels, a TikTok creator known for serenading celebrities off-tune and filming their responses, signed with talent agency UTA. Programming note: We\u2019ll be off on Wednesday for Juneteenth.

        "body_content": "Modern technology is everywhere, often in various forms of screen time. That makes it a popular scapegoat for the increasing, collective loss of our human connection to the natural world. It\u2019s not just that time spent using technology has replaced time in nature, it\u2019s also that for many nature is farther away: Over half the world\u2019s population now lives in urban settings, a figure that rises to around 80% in high-income regions such as North America, Japan and Western Europe. As this disconnect from nature spreads, we are also learning that spending time in nature is integral to our overall health and happiness. Studies have shown that even simple acts like a walk in a city park and observing birds and wildlife provide a greater sense of connection and well-being. Luckily, on the flip side of our world of modern technology are incredible tech-driven programs that can help bridge this disconnect. When Sean Taylor, chief scientist at Motif Analytics, a data startup, wants to venture outside and away from his West Oakland home, he reaches for AllTrails. (The app has lately seen its popularity greatly expand past its cult following\u2014so much so that Apple has recently moved to copy-cat it.) \u201cIf I want to find a beautiful place to walk or hike, there are so many options with tons of details, photos, and reviews,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cWithout AllTrails, I'd probably never overcome the activation energy to get to some of these places.\u201d Natalie Down, an environment technology and communications consultant who lives in Half Moon Bay, Calif., enjoys the Merlin Bird ID app from Cornell University, which lives up to its namesake, she said. \u201cOne of the things I love about Merlin was the ability to have it on in the background, listen to the birds and then magically \u2026 watch the app identify the birds.\u201d Beside enriching lives one at a time, conservationists hope some of these apps will move people to care about the natural habitats of plants and animals and how they enrich our own lives. After all, it usually holds true that what\u2019s good for us and what\u2019s good for the rest of nature are the same thing. This app from Cornell University\u2019s Lab of Ornithology can identify over 10,000 species of birds by image or by birdsong. Users can download a bird data pack for their home area or a travel location for the most accurate identifications; you can also enter photos or record sounds in the app. Each sound or image presented brings up information like name, habitat, migration range and other interesting facts about the birds, which you can save in a \u201clife list.\u201d (Recently, the app helped me confirm a bird near our house in Wyoming as a northern flicker, a type of woodpecker with beautiful, leopard-like coloring, as well as identify the melodious song of the Western meadowlark in a sagebrush meadow.) User data from citizen scientists helps Cornell and other researchers around the world monitor birds for habitat conservation and policy recommendations. All in all, it\u2019s a comprehensive, well-designed app. It\u2019s an easy and delightful way to enrich your daily life and engage children with these little ambassadors of nature, whether on vacation in Costa Rica or peering into the branches of a sidewalk tree on Manhattan\u2019s West Side Highway. (Free) There\u2019s a reason AllTrails is one of the most popular apps for finding the perfect trail for running, hiking, cycling, or pushing a stroller\u2014just about anywhere. You can filter by location and difficulty (easy, moderate, hard), so you aren\u2019t wasting time or feeling apprehensive about over- or under-committing yourself. As a search engine, it accesses hundreds of thousands of trails around the globe with images, difficulty ratings, whether dogs are allowed and reviews from fellow trail users (but in-house AllTrails experts vet public input to maintain the app\u2019s reliability). Many users such as Shobeir Shobeiri, a senior director at Mintegral, an ad tech outfit, use AllTrails to filter allowed trail uses. \u201cI use AllTrails because I love finding dog-friendly trails,\u201d said Shobeiri, of Sonoma, Calif., who says it\u2019s a great way to find beach outings and other walks where he and his pooch are welcomed. The free version is great and offers all the basic trail information and route recording features. The paid version allows you to download maps for offline use, track your route with wrong turn alerts and access its National Park guides. (A basic free version and a premium version at $35.99 annually.) OnX offers comprehensive geospatial mapping for various types of outdoor activities, including hunting, off-roading, hiking and rock climbing. It benefits from a well-designed\u2014and quite user-friendly\u2014app interface that makes it a pleasure to explore its comprehensive terrain and land ownership maps, which allow you to plan routes and understand public land rules; you\u2019ll know if your routes run through a national forest, federal wilderness or even private land. OnX also includes important reminders such as notifications about critical wintering wildlife areas, which are seasonally closed to human use on otherwise public land\u2014a great reminder to respect our fellow creatures out there. (Later this year, you can use OnX\u2019s winter mode, in which you\u2019ll find popular resort ski runs as well as backcountry trailheads\u2014known ascent and descent routes\u2014with slope angles, past avalanche events and runout zones to avoid.) Download offline maps for areas with spotty or no cell service. (A free basic version, as well as a $9 premium and $30 elite version.) This nature identification app is a wonderful tool for families and children. It highlights the natural world\u2019s existence in even the most urban spots\u2014including the tiniest forms of flora or fauna. See a funny mushroom or moss growing next to a patio? Or a little frog at a pond? The app uses your phone\u2019s camera with image recognition technology and data from iNaturalist, the California Academy of Sciences and National Geographic to analyze images and identify amphibians, fungi, wildlife and plants. The information collected when using Seek is not shared with the public, making it an ideal app for kids to use. My only warning: The app tends to be so fascinating, your average moving speed is likely to plummet. (Free) Stargazing has been a font of wonder, storytelling and mythology for humans for millennia. Even though many people now live in cities where light pollution dims or obscures the twinkling celestial bodies that awed our ancestors, we know more about them than ever. Two straightforward apps offer great tools for beginner astronomers of all ages. Night Sky is an excellent option for iOS users. Point your phone at the sky, and the app fills in details about the constellations and galaxies above. It has an augmented reality feature that offers labels you can tap on for information about what\u2019s above, and that can adjust for light pollution. The app works on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Vision Pro (you may remember it appeared on a list of our favorite Vision Pro apps).($5.99 a month or $39.99 annually.) Also consider Stellarium, which works with iOS and Android (with a free version, as well as a $19.99 premium version), and offers amateur stargazers an impressively comprehensive catalog of objects in the night sky with an easy-to-use interface.
